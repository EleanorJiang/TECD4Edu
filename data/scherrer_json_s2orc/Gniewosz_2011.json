    "abstract": "This study focuses on processes involved in students' academic self-concept constructions before, during, and after secondary school transition. The study is based on a four-wave longitudinal dataset (N = 1953). Structural equation modeling showed that during school transition, the impact of grades on students' academic self-concepts in Math and English decreased whereas the effects of maternal competence perceptions increased. After the transition, the effects of grades increased, while the effects maternal competence beliefs decreased again. The results are interpreted in terms of differential emphasizing of sources of information for students' self-concept construction. During school transition, elementary school grades lost informational value for selfevaluations due to the changed frame of reference. To secure stable and valid selfassessments, students emphasized other sources than grades; in this, case information obtained through parental competence appraisals. After transition, when valid grades were available for the students' constructions again, the temporarily heightened parental influence decreased again.",

Students begin school with unrealistically high expectations and ability beliefs (Eccles, Midgley, & Adler, 1984; Nicholls, 1979) and become more accurate in their self-evaluations and expectations with growing experience in achievement-related situations (Eccles, Wigfield, Harold, & Blumenfeld, 1993; Spinath & Spinath, 2005) . Thus, in the course of development, the self-concept of ability is assumed to become increasingly accurate and stable at the inter-individual level (Harter, 1998; Marsh, 1990) . However, work originating from social psychological theorizing has shown that self-evaluations, such as self-concepts of ability, themselves as well as the processes of self-evaluation are flexible and driven by individual motives, such as self-verification (individuals' striving for highly certain self-knowledge), self-enhancement (individuals' striving for favorable selfknowledge), or self-assessment (individuals' striving for accurate self-knowledge) (Elliot & Mapes, 2005; Festinger, 1954 Festinger, , 1957 Sedikides, 1993) . These motives for stable, accurate, and positive self-images lead to a selective processing of available information in the construction of self-beliefs. Self-concept, therefore, is seen as an adaptive construct at the individual level.",

Grades serve as competence indicators in several ways. They constitute an external frame of reference within an academic domain and an internal frame of reference between different academic domains (Marsh, 1986; . The external, between-student frame of reference describes social comparisons with other students on the same dimension, for example, 'In math I am better than most of the other students'. The internal, within-student frame of reference is defined as dimensional comparisons, for example, 'I am better in math than in English'.",

There is a large body of research showing that the ability beliefs by significant others, such as peers (Cole, Maxwell, & Martin, 1997) and teachers (Bouchey & Harter, 2005; Cole et al., 1997; Spinath & Spinath, 2005 ) affect students' selfperceptions. By the same line of argument, the role of parents as interpreters of reality has been demonstrated convincingly (Bouchey & Harter; Dai, 2002; Frome & Eccles, 1998; Gniewosz, 2010; Jacobs & Eccles, 1992; Spinath & Spinath) . Thus, students construct their ability beliefs based on both achievement-related feedback (grades) and the appraisals of their parents. Parents can communicate their perception of their offspring's achievement in a variety of ways: for example, parents may provide different learning opportunities based on their views of their children's ability or they may directly tell their children which skills the children are best at. According to the Eccles et al. model of parental influences on motivational beliefs, children interpret these cues and incorporate them into the self-concept of ability (Jacobs, Davis-Kean, Bleeker, Eccles, & Malanchuk, 2005; Jacobs & Eccles, 2000) .",

A prominent model addressing this line of thought is the internal/external frame of reference model (Marsh, 1986; Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002) . Research has provided evidence that students use achievement-related feedback in terms of grades (e.g., Marsh & Hau, 2004; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1995) and parental competence perceptions (Gniewosz, 2010) , from more than one domain in their own competence assessments in a given academic domain. Thus, when depicting processes involved in adolescents' self-concept constructions, it is important to consider sources of information from more than one academic domain. We chose the domains of Math and English because both can serve as proxies for the major domains of the academic self-concept: mathematical and verbal.",

Although there are individual patterns of changes after school transitions (Berndt & Mekos, 1995; Harter, Whitesell, & Kowalski, 1992; McDougall & Hymel, 1998) , there are some general developments. A decline in the self-concept of ability ratings or competence beliefs in almost all subjects at school is well documented during elementary and secondary school (e.g., Cole et al., 2001; Eccles et al., 1984; Meckelmann; Spinath & Spinath, 2005; Wigfield, Eccles, Mac Iver, Reuman, & Midgley, 1991) .

The transition to secondary school marks a change in school environment. After the transition, students are placed in new classrooms that can be regarded as new frames of reference. They have to cope with new peers (targets of social comparisons) and teachers (sources of comparison information). Moreover, a lot of structural changes take place. Students are confronted with a stronger emphasis on teacher authority (Harter et al., 1992; Midgley, Feldlaufer, & Eccles, 1988 , ability grouping , less autonomy (Harter et al., 1992; Seidman, Allen, Aber, & Mitchell, 1994) , more social comparisons implied by feedback structures (Harter et al., 1992; Rosenholtz & Simpson, 1984) , and stricter grading practices Finger & Silverman, 1996) , than in elementary school. These changes, together with the disruption of earlier social networks (Wigfield, Byrnes, & Eccles, 2006) , do not fit the developmental changes starting around puberty, namely the intensified need for autonomy, peer orientation, and identity formation (cf. Eccles, Wigfield, & Schiefele, 1998; Wigfield & Wagner, 2005) . This poor fit of individual (stage) and contextual (environment) changes is argued to lead to the declining ability beliefs during school transition.",

But due to changes in grading practices and changes in the frames of reference after the transition Finger & Silverman, 1996) , grades originating from the time before the transition may lose their predictive power for the construction of competence-related beliefs following the transition. Since there is the basic need for competence-related self-evaluation (Deci & Moller, 2005; Festinger, 1954; James, 1892) , and a motive for consistent and stable (self-verification motive) as well as accurate self-assessments (Elliot & Mapes, 2005; Festinger, 1957; Sedikides, 1993) , the individual can be expected to fill this information gap by active information seeking (Pomerantz, Saxon, & Kenney, 2001; Ruble, 1994; Ruble & Seidman, 1996) . The decreased amount of information derived from elementary school grades for the academic self-concept constructions during school transition might lead to increased exploration because of the individual's need for stable and accurate self-views (see self-verification and self-assessment motives). Therefore, other sources of information than grades may become more important for the construction of the academic self-concept during such transitional times in order to fill the information gap. Given the prominent role of parents as social sources of information, an increase in parental influence on students' competence-related beliefs can be expected.",

Research has shown that the parental perceptions of the student's competencies are important sources for the student's ability belief constructions (e.g., Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Frome & Eccles, 1998; Spinath & Spinath, 2005) . We expect parental competence perceptions to be less affected by school transition and more stable than the students' ability beliefs because parents base their competence appraisals of their children on observations over a longer time period as compared to the grade time frame of one term or one school year. Moreover, parents have the opportunity to observe their offspring dealing with ability-related tasks in situations outside the school setting, for example, reading, solving Sudoku puzzles. Thus, parental perceptions of their offspring's academic abilities based on these observations together with the information obtained from the school-based achievement feedback can be expected to be less susceptible to changes in the school context. Therefore, information obtained through parental perceptions is expected to provide a valid source of information for the students' own construction during the time of school transition. Accordingly, we expect the effect of the parental competence perceptions to be increased during the time of school transition.",

Data of wave three and four were collected in fall and spring term of the seventh grade (1984) . The junior high school transition took place between waves two and three. Twelve school districts located in low-to middle-income communities participated. The districts are located within a 50-mile radius of a large city in the Midwestern USA. Almost 90 percent of the students in these districts are of European-American descent; families served by these schools are predominantly middle class. All the teachers who taught Mathematics to sixth-grade students scheduled to make a transition the next year to junior high were recruited for the first two waves of data collection; 95 percent of the teachers (117 classrooms from 55 schools) agreed to participate. All of these teachers' students were asked to participate in the study, and 79 percent agreed and received parental permission. All of the year 2 (third and fourth wave of data collection) Math teachers agreed to participate in the study. There was an attrition rate of 14 percent in the students' sample, almost entirely due to students' families moving out of the sampled school districts. For this study, the data of the students attending sixth grade at T1 was used (N = 1953). Approximately 1850 students completed questionnaires at all four waves.

In case of missing completely at random (MCAR), cases with missing data could have been deleted Transition and Self-concept 543 without biased parameter estimations. In order to avoid losing statistical power and the missing values in math self-concepts not being MCAR, we chose a model-based approach of dealing with missing data. Using the software used Mplus 4.2 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2006) , the MLR estimator was employed. Thus, cases with missing data were not excluded, but all model parameters were estimated, based on the cases with complete data and the (conditional) missing values under the missing at random assumption (Arbuckle, 1996) . A correlation table of all variables in the structural equation models and the missing values in the relevant constructs is presented in the appendix (Table A1 ). The low number of missing values could be predicted by the grades. Thus, low achieving students were more likely to have missing values.",

The processes involved in self-evaluations are assumed to be flexible. Several motives or situational characteristics can affect the choice of the sources of information (e.g., Mussweiler, 2003; Pomerantz et al., 2001 ). If one regards the self-concept of ability as a flexible construction based on information from various sources (Eccles, 1984; Harter, 1998; Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002) , some of these sources may lose informational value if the frame of reference changes. Grades obtained in elementary school can be regarded as predictive only in the context in which they were given. It has been shown that grades are good indicators of achievement but only within classroom (Hoge & Coladarci, 1989; Trautwein et al., 2006; Valtin et al., 2002) . Therefore, the grades obtained in elementary school are not regarded as the best competence indicator by the students during school transition, as indicated by the decreases in the regression weights. To compensate for this decrease in the validity of elementary school grades, the implicit achievementrelated feedback obtained through parental competence perceptions appeared to increase in value in the construction process of the academic self-evaluations. This source of information was shown to be more stable during this time of change. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that information inferred from the parental competence perception would be considered more reliable by the students and therefore emphasized.",

Much of their work has focused on cross-domain effects of grades on domain-specific self-concepts. We found no evidence of such grade effects but did find evidence of the predicted negative cross-domain effects for maternal ratings of their children's Math and English abilities. The reason for the non-significant cross-domain grade effects may be the mediation of these effects through the maternal competence perceptions. This pattern has been shown on a German dataset as well (Gniewosz, 2010) . Within domain, parents include achievement-related information into their competence perceptions. Since students include information derived from these perceptions from various domains, crossdomain grade effects on academic self-concepts can be mediated through the parents' competence beliefs. Thus, within and cross-domain effects contribute to the students constructions.",

At the same time, parental views become stronger predictors over the transitional period. We assume that this might be a more general effect. Individuals' self-concepts of ability emerge out of a plethora of informational sources, such as grades, immediate and previous appraisals by parents and teachers, immediate comparisons with peers, and internal comparisons across subject areas. Due to developmental status or various other situational characteristics, such as school transitions, the relative importance of these sources may shift. If one informational source is perceived as less predictive or helpful for the construction of competence beliefs, others may be weighted more strongly to keep a sufficient evaluation base for this construction. The underlying process may stem from the motivation for self-concept evaluation. There are at least three basic motives linked to the self-concept construction: self-enhancement-the desire for a positive self-concept (Brown, 1991; Greenwald, 1980) , self-verification-the desire for self-concept consistency and stability (Festinger, 1957; Swann, Rentfrow, & Guinn, 2003) , and selfassessment-the desire for accurate self-perceptions (Festinger, 1954; Trope & Pomerantz, 1998) . Related to the presented findings, the change in the relative importance of parental perceptions vs. grades is best interpreted within the frame of selfverification and self-assessment motives. In order to keep a stable, consistent, and accurate competence self-evaluation, the most stable and diagnostic information is selected (e.g., Atkinson, 1964; Sedikides, 1993) . Our flexibility assumption is directed toward the use of informational sources. As the general level of the inter-individual stabilities indicate, self-concepts of abilities are more or less stable on that level. Flexibility, however, has been shown in the process of keeping these constructions stable, following self-verification and self-assessment motives.",

Firstly, we cannot rule out the possibility that the changes in the result patterns interpreted as school transition effects are driven by comparing within-school year (pre and post transition) to between-school year (spring term sixth grade vs. fall term seventh grade) effects. Between-school year data either pre or postschool transition would be needed to be sure about the school transition as the causal factor leading to this shift in the use of informational sources. But this kind of data was not available. However, even if the school transition is not the causal factor underlying the shift in the predictive values of grades and parental competence perceptions, the effect pattern and the interpretation in terms of a flexible use of information in the construction of academic self-concepts remains the same: During contextual changes (school transition or frame of reference changes due to between school year changes) one source of information becomes less predictive whereas another source is emphasized to secure a valid and stable self-evaluation. Secondly, our sample is restricted to a specific age group and a specific transition time point. Older students might not consider parent-related information a valid source due individuation processed during adolescence. Thus, further research employing different age groups/different transition time points is needed. Thirdly, the study was restricted to maternal data. Other sources of information, such as fathers, peers, and teachers on academic competence should be considered in further research. Fourthly, the data was collected in the 1980s. We do not necessarily think that the age of the dataset would affect the result patterns because the relations between the investigated constructs (academic selfconcepts, grades, parental competence beliefs) are largely the same across various studies, conducted over the last 30 years (e.g., Frome & Eccles, 1998 vs. Gniewosz, 2010 . Furthermore, the structural characteristics of the context change induced by secondary school transition did not change much as well. However, future research should replicate the presented findings.",
