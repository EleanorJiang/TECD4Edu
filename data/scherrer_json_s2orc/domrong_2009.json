The adequate education makes good quality human resources for a rapidly developing country. According to this reason, many countries have been trying to develop the educational quality in the national policy and strategy to enhance effective implementation. As in Thailand, this idea dominantly appears in An Education Reform Act for Further Development for The Thai People: National Education Act of B.C. 2542. The major content emphasizes the development of many functions of Thai educational system. When the act was implemented during 1999-2005, the educational organization reported the results of student's outcomes. The student's academic achievements in five important subjects were under 50% every year or under a satisfying level, especially in Mathematics and English subjects. This crisis raised many questions about educational development process because the act cannot improve the student's academic achievement that everyone had expected.",

Some country have been trying to solve this problem by educational staff development, teaching processes, and parent and community cooperation, and some country have been looking backward to student inner character by depicting causal relationship influencing to academic achievement. The result of studies revealed some important factor strongly related with academic achievement is \"self-concept\", the perception of oneself about strength, weakness, value, belief, and attitude from environment or social interaction (Longres, 1995; Marsh & Craven, 1997; Slavin, 2003; Huitt, 2004; Jordan & Porath, 2006; Suldo, Riley, & Shaffer, 2006; Fraine, Damme, & Onghena, 2007) . Selfconcept was explored since 1980's and divided into two main factors academic self-concept and nonacademic self-concept (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985; Marsh, 1990) , the person who have positive self-concept frequently success in activities but easily fail in activities for who have negative self-concept (Wigfield & Karpathian 1991; Franken, 1994) . From later research results show more important of academic self-concept than nonacademic selfconcept, the variances explain in academic achievement from academic self-concept greater than nonacademic self-concept (Lyon, 1993; William, 1993) . It was supported many later researches to study just only academic self-concept factor for improving student academic achievement and neglect an important of nonacademic self-concept though its closely related with the student's real life more than academic self-concept (William, 1993; Longres, 1995; Suntonrapot, Auyporn, & Thaweewat, 2008; Suntonrapot, Auyporn, & Thaweewat, 2009) , it's imply the studies of self-concept were not transparency in self-concept factors. However, the recent development of research methodology in self-concept aspect elucidated the important equally between academic self-concept and nonacademic self-concept to academic achievement in short-term and long-term period. Furthermore, the academic self-concept has variance explain in academic achievement more than academic self-concept comparatively (Suntonrapot et al, 2008; Suntonrapot et al, 2009) . These research results provided important information for the teacher and the school administrator to set appropriate activities in time frame for enhancing positive self-concept of students and becoming to enhance student academic achievement in the future.",

The new dominant methodology for studying the relationship is \"Causal Ordering Model\", the repeated measure model generated from the chicken-egg question for study longitudinal relationship comprised with four effect directions (Suntonrapot et al, 2009) . The results of causal ordering analysis provide many important effects between different times from the same variable (Horizontal Effect) and between different variables (Bottom-up, Top-down, and Reciprocal Effect) . Although causal ordering model makes clearly in long-term interaction effect between two or more variables, its potential cannot be considered the growth of variables during long-term period. Currently, the most suitable analytical methodology considering growth of variable is \"the latent growth curve approach\", the methodology was developed from autoregressive model and growth curve model (Duncan, Duncan, Strycker, Li, & Alpert, 1999) for modeling growth of individuals over time by a random coefficient model on a latent variable level (Meredith & Tisak, 1990) and was applied to use with the structural equation modeling (SEM) to predict parameters in the model deeply, manifestly and efficiently. The interesting character of the latent growth curve model is 1) the competency for goodness of fit testing of hypothetical model and 2) its take the correlation between each time of variable measurements to estimate the parameters. Hence, the latent growth curve model can show information more clearly than the causal ordering model comparatively.",

The multivariate latent growth curve model comprised with three variables in the model. Each variable received three time measures and each measure was used four months approximately. Three time points provide an opportunity to test for nonlinear trajectories (Duncan et al, 1999) for designed shape of hypothetical model. The first variable was academic achievement (ACH) measured from the academic score in Mathematics, English, Science, and Thai Language subjects, the second variable was academic self-concept (ASC) measured from Mathematics academic self-concept, English academic self-concept, Science academic self-concept, and Thai Language academic self-concept, and the last variable was nonacademic self-concept (NSC) measured from physical ability, peer relation, physical appearance, and self-efficacy. The another important view, this study have tried to develop the model explained academic self-concept, nonacademic self-concept, and academic achievement growth of nine-grad students in Thailand which were teenagers, the girl and boy groups have different growth (McInerney & McInerney, 1995; Jordan et al, 2006) .

The result of latent growth curve model development and validation, the model was vary good fit with the empirical data with \u03c7 2 =25.240, df=24, p=0.393, RMSEA=0.008, CFI=1.000, RMR=0.031, GFI=0.994 and AGFI=0.989. The academic achievement was the highest mean of initial (18.047) and slope (1.025). Between two factors of self-concept, the initial of nonacademic self-concept was slightly greater than academic self-concept (2.852/2.661) but the slope of academic self-concept was slightly greater than nonacademic self-concept (0.078/0.060). All parameter estimators were statistical significant at .01 level. For observed variables, all variables have high reliability level (0.735-0.996). The parameter estimators in the model bring to consider growth of academic self-concept, nonacademic selfconcept, and academic achievement during one academic year. The academic achievement has initial level and growth rate higher than other variables. The initial and slope of academic self-concept and nonacademic self-concept were pertinent. The growth of nonacademic selfconcept was slightly higher than academic self-concept. However, the growth between academic self-concept and nonacademic self-concept were closely over and over from early to lately academic year. It was implied that the initial of academic achievement was expected to increase by 1.025 each year, the initial of academic self-concept was expected to increase by 0.078 each year, and the initial of nonacademic self-concept was expected to increase by 0.060 each year.

The result of three invariance hypothesis testing comparison show the second hypothesis, the parameter variance just only the correlation of measurement error of observed variables (TE), was the best fit with the empirical data to explain growth parameter between boy and girl groups. All parameter of growth variables between boy and girl group were statistical significant at .01 level. The details of multiple group analysis were shown in Table 4 and Table 5 . From multiple group analysis processes, the parameters of growth were depicted in comparing aspect in Figure 3 . rely on the second invariance hypothesis testing. The growth of academic achievement between boy and girl were very closely all of the academic year [see Figure 3A .], the growth of academic self-concept was closely in the early period of academic year but it has just started slightly different from the middle to the lately period of academic year [see Figure 3B ], and the growth of nonacademic self-concept was relevant to academic self-concept that appeared different growth rate of two groups of student, the girl group was higher growth of nonacademic self-concept than boy group [see Figure 3C. ]. It's should notified the different growth rate between boy and girl groups in the lately period of academic year of nonacademic self-concept was more obviously than academic self-concept. Figure 3 . Growth of Academic Achievement, Academic Self-concept, and Nonacademic Self-concept between Boys and Girls Discussion 1. The result of latent growth curve model development and validation show the model was good fit with the empirical data due more than 90% of variables in the model have statistical significant in high level. It was supported from suggestion of prior researchers about extremely high relationship between self-concept and academic achievement. Moreover, this study was designed to study with many of research samples which effected to correlation coefficient of variables and goodness of fit statistics of hypothesis model (Duncan et al, 1999) .",
