A total of 206 Finnish students (100 girls, 106 boys) were followed from grade 7 to grade 9, just before an important transition from compulsory comprehensive school to secondary education occurs in the Finnish context. Students' parents participated in the study when the students were in grade 7. The results of multivariate latent change models showed that interest and importance values and their development in one particular subject were associated with one another. Mothers' and fathers' beliefs seemed to play a different role in relation to task values, and this role also varied according to the subject: mothers' ability beliefs predicted the students' level of interest in mathematics and evaluation of the importance of literacy. However, fathers' ability beliefs were found to predict the changes related to interest and importance values in mathematics. The role of gender in students' values was more evident in the case of literacy than in mathematics.",

                "text": "Subject-specific task values, that is, the interest and importance that students attach to different school subjects, have been found to be important predictors of several academic outcomes, such as educational enrollment decisions (Bong, 2001; Simpkins, Davis-Kean, & Eccles, 2006; Viljaranta, Nurmi, Aunola, & Salmela-Aro, 2009) and career plans (Watt, 2006) . Eccles and colleagues (1983; outline in their parent socialization model that children's task values are partly based on parents' beliefs. However, the few studies carried out on the topic have mainly concerned the role of mothers' beliefs and behaviors (Aunola, Viljaranta, Lehtinen, & Nurmi, 2013; Harackiewicz, Rozek, Hulleman, & Hyde, 2012; Simpkins, Fredricks, & Eccles, 2012) , and less is known about the role of fathers' beliefs (Simpkins, Fredricks, & Eccles, 2015) . The present study aims to fill in this gap in the previous literature by examining the effect of mothers' and fathers' beliefs about individual children's abilities, as well as the role of a child's gender, on the development of adolescents' interest and importance values in mathematics and literacy from grade 7 to grade 9 in comprehensive school in a Finnish school context. Because the majority of previous studies focusing on this topic have been carried out in educational systems where the first important educational transitions take place in a relatively early phase, such as in the United States or Australia, this study also aims to broaden previous knowledge by focusing on a different educational context. In Finland, all students follow a relatively similar curriculum in compulsory schooling until grade 9, and it is only after grade 9 that the first major educational transition to either upper secondary or vocational school occurs. Therefore, this study focuses on the development of task values just before the important transition from compulsory comprehensive school to secondary education takes place.",

Results concerning overall task values have shown, for example, that the task value attributed to math declines during high-school years, whereas that attributed to language declines during earlier school years and stabilizes during high-school years among American students (Jacobs et al., 2002) . Studies focusing on different aspects of task values have shown somewhat similar results. Frenzel, Goetz, Pekrun, and Watt (2010) found a downward trend in the development of mathematics relating to interest value from grades 5 to 9 among German students. Watt (2004) , in turn, found that among Australian adolescents, interest value in mathematics declined consistently throughout the school years and stabilized only in the senior years of high school, while interest value in literacy also declined during the seventh grade but showed minor recovery after grade 7. In regard to importance value, Eccles and colleagues (1989) found that among a US sample, the mathematics importance value decreased from the beginning of sixth-grade elementary school to the end of seventh-grade junior high school, while the importance value of literacy increased during grade 6 and dropped after the transition to high school (Eccles et al., 1989) . Watt (2004) found that the utility value (which is one aspect of importance value in the present study) attached to mathematics declined through grades 7 to 11, and the utility value attached to literacy at first declined and after grade 7 stabilized. Previous literature has found that gender plays a role in the development of task values. This literature will be reviewed in more detail in a later part of this Introduction.",

                "text": "At least two major explanations have been given for the declining trend of task values. First, it has been suggested that during school years students become better at understanding and integrating the evaluative feedback they receive, which might affect their valuation of certain subjects . Another explanation is that school environments change in school transitions in a way that makes evaluation more salient and competition between students more likely, and that, owing to this, some students' assessments of their values become more negative during their adolescent years . One shortcoming of the previous research on the development of task values, however, is that the majority has been carried out among US or Australian samples. As cultural socialization shapes individuals' values (Wigfield, Tonks, & Eccles, 2004) , more research is needed on task value development in different cultural and school contexts. The Finnish school system differs from that of many European countries and the United States because the first major educational transition, that is, transition to upper secondary education, takes place only after grade 9 (at the age of 15 or 16), and there is no tracking before that transition. Therefore, the present study examines the level of and change in students' interest and importance value for math and literacy from grade 7 to grade 9 in Finland.",

In particular, parents' perceptions of their children's abilities play a role in children's values via many mechanisms. For example, parental beliefs may be reflected in parenting behaviors, and they can be communicated to adolescents in different ways, such as expectations (see Jacobs & Eccles, 2000) . Empirical findings have been in line with expectancy-value theory (e.g., Chouinard, Karsenti, & Roy (2007) , showing especially that mothers' beliefs about their children's abilities in mathematics in particular are related to their children's task values during later school years (Eccles & Jacobs, 1986; Wigfield & al., 1997) . However, contradictory findings have also been reported: in the study by Jacobs and Bleeker (2004) neither mothers' nor fathers' beliefs about mathematics ability (Year 2) predicted their children's later interest in mathematics (Year 8). One possible reason for these contradictory findings might be the differences in the design of the studies. It is possible that relationships between parents' beliefs and children's task values are found only when these aspects are measured closely enough to each other.",

First, several studies have shown that students' gender plays a salient role in their parents' beliefs about their ability in both mathematics (Eccles, Jacobs, & Harold, 1990; Jacobs, 1991; Tiedemann, 2000) and literacy (Eccles et al., 1990; Frome & Eccles, 1998) . For example, Frome and Eccles (1998) found that mothers of daughters held higher ability beliefs regarding their children's literacy skills than mothers of sons -which corresponded with girls' higher observed grades in literacy. In addition, Tiedemann (2000) showed that mothers as well as fathers perceived boys to be more competent at mathematics than girls although there were no gender differences in students' mathematics performance. However, there are also studies where these kinds of effects of children's gender on parents' ability beliefs have not been found in regard to mathematics Jacobs (1991) . For example, Frome and Eccles (1998) did not find that mothers' or fathers' ratings of children's mathematics ability depended on the children's gender. Yee and Eccles (1988) , in turn, demonstrated that fathers but not mothers held lower math achievement standards for their daughters in seventh grade than for their sons. These contradictory findings reveal an evident need for studying the role of gender in relation to both mothers' and fathers' beliefs in several different subject fields.",

                "text": "There are at least two important aspects of the Finnish context that make Finland an interesting environment for the development of task values. First, as mentioned earlier, the Finnish school system is unlike that of many European countries and the United States in that the transition to secondary education takes place only after grade 9. Finnish children start comprehensive school at the age of seven and continue without tracking until grade 9. Therefore, all students receive relatively similar education until the end of grade 9. The time period that is the subject of the present study is characterized by planning and applying for future education, and previous literature suggests that task values provide an important basis for these future enrollment aspirations and decisions (Viljaranta et al., 2009; Watt et al., 2012) . At the same time, there is a need to perform well because students' achievement is a strong criterion for entrance to further education after grade 9, and students' values have been shown to predict their performance (K\u00f6ller, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, & Baumert, 2006) . The second interesting feature of the Finnish educational context is adolescents' achievement level: in Finland, girls outperform boys in literacy, and there are no gender differences in performance in mathematics (OECD, 2013) and in eighth-graders' mathematics test scores (519); in addition, reading test scores (524) were higher than the OECD mean score (494 in mathematics, 496 in reading) in the 2012 study of the International Programme of Student Assessment Study 2012 (PISA). Therefore, adolescents' achievement level is, in general, relatively good, and in the case of mathematics, boys and girls have equal skill. Therefore, the focus of the present study is on the development of task values between grades 7 and 9 in a Finnish context.",

In the case of literacy, we expected that the level of interest would be stabilized (Jacobs et al., 2002; Watt, 2004) . We further expected that the importance value for mathematics would decline from grade 7 to grade 9 (Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Watt, 2004) , and that for literacy it would show a slight decrease or stability (Watt, 2004) . However, the previous studies have been carried out mainly in the USA and in Australia. The educational systems in those countries differ from the Finnish system, which might account for different results being found in varying educational contexts. 2) We expected that levels of students' interest and importance value would be moderately to highly intercorrelated in grade 7 and grade 9 (Eccles & Wigfield, 1995; Watt et al., 2012) . Furthermore, we expected that changes in interest and importance value would be positively associated, i.e., increases in interest values would be associated with increases in importance values, and decreases in interest values would be associated with decreases in importance values. 3) We expected that both mothers' and fathers' child-specific ability beliefs in mathematics and literacy would positively predict the level of and change in interest and importance value within each domain (Wigfield et al., (1997) when the level of students' achievement is controlled for. 4) We expected that, in the case of mathematics, parents' beliefs about their children's abilities would be similar for boys and girls (Andre, Whigham, Hendrickson, & Chambers, 1999; Frome & Eccles, 1998) but that, in the case of literacy, their beliefs would be higher regarding girls (Frome & Eccles, 1998) . In addition, we expected boys to show a higher level of interest in mathematics than girls (Frenzel et al., 2010; Watt, 2004) but to ascribe to it an equal level of importance (Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Watt, 2004) . In the case of literacy, we expected girls to show higher interest and ascribe more importance than boys (Jacobs et al., 2002; Watt, 2004) .",

Data was assessed from two medium-sized districts in central Finland, including both urban and semi-urban areas. Students were followed through their kindergarten and comprehensive school years. The present study focuses on grades 7 and 9. Students were given questionnaires during the spring term of each grade. The sample consisted of 206 students (100 girls, 106 boys), who participated at both measurement points. Of this total, 190 students came from 16 different classrooms in four different schools. Sixteen students who had been part of the original larger study but moved away from the study district before grade 7 were also included in the sample. These students all came from different locations around Finland. At both measurement points, students were asked to fill out a questionnaire on their task values concerning mathematics and literacy as school subjects. In grade 7, they were also asked to report their previous grades in these subjects. In the spring term of grade 7, students' parents (N of mothers = 197, N of fathers = 171) were asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding their beliefs about their children's skills in mathematics and literacy.",

Two of these items measured expectations concerning the student's mathematics abilities (How well do you think your child is doing in mathematics? How well do you think your child will do in mathematics later in school?), and two items measured beliefs concerning the student's literacy abilities (How well do you think your child is doing in literacy? How well do you think your child will do in literacy later in school?). Both parents, separately, answered the questions using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = \"poorly\", 5 = \"very well\").

All analyses were performed using the Mplus statistical package version 7.0 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998 -2010 . The model parameters were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimator with robust standard errors and chi-square (MLR), which is a robust method of estimating the parameters in the case of non-normal distribution. The fullinformation maximum likelihood procedure (FIML) was used to estimate missing data. Standard errors were corrected using the TYPE = COMPLEX function of Mplus, which takes the nested structure of the data (i.e., students nested in classrooms) into account (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998 -2010 . The analyses were carried out using the following steps. First, a univariate latent change model was estimated for the interest and importance values separately within each domain (mathematics and literacy) to analyze changes in these values from grade 7 to grade 9. Second, a multivariate latent change model was estimated for each domain, including levels of and changes in both interest and importance values. Third, students' gender and achievement and mothers' and fathers' ability beliefs were included in the model as predictors of the levels of and changes in students' interest and importance values. Students' gender was considered as a predictor of achievement, mothers' and fathers' ability beliefs, as well as of level of and changes in students' interest and importance values. In the first step, all paths were included in the model. In further steps, all non-significant paths were excluded sequentially from the model. Figure 1 shows the final model for literacy, including only significant paths. Figure 2 shows the final model for mathematics.",

The results (see Figure 1) showed a positive and statistically significant relationship between the levels of mathematics interest and importance values: the higher the level of interest, the higher the level of importance. Furthermore, there was a positive and significant relationship between the changes in interest and importance value: the greater the increase in interest, the greater the increase in importance; the greater the decrease in interest, the greater the decrease in importance. Next, gender, previous level of achievement, and parental beliefs were added to the model as predictors. The results showed that mothers' beliefs concerning their children's ability in mathematics in grade 7 positively predicted the students' level of interest value in mathematics at grade 7: the stronger the mothers' beliefs, the higher the students' interest value in math in grade 7. Prior mathematics achievement, in turn, predicted students' level of importance value in mathematics in grade 7: the higher the mathematics achievement, the higher the students' importance value in math in grade 7. Fathers' child-specific ability beliefs in grade 7 did not predict the level of mathematics interest and importance values. However, fathers' ability beliefs positively predicted the change in both students' mathematics interest and importance values: the stronger the father's child-specific ability beliefs in mathematics, the less students' mathematics interest and importance values decreased across school years. In addition, prior mathematics achievement positively predicted students' change in interest value: the higher the mathematics achievement, the less decrease in interest value occurred. Finally, gender did not predict mothers' or fathers' child-specific ability beliefs, but it had a negative effect on achievement and a positive effect on the change in importance values: boys showed a lower level of achievement in mathematics but the importance value attached to mathematics, however, decreased less among boys than among girls from grade 7 to grade 9.

The results showed, first, that at the mean level, the importance attached to mathematics decreased, but no change occurred in importance in literacy or interest values . Second, the interest and importance values and their development in one particular subject were associated with each other. Mothers' and fathers' beliefs seemed to play a different role in relation to task values, and this role also varied according to the subject. In line with our expectations, only mothers' ability beliefs predicted students' level of interest in mathematics and the level of importance of literacy.

Our results showed that, first, at the mean level, no significant change occurred in the interest value attached to either mathematics or literacy. In the case of reading, our results are in line with our hypotheses and some previous findings showing that interest value regarding literacy is stable during early adolescence. The result for mathematics, however, contradicted our expectations (Hypothesis 1) and the results of prior research, which demonstrated a decline throughout high school in students' interest in mathematics (Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Frenzel et al., 2010) . One reason for this contradictory finding might be the distinct characteristics of the Finnish school system: Finnish children remain in comprehensive school from grade 1 until grade 9. Only after grade 9 does a transition to secondary education (either upper secondary school or vocational school) occur, whereas in the US and Australia the transition from elementary school to junior high school occurs after either fifth or sixth grade. Such a change in the learning environment is often seen as the precursor of a strong decline in students' values, as it often does not meet the needs of adolescent students Eccles & Roeser, 2009) . In Finland, this transition happens later in students' school career, and this may be a reason for not finding a decline in interest value in mathematics and literacy in this study.",

It is possible that during this phase of schooling Finnish adolescents are starting to plan their future education and evaluating the skills that are needed in their planned educational path. It might be that some students believe that they do not need mathematics in their future education, and therefore the importance value attached to mathematics declines. It is possible that the nature of literacy as a school subject is seen as different from the nature of mathematics: literacy skills might be viewed as more general skills that are needed in a broader set of educational fields, which may affect students' evaluation of the importance of literacy and make the importance value of literacy more stable than the importance value of mathematics.",

The results showed, first, that mothers' beliefs about their children's abilities positively predicted the level of the students' interest value in mathematics and the level of importance of literacy in grade 7. Mothers' beliefs did not, however, predict changes in either value in either subject. Second, in line with previous results (Parsons et al., 1982) , fathers' ability beliefs did not play a role in students' levels of importance or interest values, but they did predict the changes in mathematics-related interest and importance values. The findings that mothers' beliefs play a role in the level of values and fathers' beliefs are important to the development of values is interesting. One possible explanation is that mothers are already involved with their children's schooling during the early school years and, therefore, have an effect on the level of values in grade 7. It is possible that fathers become more involved between grades 7 and 9 since this is an important time for students' planning of their future educational career. It might be that during this time fathers give more support to their children in schooling and future planning. It is also possible that fathers' beliefs could act as a protective factor against decreases in values: the stronger the fathers' beliefs concerning their children's mathematical abilities, the less decrease in interest and importance values occurred from grade 7 to grade 9.",

In literacy, mothers' beliefs positively predicted the level of importance value, but no other effects of parents' beliefs on students' values were found. It is possible that mathematics is seen as a more concrete and specific subject area, and therefore it is easier for parents to communicate their beliefs about children's abilities to their children in math than in literacy and, therefore, to affect the students' values. Another possibility is that literacy is, like English in English-speaking countries, a relatively highly gender-stereotyped subject (Forgasz & Leder, 1996) , seen as a subject for females rather than males. These gender effects might be so strong that it is difficult to find other affective factors influencing values. Our results actually did show strong gender effects on literacy values.",

In mathematics, boys reported a lower level of achievement, which is in line with the results of the 2012 PISA, which demonstrated that Finland is one of the few countries in which girls outperform boys in mathematics although the difference is not great: the average score for girls was 520 and for boys 517 (OECD, 2013). However, previous findings have also shown that, when measured with grades, instead of performance tests, as was done in the present study, girls typically outperform boys in mathematics (for a meta-analysis, see Voyer & Voyer, 2014) . The results of the present study also revealed that students' gender was not significantly related to the level of and change in interest in mathematics for students in grades 7 to 9 in this study or to the level of importance they attributed to it, but a more positive trend in the development of importance value was found among boys than in girls. This might indicate that during this time period, before the decision to continue in academic or vocational secondary education, students start to think about the demands of their future educational and occupational career. Since there is evidence for gendered participation rates in the workforce in some European countries (European Commission, 2009 , it is possible that, in the Finnish context, this is the time when these kinds of gendered attitudes relating to the importance of mathematics begin to form. It is important to note that during this period boys start to see mathematics as more important than girls do, because these attitudes might affect students' long-term educational and occupational plans.",

Moreover, the study was conducted in the context of the Finnish culture. However, there are some limitations that need to be discussed. First, the study tested only one direction of effects. It is possible that students' values also have an impact on their parents' beliefs (Eccles, Freedman-Doan, Frome, Jacobs, & Yoon, 2000; Yoon et al., 1993) . It is also possible that parents' beliefs explain gender differences in values, which was not tested in the present study. Second, we included only parents' beliefs in this model; parental activities with their children (Jacobs & Bleeker, 2004 ) may be more influential on students' interest or task value in mathematics than parents' expectations of ability. For example, it is possible that concrete activities, such as helping with school tasks or supporting a math-or literacy-related hobby has more impact on adolescents' task values than parents' beliefs, which may not be communicated very clearly to adolescents. Finally, in the present study, we examined the development of task values over a period of two years only. In order to better understand the developmental dynamics of values and the role of parental beliefs, it is important to broaden the time span in future studies.",
