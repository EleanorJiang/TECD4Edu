Korean high school girls' (N \u03ed 375) perceptions of the performance goal structures in the environment increased significantly throughout the school year. The girls' personal achievement goals and task value demonstrated few significant within-grade changes, but their selfefficacy fluctuated significantly around examinations. Motivational beliefs were more stable than were perceptions of the environment. Nevertheless, the modified perceptions of the learning environment explained changes in motivation, justifying continued efforts to create a motivationally adaptive environment.

In particular, many researchers have studied the effects of perceived classroom environments within an achievement goal orientation framework. Achievement goal orientations refer to the reasons and purposes for engaging in achievement-related behaviors in particular settings (Ames, 1992; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Nicholls, 1984; Urdan & Maehr, 1995) . When students pursue mastery goals, their primary purpose of engaging in academic activities is to develop their competencies. Mastery-oriented students welcome challenge and view occasional failures as a natural part of learning. In contrast, when students pursue performance goals, their main concern is how they are evaluated against their peers. Students with performance-approach goals strive to document their superior abilities, whereas those with performance-avoid goals seek to conceal their relative incompetence (Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996; Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Skaalvik, 1997) .",

Students perceive mastery goal structures in classrooms in which task mastery and effort investment are valued and understanding of the material is emphasized over test scores. Within such contexts, students more likely adopt mastery achievement goals for themselves. Perceptions of classroom mastery goal structures also increase students' self-efficacy, positive affect, and use of effective learning strategies (Ames & Archer, 1988; Midgley et al., 1995; Ryan & Patrick, 2001; Wolters, 2004) . When teachers instead focus on evaluation, promote competition among students, and reward only the highest scorers, students perceive performance goal structures and tend to pursue performance-oriented achievement goals in those settings. Perceptions of classroom performance goal structures often encourage maladaptive motivational behaviors among students, such as avoidance of help seeking and use of selfhandicapping strategies (Midgley & Urdan, 2001; Ryan, Gheen, & Midgley, 1998; Turner et al., 2002; Urdan, Midgley, & Anderman, 1998) .",

To date, significant changes in perceived learning environments and associated changes in personal motivation have been most clearly demonstrated in transition studies, in which students' perceptions of the environment were assessed before and after students' transition to middle school (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Harter, Whitesell, & Kowalski, 1992; Urdan & Midgley, 2003) . When transition is not involved, investigators typically assess students' impression of the environment once within each school year over several grade levels. As a result, it is unclear whether students' perceptions of the environment change to any appreciable degree within the same grade level. The question also remains as to whether the changes in students' perceptions of the environment between grade levels reflect primarily their reactions to classroom-specific episodes that took place within the school year or factors related to grade-level changes per se, such as more demanding curricula.",

Changes in students' personal achievement goals strongly imply analogous changes in their perceptions of the learning environment. That these changes occurred within the school year also increases the possibility that students adjust their perceptions and motivation largely as a result of regular classroom experiences. For example, major testing events are most likely to alter students' perceptions of their classroom environment, depending on how students are evaluated and test results communicated (Ames, 1992) . If the emphasis is on individual progress and effort, it will augment students' perceptions of classroom mastery goal structures. In contrast, if teachers make social comparative aspects of the evaluation salient, students' perceptions of performance goal structures in the classroom will be strengthened.",

Despite such recognition, the author was not aware of any study that has actually compared students' perceptions of their learning environment before and after major examinations within a single academic year. Also, the impact of the change, if any, in students' perceptions of the classroom goal structures within the school year on their motivation and performance has not been investigated. It is possible that students gradually grow numb to the presses they experience in their day-to-day schooling as they become more familiar with their classroom culture. Alternatively, the perceived environment could become increasingly more consequential as students come to realize more clearly what is expected of them. Students' reactions may also differ depending on their achievement level or the particular subject domain under consideration.",

Several investigators demonstrated a long-term impact of the learning environment on student motivation by linking measures of the early environment to later motivation, while controlling for measures of prior motivation (e.g., Anderman et al., 2001; Ryan & Patrick, 2001) . Although this provides a more conservative test of predictive relations, it still does not take into account the possibility that students' impression of the environment might have changed considerably over the course of the school year. By assessing both students' perceptions of the classroom goal structures and their personal motivation at multiple time points within the school year, it becomes possible to examine whether the changes in the perceived environment continue to exhibit significant relations with the changes in student motivation. It also enables researchers to explore how stable students' classroom perceptions are, whether certain perceptions change more dramatically than others, and whether the nature of relations between students' classroom perceptions and students' personal motivation remains consistent over time.",

These coefficients are generally lower than are those for personal achievement goals during the same period (Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Urdan & Midgley, 2003) . Students' perceptions of classroom goal structures were presumed to change less within the same academic year than either across transition or between grade levels. Nevertheless, they were still hypothesized to be less stable than students' personal achievement goals during the school year for several reasons. First, personal achievement goal orientations in specific domains typically demonstrate strong to moderate stability coefficients over varying periods (Conroy, Elliot, & Hofer, 2003; Meece & Miller, 2001; Wolters, Yu, & Pintrich, 1996) . Second, whereas stable individual difference variables such as achievement motivation (Harackiewicz, Barron, Carter, Lehto, & Elliot, 1997; Harackiewicz, Barron, Tauer, & Elliot, 2002) and theories of intelligence (Dweck, 1989; Dweck & Leggett, 1988) are part of the known determinants of personal achievement goals, effects of these variables on students' perceptions of the environment are likely to be weaker. Third, evaluative feedback from the teachers would alter students' perceptions of the classroom goal structures more than it would students' personal achievement goal orientations.",

There is also reason to suspect that the relations between students' perceptions of the environment and their motivation might fluctuate by the specificity of the context. Urdan and Midgley (2003) found that increased perceptions of the performance goal structures were associated with heightened personal performance goals at the general school level.

From a practical standpoint, the same evidence, or a lack thereof, should help determine the applicability of instructional implications derived from a particular subject area to other academic domains. To examine consistency of motivational relations across contexts, students' perceptions of the learning environment and their personal motivation were assessed in reference to general school learning as well as multiple subject domains in the present study. Fairly consistent relations were hypothesized across specific subject domains, whereas the relations were expected to differ somewhat at the general school level. On the basis of Urdan and Midgley's (2003) finding, relations between students' perceptions of the performance goal structures and students' personal performance-approach and performance-avoid goals were hypothesized to be stronger in the context of general school learning than within specific subject classes. Pomerantz, Altermatt, and Saxon (2002) reported that girls in Grades 4 -6 were more prone to experience negative selfevaluation, anxiety, and depressive symptoms than were boys, despite their superior academic achievement. The researchers suspected that girls are more concerned about pleasing adults and view evaluative feedback as more diagnostic of their abilities compared with boys, which made them more vulnerable to internal distress. Their findings have direct implications for the present research, which considers the motivation of high school girls. If girls worry about disappointing their parents and teachers by performing poorly, and this apprehension functions as a source for increased motivation as Pomerantz et al. speculated, it is possible that the relationships between girls' perceptions of the environment and their motivation diverge from the conventional pattern. For example, perceived performance goal structures in the learning environment might enhance, rather than depress, girls' selfefficacy and mastery goal orientations.",

Researchers documented the maladaptive motivational responses of low-expectancy students to failure (Dweck & Leggett, 1988) . Low-achieving girls, in particular, appear to suffer from negative ability attributions, higher internal distress, and performance deterioration upon failure than do high-achieving girls (Eccles [Parsons] , Adler, & Meece, 1984; Pomerantz et al., 2002) . Two hypotheses were generated on the basis of these findings. First, self-efficacy beliefs of low-achieving girls would likely be less stable compared with those of high-achieving girls. Second, low-achieving girls, compared with their higher achieving peers, would react more negatively to the perceived emphases on grades and social comparison in their learning environment. This latter hypothesis was only tentative because some argue that gifted, not low-achieving, girls tend to display motivational problems under highly competitive situations (Dai, 2002) .",

According to the goal theorists, achievement goals create a framework through which individuals interpret situations and process performance information (Duda & Nicholls, 1992; Dweck & Leggett, 1988) . Identical success and failure experiences connote disparate ability implications for individuals with different achievement goals and bring about unequal changes in their self-efficacy. However, it is equally viable that changes in achievement goals after evaluative feedback necessarily involve changes in self-efficacy beliefs. Only after students reach some conclusions regarding their competence at given tasks could they decide whether and how to approach or avoid them.",

When their self-efficacy was high, performance-oriented children's behaviors were similar to those of learning goal-oriented children. In addition, conceptualizing self-efficacy primarily as an outcome variable is not entirely consistent with the key tenet of the self-efficacy theory, which claims that self-efficacy is a predictive construct of individuals' upcoming motivation, affect, and behavior (Bandura, 1977 (Bandura, , 1997 .

By this time, participants were presumed to have accumulated enough experience to form an impression of the goal structures in each learning context. Students took their first-semester final exams in early July, scores on which composed the T1 achievement indexes. Students reported their postexam self-efficacy 2 weeks later (Time 2 [T2]), which composed the T2 self-efficacy. Selfefficacy was assessed both before and after the exams so as not to miss any potential impact of the enactive mastery experiences on this highly contextspecific construct (Bandura, 1977 (Bandura, , 1997 . The same procedures were repeated during the second semester, with the motivation survey in mid-October (Time 3 [T3]), followed by the second-semester final exams in December and the postexam self-efficacy survey in February (Time 4 [T4]).

To test consistency of the construct relations across domains, an identical SEM model was replicated in all specific and general learning contexts. Goodness-of-fit indexes were examined to determine whether it successfully reproduced the observed data pattern in each domain. For testing whether changes in students' perceptions of the environment after performance feedback explained further changes in their personal motivation, the variance attributable to construct stability, prior achievement, and postexam self-efficacy was partialed out from the second-semester variables in this model.

Also, there was no significant difference in fit between the one-and two-factor models in general school learning at either T1 or T3, \u232c 2 \u03fd 3.84, ps \u03fe 05.

Corroborating these results, students' personal motivational beliefs as a whole were significantly more stable than were their perceptions of the performance focus in the environment. Middle school transition studies demonstrated that significant changes in the perceived classroom goal structures were usually accompanied by corresponding changes in students' personal motivation (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Urdan & Midgley, 2003) .

On one hand, the heightened self-efficacy beliefs after the achievement testing confirm the power of enactive mastery experiences as the most potent source of efficacy information.

Nonetheless, some of the findings contradict those from previous reports and require further explanation. The most conspicuous difference is the significant positive paths from students' perceptions of the mastery goal structures to their personal performance-approach and performance-avoid achievement goals. On the basis of the proposals that girls are more willing to please others (Pomerantz et al., 2002) and readily accept external evaluations as diagnostic of their abilities (Roberts, 1991) , it was suspected that the performance goal pressure in the environment might operate as a positive, rather than a negative, motivator for the present sample of Korean high school girls. Some evidence for this hypothesis was obtained in the positive paths between the perceived performance goal structures and personal mastery goals and self-efficacy. The girls' stronger desire to please significant adults might also explain the unexpected negative findings regarding the task mastery focus in the environment. As the girls perceived that their teachers emphasized learning and individual progress, they not only strived to accomplish the tasks but also struggled to document their superior abilities and avoid exposing their relative incompetence.",

Asian students in general show keen interest in and awareness of others' views and evaluations, which easily translate into heightened concerns about how they are received by others in the relevant social network (Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Oishi & Diener, 2001 ). More specifically, Kim and Park (2005) reported that for Korean adolescents, parental achievement pressure and a sense of indebtedness toward parents functioned as positive, not negative, predictors of their achievement motivation. Emotional and social support from parents and teachers and feelings of guilt are also important motivators for Korean students (Kim, Park, & Park, 2000) . Therefore, the Korean high school girls who felt that their teachers genuinely cared about their learning and improvement might have experienced a stronger desire to prove that they lived up to the teachers' expectations. When they failed to master the tasks successfully, they might have wished to hide their incapability from their teachers so as not to disappoint them. It is interesting that Miller, Green, Montalvo, Ravindran, & Nichols (1996) reported U.S. high school students' goals of pleasing the family and pleasing the teacher also correlated moderately with their performance goals but were unrelated to their learning goals. Their finding provides some credibility to the present interpretation of the positive relationships between perceived mastery goal structures in the environment and personal performance-oriented goals.",

This finding contrasts with the path from the girls' reinforced perceptions of the relative ability focus in the environment to their increased self-efficacy, evinced only among those in the higher ability-track classes in English. Wolters (2004) observed a similar trend with U.S. junior high school students when the students in math classrooms with higher average performance goal structures reported higher self-efficacy. Also, there is a hint that students with disparate achievement histories may construe and react to the same mastery and ability messages in their classrooms in different ways (see, e.g., Urdan & Midgley, 2003) . It is uncertain, however, whether these achievement-level differences apply to other learning contexts, because findings were not consistent across the two subject domains. Also, the track and teacher effects could not be separated because there was only one teacher per track within each subject area. Future research should test whether the different motivational relations obtained in this study largely represent achievement-level differences or subject domain characteristics.",

Self-efficacy beliefs of the high school girls after they received feedback on their first-semester final exam performance predicted their subsequent self-efficacy and mastery goal orientations at the start of the second semester. These positive paths emerged consistently in the contexts of general school learning and all specific subject classes. Students' postexam self-efficacy also negatively predicted their performance-avoid goal orientations at the beginning of the second semester in all learning contexts but Korean. In contrast, earlier achievement goal orientations could not predict later self-efficacy beliefs to a comparable degree. The end-of-semester exam performance predicted mastery goals in English and math and performance-avoid goals in general school learning, but these postexam achievement goals did not predict subsequent achievement or self-efficacy. The only recurrent paths between earlier achievement goals and later self-efficacy involved performance-approach goals. Stronger performance-approach goals predicted higher self-efficacy in the contexts of general school learning and math classes.

In all specific and general academic domains, postexam self-efficacy mediated the effects of preexam self-efficacy on subsequent achievement goals and self-efficacy. Postexam selfefficacy also mediated the effects of exam performance (in English), prior performance-approach goals (in general school learning and math), or prior mastery goals (in math) on subsequent achievement goals and self-efficacy.

The discrepancy could be due to a number of factors. First, the college-student studies looked at the mediation of goal effects on subsequent interest and performance and not on subsequent goals and selfefficacy as did the present study. Second, and more important, high school students and college students are believed to differ in the manner with which they interpret evaluative feedback, the impact such feedback has on their perceptions of own academic ability, and the centrality of perceived competence in their ensuing motivation. High school students likely take their exam results more seriously than would college students because test scores are an important factor that determines their course grades, which affect their chance of entering desired colleges and universities. Korean students may show especially strong reactions to this type of feedback, given the heavy societal pressure for tertiary education (Bong, 2003) . In general, adolescents' perceptions of competence, compared with those of college students, might change to a greater degree after evaluative feedback and trigger different achievement goals. This conjecture is speculative at this point because the performance-efficacy portion of the mediation cycle was not significant in most of the domains.",

One of the current debates in the achievement goal orientation research involves the adaptive nature of performance-approach goals. Researchers such as Dweck (1989) ; Nicholls (1984) , and Ames (1992) originally envisioned performance goal orientations as the opposite of mastery goals, representing the maladaptive end of the motivational continuum. Investigators have later verified that mastery goals are, by and large, a positive predictor of adaptive learning processes. However, to the disappointment of many researchers, mastery goals often failed to produce tangible learning outcomes. Performance goals, meanwhile, have been shown to be a nonnegative and even a positive predictor of test scores and course grades, especially among college populations. This prompted a separation between approach and avoid components of performance goals (Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996) .",

Bong (2001) found that performance-approach and performance-avoid goals of a different group of Korean high school students were strongly correlated to each other across four core subject domains.

Performance-approach goals were positively correlated with self-efficacy, task value, and mastery achievement goals, whereas performance-avoid goals exhibited mostly nonsignificant relations with the adaptive motivational beliefs. These findings were replicated in the present study.

Brophy (2004) discussed several reasons underlying this skepticism. Included among them was the greater likelihood that students who presently pursue performance-approach goals would switch to performance-avoid goals as the learning becomes more challenging and achievement turns unsatisfactory. In fact, the Korean high school girls who participated in this research reported extreme dissatisfaction with their academic achievement at the end of the first semester. More than 80% of the girls indicated that they were not satisfied with their grades in the three specific subject matter areas, and 91.3% also expressed dissatisfaction with their overall achievement (Bong, 2003) . The present results thus offer some insight into the way the immediate benefit of adopting performance-approach goals could cost students their positive motivation in the long run. Obviously, correlation does not necessarily imply causation, even with the longitudinal data. Nonetheless, if future research shows that strong performance-approach goals are indeed one of the precursors of performance-avoid goals, actively discouraging such goals right from the outset may be one way to foster unyielding motivation.",

Students adjusted their views of the environment over the course of normal classroom episodes. These changed contextual perceptions in turn explained the changes in students' motivation. Despite several findings that were deemed gender-specific, the ways students' perceptions of the environment related to their self-efficacy, personal achievement goal orientations, and exam performance were highly similar across a number of specific subject matter domains and general school learning. In particular, perceptions of mastery goal structures in the learning environment surfaced as consistent and continuing predictors of positive academic motivation. In sum, the present research contribute to the existing literature by dem-onstrating that continued efforts to create motivationally adaptive learning environments could still bear fruit, despite the relative rigidity in motivational beliefs of these older students and the negative overall trend in their perceptions of the environment.",

Longitudinal investigations spanning multiple school years are needed to more clearly demonstrate the impact of changed perceptions of the environment on students' ongoing motivation. Including younger students, such as those in elementary or middle school, will be helpful to delineate the changing point, if any, in the pattern of relations between perceptions of the learning environment, personal motivation, and academic performance. Second, only students' self-efficacy beliefs were measured before and after major achievement testing in this study. It is possible that achievement goals might also display a similar degree of context specificity to self-efficacy, given that short verbal instructions or success manipulations on relatively simple tasks were able to induce intended achievement goals among the participants in many experiments. Repeated measurement of students' achievement goal orientations across important intervening classroom events will allow testing the tenability of this supposition. It will also allow more systematic tests of the hypothesized mediating role of self-efficacy beliefs between academic performance and resultant achievement goal orientations. Finally, some of the present findings were attributed to gender and cultural differences. However, with no comparison group, the design of this study did not permit sound speculations on the gender-and culture-specific characteristics of the present sample or the nature of their influences in the findings. The issues of gender and culture need to be explored further in future studies.",
