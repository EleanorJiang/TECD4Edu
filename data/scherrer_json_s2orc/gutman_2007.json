Changes occur as a result of puberty and cognitive development, school transitions, and changing roles with peers and families. These changes are often accompanied by shifts in adolescents' trajectories. For some adolescents, changes during this period can promote positive growth and adjustment. For other adolescents, however, these changes negatively affect self-esteem and mental health, as well as increase the risk of involvement in a variety of problem behaviors (Bongers, Koot, Van der Ende, & Verhulst, 2004; Eccles & Midgely, 1989; Eccles et al., 1993; Hankin et al., 1998) . In this study, we focused on how family relations contribute to developmental trajectories from early to late adolescence and how these associations vary by gender and ethnicity.",

For example, although depression increases from the early teens to the mid-20s for both males and females (Kessler, Avenevoli, & Merikangas, 2001) , females show larger increases than males (Hankin et al., 1998) . Females also have lower self-esteem than males, with the greatest difference occurring in late adolescence (Kling, Hyde, Showers, & Buswell, 1999) . In contrast, males are more likely to show increases in their engagement in problem behaviors, such as acts of delinquency, than females (Bongers et al., 2004) , although delinquency peaks in early to middle adolescence and then declines in later adolescence for both sexes (Hirschi & Gottfredson, 1983 ). Because of the dearth of longitudinal studies with data from normative samples of both European American and African American adolescents, there is less documentation of ethnic differences in developmental trajectories from early to late adolescence.",

Some of these negative changes may result from a mismatch between the needs of developing adolescents and the opportunities afforded to them in their various social environments. According to stageenvironment fit theory (Eccles & Midgley, 1989; Eccles et al., 1993) , the unique transitional nature of adolescence results, in part, from the relation between changes in the developmental needs of adolescents and changes in the social contexts in which they live. Many of the developmental changes during adolescence precipitate strained relations within the family that are likely to undermine adolescents' mental health and behavioral outcomes (Eccles et al., 1993; Eccles, Lord, & Roeser, 1996) . According to a stage-environment fit perspective, adolescents whose environments change in developmentally regressive ways are more likely to experience difficulties. In contrast, adolescents whose social environments respond to their changing needs are more likely to experience positive outcomes. The work by Eccles and Midgley (Eccles & Midgley, 1989; Eccles et al., 1993) provides strong support for this hypothesis.",

Yet, several researchers have reported no gender differences in the effects of decision-making opportunities on adolescent outcomes (Goldstein, Davis-Kean, & Eccles, 2005; Herman et al., 1998) . However, a longitudinal study spanning from early adolescence to young adulthood found that youth decision making in early adolescence had different predictive relations to depression for males and females in young adulthood: More youth decision making was related to decreased depression for males but increased depression for females (Gutman & Sameroff, 2004) . This finding suggests that appropriate levels of decision-making opportunities in early adolescence may differ according to the adolescent's gender, and the effects of this difference may not exhibit itself until later in adulthood.",

For example, studies of high-risk African American youths have found that high levels of youth-involved decision making during early adolescence relate to poorer adjustment and achievement (Baldwin, Baldwin, & Cole, 1990; Gonzales, Cauce, Friedman, & Mason, 1996; Gutman, Sameroff, & Eccles, 2002) . Greater parental control over decision making during early adolescence may be more beneficial for poor African American youths primarily because it protects them from the high-risk environments and dangerous neighborhoods where poor families typically reside. Smetana, Campione-Barr, and Daddis (2004) found similar results in a sample of middle-class African American adolescents: A higher level of parental involvement in formal decision making during early adolescence was associated with better self-worth in early adolescence and less deviance in middle adolescence. In contrast, and as one would expect developmentally, an increased role of adolescents in decision making predicted less depression and better self-worth when controlling for background characteristics and earlier adjustment. Smetana et al. (2004) suggested that parental decision making is normative during early adolescence in African American middle-class families and may protect adolescents from the pervasive risks of racism and prejudice. Taken together, these findings suggest that, although the level of decision-making opportunities may differ in early adolescence between African American and European American adolescents, an increased role in family decision making from middle to late adolescence may predict optimal adjustment for both groups.",

Researchers, for example, have noted that emotional closeness and time spent with parents decrease (Larson, Richards, Moneta, Holmbeck, & Duckett, 1996; Steinberg, 1988) , whereas family conflict increases during the adolescent years (Laursen, Coy, & Collins, 1998; Paikoff & Brooks-Gunn, 1991; Smetana, 1989) . In accordance with stage-environment fit theory, such changes in family relations may result in a mismatch between the developing needs of adolescents and their family environment (Eccles et al., 1993) . Although adolescents desire more autonomous, symmetrical relationships with their parents, at the same time, they often require more emotional closeness to, and open communication with, their parents. Adolescents may also benefit from positive identification with their parents, thus allowing adolescents to use their upbringing as a springboard to explore their own identities. Parents, however, may respond to their adolescents' desire for autonomy by detaching themselves from their children's lives or by demonstrating increased hostility to prevent the emergence of problem behaviors. Each of these responses is likely to increase the mismatch between parents and adolescents, which, in turn, could lead to the documented difficulties found for many adolescents. Numerous studies support these theoretical postulations. Research has indicated that hostile parenting practices and family conflict predict increases in delinquent behavior, whereas parental involvement and warmth predict lower rates of delinquent behavior and fewer depressive symptoms during adolescence (e.g., Chassin, Pillow, Curran, Molina, & Barrera, 1993; Ge, Best, Conger, & Simons, 1996; Patterson, Reid, & Dishion, 1992; Scaramella, Conger, & Simons, 1999; Simons, Wu, Conger, & Lorenz, 1994) .",

There are fewer studies, however, examining trajectories of hostile, harsh parenting behaviors, such as yelling and being overly critical, during adolescence that may represent a greater breach in parent-adolescent relations beyond the normative amount of storm and stress.

Evidence has indicated that parent-adolescent relations have significant effects on the depression of girls but not of boys (Compton, Synder, Schrepferman, Bank, & Shortt, 2003; Gutman & Sameroff, 2004) . In contrast, studies examining the effects of parent-adolescent relationships have found no significant moderating effects of gender on delinquent behaviors (Compton et al., 2003; Dekovic, Buist, & Reitz, 2004; Goldstein et al., 2005) .

Some studies confirm this relation (e.g., Kim et al., 2003) , whereas others suggest that ethnic-cultural variations may moderate this association (Deater-Deckard & Dodge, 1997). However, very little research has examined the effects of family processes on the occurrence of both mental health and behavioral outcomes from early to late adolescence for both African American and European American youths.",

However, because many studies examined data only at one or two time points and across a limited period, there is less information documenting longitudinal change in family relations and developmental outcomes from early to late adolescence. Using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), we extend previous research by documenting age-related trends in both family relations and adolescent outcomes from ages 13 to 19 years. On the basis of previous research examining changes in family relations during adolescence (e.g., Eccles et al., 1993; Smetana, 1988 Smetana, , 1989 Smetana, , 2000 , we included indicators of autonomy and per-ceptions of family relationships in our measures of family relations. Autonomy was measured by the degree to which adolescents felt they had decision-making opportunities. Family relationships included both negative and positive dimensions: (a) adolescents' perceptions of negative family interactions measured by their parents' use of yelling, criticizing, and physical punishment, and (b) adolescents' positive identification with their parents defined by their perceptions of closeness to, respect for, and time spent with their parents.",

Many researchers have commented on the need for more studies examining normative developmental processes among well-functioning African American families (e.g., Graham, 1992; McLoyd, 1998) . Furthermore, much of the previous research on African American families has focused on those living in poverty, yet the findings are often compared to middle-class European American families. To address this research gap, data for this study came from a longitudinal study of European American and African American families from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. We predicted that gender and ethnic differences would emerge regarding the association between family relations and adolescent outcomes, yet similarities may also be evident. For example, we predicted that European Americans would have higher levels of decision-making opportunities than African American adolescents, but both groups would experience similar positive effects from increased decision-making opportunities (Smetana et al., 2004) . We also expected that negative family interactions would have similar effects on the mental health and delinquent problems of European American and African American adolescents (Gutman et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2003) . For gender differences, we expected that the associations between family relations and delinquent problems would be similar for boys and girls, but the contributions of family relations to depression would differ according to gender (Compton et al., 2003) .",

In Fall 1991, students were initially recruited to participate in a Comer and Cook school evaluation study through a letter that was sent home with each seventh grader in the county (Cook, Herman, Phillips, & Settersten, 2002) . Families who were interested in learning more about the study were asked to sign and return a form giving the study staff permission to contact them. Of the families, 1,700 agreed to be contacted about the study.

Otherwise, growth curve esti- mates could be influenced not only by within-individual change over time but also by any stable individual differences between those who stayed in the study and those who dropped out (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992, pp. 121-123) . HLM assumptions including homoskedasticity and normality of residuals were checked. There was no relation between the residuals and predictors, and the distribution was symmetric and unimodal. Significance tests were also conducted to determine whether a linear, rather than quadratic, growth curve model characterized patterns of change, using a multiple-parameter significance test for the regression coefficients of \u2424 2j .

In support, we found that European American adolescents reported more decision-making opportunities than African American adolescents in middle adolescence. Although there was a significant increase in decision-making opportunities from early to late adolescence for both African American and European American adolescents, both reported that, on average, decisions generally were made together with their parents rather than independently. This finding suggests that, although the developmental norm for the level of adolescent decision making in the family may differ according to ethnicity, both African American and European American parents provide similar increases in opportunities for decision making as adolescents mature, and decision making tends to involve parental input, even in late adolescence. Similar to previous studies (Laursen et al., 1998; Paikoff & Brooks-Gunn, 1991; Smetana, 1989) , negative family interactions, as well as positive identification with parents, were highest in early adolescence, highlighting the salience of family relations during this period. However, from early to middle adolescence, negative interactions remained fairly stable, as was the case for European Americans, or even decreased, as was the case for African Americans. Although negative interactions increased in late adolescence, they did not reach the previous levels reported in early adolescence. However, most adolescents also experienced a decline in positive identification from early to middle adolescence, which stabilized during late adolescence. This finding makes sense from a developmental perspective, as adolescents are in the process of forming their own identities separate from their parents and may spend more time away from home. Yet, it is important to note that adolescents, on average, had high levels of positive identification, indicating, as other scholars have found, that adolescents tend to report good relations with their parents (see Steinberg, 1990 , for a review).",

Yet, African American and European American male and female adolescents experienced similar trajectories in both measures of mental health, with increases in self-esteem and depression in middle adolescence and decreases in late adolescence. This suggests that, although there may be differences in mean levels according to gender and ethnicity, vulnerabilities to mental health problems may be evident for all groups at particular stages in adolescence.

Our results supported these predictions by demonstrating concurrent associations with self-esteem and depression. Adolescents who had more decision-making opportunities reported higher selfesteem than adolescents who had fewer decision-making opportunities. However, the relation between decision-making opportunities and depression varied according to the adolescent's ethnicity. In support of Smetana et al. (2004) , more decision-making opportunities were related to less depression from middle to late adolescence for African American adolescents. However, the opposite pattern was found for European American adolescents: More decision-making opportunities were related to more depression. This may be the result of the difference in the mean level of decision-making opportunities between European and African American adolescents. Given that European American adolescents had significantly higher levels of decision-making opportunities compared with African American adolescents in middle adolescence, then more decision-making opportunities from middle to late adolescence, even at the same rate as African Americans, decision-making opportunities may provide inappropriate levels of autonomy for European American adolescents. Decision-making opportunities may have a curvilinear relation with adolescent outcomes-either too much or too little autonomy may not be beneficial. Therefore, when considering stage-environment fit, both the amount and the relative level of change need to be considered when examining the effects of decision-making opportunities on adolescent outcomes.",

However, because the lagged effect of negative family interactions had detrimental effects on other adolescent outcomes examined in this study, and the effects were similar across both gender and ethnic groups, we cannot conclude that negative interactions in the family are a risk factor for some adolescents but not for others. Rather, as our data demonstrate, adolescents may respond differently to negative family interactions according to their gender and ethnicity.

                "text": "A number of limitations need to be noted. First and foremost, we focused our examination solely on family relations. As stated in the introduction, there are many other contexts of development, such as peers and school environments, that are important correlates of change during the adolescent period. Second, we based our investigation on adolescents' perceptions of family relations and their own reports of their mental health and delinquent behaviors. However, the purpose of this study was to examine how adolescents' perceptions of their environment fit with their developmental stage. Moreover, results of previous studies have indicated that the effects of parenting on adolescent outcomes are influenced by adolescents' perceptions of the particular parenting behaviors examined (e.g., Smetana & Daddis, 2002 ). Yet, parental perceptions do matter, and an interesting future study would be to examine how differences in parents and adolescents' perceptions of the family environment contribute to adolescent trajectories. Third, a few of our measures had lower reliabilities, and the items included were somewhat limited because of the constraint that requires exactly the same measures across waves. For example, decisionmaking opportunities consisted of a single item only. As evidence has indicated that the rate and effect of decision making on adolescent outcomes vary according to the type of decisions involved (Smetana et al., 2004) , different patterns may emerge when using differential measures of decision making and, thus, should be investigated in future studies. Fourth, we assumed that family relations predict adolescent outcomes. Yet, it is likely that family relations may change as a result of the adolescents themselves. For example, parents may give their adolescents more decision-making opportunities if adolescents appear to have more self-esteem and handle more responsibility. Although using the time-lagged procedure provides some assurance regarding directionality, a future study may wish to examine how adolescents' mental health and behaviors influence the nature of family relations across adolescence. Finally, there are some disadvantages to using a timelagged procedure. The time lags used in this study were quite large, thereby making these tests quite conservative. The method was also constrained by assuming that a prediction exists only from one wave to the next. Other studies examining the effects of earlier family relations may predict outcomes at a much later time. For example, decision-making opportunities in early adolescence have been found to predict greater depression for girls during young adulthood (Gutman & Sameroff, 2004) .",

Several important patterns emerged. First, decision making and positive identification had only concurrent associations with mental health outcomes, but they did not have any longitudinal effects. Second, negative interactions had both concurrent and longitudinal effects on mental health and delinquent problems, suggesting a transactional process involved between negative family interactions and adolescents' outcomes. Last, the contribution of family relations to the pathways of mental health varied according to gender and ethnicity, but there were no differences for delinquent behavior.",

By and large, our results indicate that developmentally appropriate family relations relate to positive developmental outcomes. However, the significance of the results depended on whether the analyses were concurrent versus longitudinal and on the specific outcome being assessed. More important, the meaning of \"developmentally appropriate\" differed according to the gender and ethnicity of the adolescents. For example, although European Americans had higher levels of decision-making opportunities in early adolescence than African Americans, increased decision-making opportunities related to increased depression for European American adolescents but related to decreased depression for African American adolescents. Therefore, when considering stage-environment fit theory, researchers should examine the definition of fit in light of the characteristics of the adolescents themselves, as well as the amount and level of change in their family environments.",
