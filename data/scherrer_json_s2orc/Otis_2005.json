From primary school to university, intrinsic motivation was found to lead to better school outcomes (e.g., persistence, creativity, and performance) than extrinsic motivation (Amabile & Gitomer, 1984; Goldberg & Cornell, 1998; Hardre & Reeve, 2003) . To date, studies on motivational changes have observed that students tend to be less intrinsically motivated and more extrinsically motivated as they progress through the grades, especially after a school transition (Eccles, Lord, & Buchanan, 1996) . Given the evidence so far and the potential negative outcomes associated with a motivational decline, a comprehensive assessment of change in motivation and its impact is warranted.",

To obtain a more complete analysis of change, we examined motivation according to the self-determination theory's (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 1985 , 2002 multidimensional perspective of motivation. Further, a latent approach, the true intraindividual change modeling technique (e.g., Steyer et al., 2000) , is used in order to identify changes occurring in each motivational form proposed by SDT among all three measurement occasions. Another contribution of the present study consists of examining the influence of actual changes in each motivational form on academic adjustment. In the sections below, past investigations on intraindividual motivational changes and their limits are first presented. Then, the theoretical framework (i.e., SDT) and the statistical technique used in the present study to overcome limits of past studies are described.",

Value beliefs, defined as the perceived importance and interest attached to subject areas, were found to decrease for math across 1st through 12th grade (Pajares & Graham, 1999) , and for math and sport during the transition to middle school (Fredericks & Eccles, 2002) .

For instance, Harter (1981) measured motivation with subscales made up of both an intrinsic and extrinsic pole (preference for challenge vs. preference for easy work, curiosityinterest vs. teacher approval, and independent mastery vs. dependence on teacher). In this cross-sectional study, involving students from 3rd through 9th grade, a linear trend was observed in which motivational orientation was at first very intrinsic in 3rd grade but became increasingly extrinsic with each grade level. However, the shift from intrinsic to extrinsic motivation needs to be interpreted carefully because Harter (1981) used a dichotomous measure of motivation that puts intrinsic and extrinsic motivation at the opposite ends of the same continuum. Finally, studies within the context of achievement goal orientations have found a decrease in personal task goals and an increase in personal extrinsic goals during the transition to middle school (E. M. Anderman, Maehr, & Midgley, 1999; L. H. Anderman & Anderman, 1999; Maehr & Anderman, 1993) .

Most researchers have treated a decline in motivation as a negative consequence that should be avoided because a low level of motivation has been negatively associated with a successful pursuit of studies. However, those researchers did not examine whether the actual decline in motivation was associated with specific consequences. We propose to examine educational consequences as a function of a discontinuity in intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. We feel that such a dynamic approach to motivation is closer to the reality of a school transition, which is an event that takes place in time.",

                "text": "In the present study, we propose to examine educational motivation from the perspective of SDT (Deci & Ryan, 1985 , 2002 . This theory possesses several characteristics that make it suitable to the study of change. First, it proposes a multidimensional conceptualization of motivation. Consistent with other motivational perspectives, SDT proposes a distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation refers to engaging in activities for their inherent satisfaction. When intrinsically motivated, individuals initiate an activity for no other reason than knowing they will experience pleasure while doing it. In contrast, extrinsic motivation refers to engaging in activities for instrumental reasons. Thus, the incentive to perform the activity in extrinsic motivation is separate from the activity, whereas the incentive is located in the activity itself for intrinsically motivated behaviors. However, SDT does not view extrinsic motivation as only nonautonomous and as antithetical of intrinsic motivation. In fact, SDT postulates the existence of three forms of extrinsic motivation reflecting different levels of self-determination. From lowest to highest levels of self-determination, the forms are external regulation, introjected regulation, and identified regulation. When externally regulated, individuals' behaviors are controlled by external sources. For example, students study because they want to get a good grade, gain recognition from their teachers, or avoid punishment from their parents. This form of regulation refers to the common definition of extrinsic motivation found in the literature. With introjected regulation, individuals have internalized the formerly external source of motivation but have not yet truly accepted it. In this case, students study because of self-imposed pressures, to avoid feelings of guilt, or to conserve their self-esteem. However, individuals behave because they feel they have to and not because they want to. Identified regulation develops when individuals have chosen to perform the activity after having estimated its value and personal importance. An example of an identified regulation is when students decide to study because they recognize that it has advantages for them. Only this last form of extrinsic motivation is truly self-determined because individuals have made the choice to regulate the behavior.",

According to SDT, motivational changes naturally occur through the internalization process, which refers to individuals' natural tendency to internalize and integrate the regulation of behaviors that are socially valued (i.e., schoolrelated behaviors), and initially depend on extrinsic incentives. The internalization process is viewed as an innate tendency serving to promote the development of self-determined motivation and, thus, facilitates optimal functioning. SDT also proposes that the social context can undermine self-determined motivation (and promote non-self-determined motivation) when it is not supporting individuals' fundamental needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

Furthermore, high school dropout students have been found to be less intrinsically motivated, less identified, and less introjected toward school than persistent students (Vallerand, Fortier, & Guay, 1997) .

The true change contains more information than the sum of the trend components. Indeed, a linear curve represents only an approximation of what occurs through the 3 years, and even if we add a quadratic (or cubic) component to the LGC model, it is difficult to examine (true) changes between 8th and 9th grade and between 9th and 10th grade, separately. Such a distinction could be important to make if we want to examine the transition from junior (8th grade) to senior (9th grade) high school.

In contrast, in LGC modeling, only the linear or higher components of change (quadratic, cubic, etc.) can be correlated with academic adjustment variables.

For this purpose, Grouzet, Otis, and Pelletier (in press ) have examined, in a previous article, the longitudinal factorial invariance of the AMS. They found strong evidences for metric invariance (i.e., invariance of the factorial loadings) across the three grade years (i.e., from 8th to 10th grade). Concerning scalar invariance (i.e., invariance of intercepts), comparative index statistics were satisfactory. Therefore, the AMS in its present form (i.e., five factors) showed a good level of 3-year factorial invariance.",

The baseline model can be examined in order to establish the true motivational change occurring between 8th and 9th grade (the transitional year) as well as between 8th and 10th grade. Changes during this last interval are important in order to obtain a picture of changes in motivation from junior high school to 1 year after the transitional year. Examination of longterm trajectories of motivation has been lacking in the school transition literature, and researchers have indicated the need to explore in more depth this period of adaptation (Hirsch, DuBois, & Brownell, 1993) . As for the neighbor model, it provides information on the true motivational change occurring between each successive measurement time. This additional model can also be examined so that changes in motivation between 9th and 10th grade are revealed. This period of change is of utmost importance to us because it represents inclusively the adaptation period, but it is also the period preceding students' legal age for dropping out from school.",

( , 2000 . when a motivational form correlates most highly with the motivational forms that are adjacent to it on the continuum of selfdetermination, less so with motivational forms that are farther on the continuum, and negatively with motivational forms that are the farthest on the continuum. For example, intrinsic motivation is anticipated to correlate positively and more strongly with identified regulation, less with introjected and external regulations, and negatively with amotivation. Also, we expect to replicate, for each grade, the previously observed relations between the different motivational forms and educational consequences. Correlations with educational adjustment (i.e., dropout intentions, absenteeism, homework frequency, and educational aspirations) are expected to be increasingly positive from external regulation to more selfdetermined motivational forms. Moreover, amotivation is proposed to negatively correlate with educational adjustment.",

In our study, 201 participants were absent from the 9th-grade wave of measurement, and 164 participants were absent from the 10th-grade wave of measurement. Therefore, use of listwise deletion would reduce the sample from 646 to 355 (i.e., a 45% reduction). However, listwise deletion yields unbiased parameter estimates only if the assumption that the missing data are missing completely at random holds and if the attrition rate is less than 5% (Schafer & Graham, 2002) . When the two assumptions are not valid, listwise deletion of missing data generates biased estimates (Graham, Cumsille, & Elek-Fisk, 2003 ; R. J. A. Little & Rubin, 1987; Schafer & Graham, 2002) . To counter the problems associated with listwise deletion and make use of all the data, we used the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for covariance matrices. The EM algorithm offers several advantages over listwise deletion. Unlike listwise deletion, if the data are missing at random, the EM algorithm estimates are unbiased (Schafer & Graham, 2002) . Finally, if the missing data are considered nonignorable missing, all missing data strategies yield biased estimates. However, EM algorithm estimates are the least biased (Schafer, 1997; Schafer & Graham, 2002) .",

Analyses of changes in raw and latent means both revealed that intrinsic motivation and all forms of extrinsic motivation declined significantly over the transition to high school and further declined between the first and second year of high school.

Table 6 presents correlations between motivational forms, measured in 8th, 9th, and 10th grade, and educational adjustment, measured in 10th grade. The results for the global measure of educational adjustment were generally consistent with our expectations. Overall, better school adjustment was observed with the most self-determined forms of motivation whether measured prior to or after the senior high school transition. However, these relations were stronger for a smaller time lag between motivational assessment and educational adjustment assessment. Indeed, all forms of motivation in 9th and 10th grade were related to educational adjustment measured in 10th grade. It is interesting that in the 9th grade, intrinsic motivation and identified regulation were similarly associated with educational adjustment, but in 10th grade, identified regulation was more strongly associated with educational adjustment than intrinsic motivation. In 8th grade, the two most extreme motivational forms, that is, intrinsic motivation and amotivation, were the most related to educational adjustment measured 2 years later. This result is remarkable because the presence of the most autonomous form of motivation or the absence of motivation in the last year of primary school were indicators of educational adjustment 2 years into senior high school. In summary, intrinsic motivation and amotivation in the 8th grade were the main motivational forms that were related to educational adjustment in the 10th grade. Overall, all forms of motivation in the 9th and the 10th grade were related to educational adjustment in the 10th grade. A closer look at the specific adjustment consequences revealed some particularities. Regarding homework frequency, the role of external regulation was found to differ across grade. Indeed, external regulation in 8th grade was negatively related to homework frequency, but no relation was observed between external regulation in 9th and 10th grade and homework frequency. Absenteeism was mostly determined by intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, and amotivation. Moreover, similar to the global measure of academic adjustment, intrinsic motivation and amotivation in 8th grade were found to have the most influence on absenteeism, but intrinsic motivation and identified regulation in 9th and 10th grade had similar effects. Dropout intentions was the consequence more strongly predicted by the different forms of motivation. Notably, each form of motivation in 9th and 10th grade contributed significantly to the prediction of intentions to drop out. Inversely, educational aspirations was the consequence that had fewer significant relationships with the different forms of motivation. Among motivational forms in 8th grade, only amotivation was negatively associated with academic aspiration. Among motivational forms in 9th grade, identified regulation was also positively associated with academic aspiration. Finally, among motivational forms in 10th grade, amotivation (negative), intrinsic motivation, and identified regulation (positive) were equal predictors of academic aspiration, followed by external regulation (positive). An interesting trend we found was that, in 10th grade, homework frequency and dropout intentions associated the most with identified regulation, whereas absenteeism and educational aspirations associated the most with intrinsic motivation and identified regulation.",

First, we focused on the global measure of educational adjustment. For the period occurring from the end of junior high school to the first year of senior high school (i.e., the 8th-to 9th-grade change), we observed that a decrease 3 in external and identified regulation was associated with less long-term educational adjustment, whereas a decrease in amotivation was associated with increased long-term educational adjustment. Looking separately at the various consequences composing the global measure of educational adjustment, we noticed that dropout intentions explained by itself the relation between changes in identified regulation and educational adjustment. Thus, by omitting the dropout consequences, we can conclude that a decrease in non-self-determined motivation, especially external regulation, during the following year of the transition is associated with less long-term educational adjustment. Surprisingly, during the subsequent year (i.e., the 9th-to 10thgrade change), change in external regulation was not related to educational adjustment. For the period extending from the first year to the second year of high school, a decrease in identified regulation was found to be the most important negative correlate of educational adjustment. Also, educational adjustment was negatively associated with a decrease in intrinsic motivation and with introjected regulation and positively associated with a decrease in amotivation. Results for the 2-year period (i.e., 8th to 10th grade) reflected an integration of the 8th-to 9th-grade and the 9th-to 10th-grade results. In the 8th-to 10th-grade period, the type of motivational change the most strongly associated with both the global and specific measures of educational adjustment was identified regulation.",

The results of the present study extended prior research by revealing the pattern of change for different forms of extrinsic motivation and for amotivation. The pattern of change for all self-determined and non-self-determined forms of extrinsic motivation was marked by a steady decline. Amotivation slightly increased during the transitional year but then slightly decreased during the second year in senior high school, which explains why levels of amotivation in 8th and 10th grade were not significantly different. Thus, our results suggest that students, as a group, are generally less motivated toward school as they move from junior to senior high school. It seems that every reason students have for going to school becomes less important when they enter senior high school and even less important in their second year into senior high school. Indeed, senior high school students generally become highly invested in social activities and in sport activities and attach more importance to these nonacademic activities compared with academic activities (Wigfield & Eccles, 1994) . In sum, the use of a multidimensional measure of motivation showed a different picture of students' motivational trajectory during the senior high school transition. The present results suggest that students experience a decrease in both intrinsic and selfdetermined and non-self-determined forms of extrinsic motivation in senior high school, whereas past results reported that students become more extrinsically motivated and less intrinsically motivated to go to school.",

More specifically, ordered correlations were found among the motivational forms, where conceptually similar motivational forms correlated more highly with each other than the more differentiated motivational forms. According to Ryan and Connell (1989) , the simplex pattern provides support to the SDT's postulate that the different forms of motivation differ in terms of degree, are interconnected, and are organized along a continuum of selfdetermination. In this study, the observed correlations among the motivational forms in 8th, 9th, and 10th grades were generally consistent with a simplex pattern, but some departures were observed. The most important departure was that identified and external regulations were more strongly correlated with each other than they were with more conceptually similar motivational forms.",

In this study, both identified and external regulations were positively associated with educational adjustment. A closer look at the items for identified and external regulation revealed a possible explanation for the overlap between these two concepts and their similar consequences. Even though the items for identified regulation reflected more self-determined reasons to go to school (\"to have a job I will personally like\") than external regulation (\"to have a job that will pay well\"), items of both motivational forms communicate the idea that school is instrumental to one's future goal.

On the basis that a student possesses each motivational form to a certain degree, support for the simplex pattern among the motivational changes would mean, for example, that an increase in a student's intrinsic motivation (a selfdetermined form of motivation) is associated more positively with an increase in his or her identified regulation (a self-determined form of motivation), less with an increase in his or her introjected and external regulations (non-self-determined forms of motivation), and negatively with an increase in his or her amotivation (lack of self-determination). Our findings supported the majority of these proposed relations. We found that a change (i.e., increase or decrease) in a motivational form tended to be more strongly associated with a change in the same direction for adjacent motivations, less associated with a change in distant motivations, but associated with a change in the opposite direction for the more distant motivation. The observed violations to the simplex pattern for the motivational changes were almost identical to those for the motivational forms. Thus, this study has observed for the first time that the relations among the motivational changes were similar to the relations among the motivational forms. In sum, our results seem to indicate that changes in motivation do not occur in isolation.

According to SDT, intrinsic motivation is the most self-determined form of motivation and it should lead to the highest levels of educational adjustment. However, there is also evidence that shows that identified regulation is particularly important in the school context. For example, Koestner and Losier (2002) proposed that identified regulation ensures the execution of important behaviors that are not interesting. School activities certainly fit in that category of behaviors; they are often perceived as not interesting compared with other leisure activities. In the education context, Koestner and Losier found that identified regulation determined academic satisfaction in college and persistence in college at an 18-month follow-up, whereas intrinsic motivation or introjected regulation were nonsignificant predictors.",

Absenteeism and educational aspirations were found to be equally related to intrinsic motivation and identified regulation. Homework frequency and dropout intentions were more related to identified regulation than to intrinsic motivation. Because doing homework is less likely to be perceived as fun and dropping out of school does not mainly derive from not liking school, this may be why these consequences were more related to the extent students attached importance to school. However, consequences such as attending school and choosing to pursue one's education are more likely to depend on liking school as much as (whether to see friends, for sports, or for learning about subjects that interest them) on finding school important.",

Thus, each motivational form contributed to students' intentions to stay in school, and, as a whole, it suggests that students have no intentions to drop out if they have one form of motivation (whatever that form may be) that keeps them motivated to stay in school. Whereas selfdetermined motivations may better prevent students from dropping out, non-self-determined motivations may be associated with other types of incentives to continue school.

Together, these results show that it is not students' low level of external regulation in the 8th or the 9th grade that is associated with more risk but rather a drop in their level of external regulation between the 8th and the 9th grade. Thus, teachers should be particularly attentive to students who experience a decrease in their motivation, in addition to students who maintain the same low level of motivation.",

So, even if external and introjected regulations were positively associated with educational consequences, an increase in these forms of motivation was not associated with more adjustment. Interventions should then focus on promoting self-determined motivation, as advised by SDT.

Future studies should include measures assessing the consequence of a drop in motivation immediately following the transition. Short-term consequences and long-term consequences associated with a decrease in motivation could then be compared. Second, our results relied on self-report measures. Although past research has shown that dropout intentions represent reliable predictors of actual dropout (Vallerand et al., 1997) , it may be important to examine the role played by true motivational changes in the prediction of real dropout. Third, changes due to the school transition and to developmental factors are potentially confounded in this study. Future studies could assess motivational changes among students making the school transition at different grade levels. For example, students making the transition from the 8th to the 9th grade while remaining in the same school could be compared with students making the same transition but moving to a new school. Finally, our results suggest that the different forms of motivation may fluctuate over time. However, they do not suggest anything about the source of those fluctuations. We feel that it could be important to examine this issue in future studies. More specifically, as suggested by SDT, it would be important to examine whether the changes in the different forms of motivation result from the support of autonomy and competence experienced at home and in the classroom. It could then be possible to determine more precisely the origin of the motivational changes that occur and when those changes occur.",
