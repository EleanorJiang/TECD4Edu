                "text": "A prominent construct in current theoretical models of motivation is the achievement goal (Wigfield, Eccles, Schiefele, Roeser, & Davis-Kean, 2006) . Research using an achievement-goal framework has flourished in recent years. Extant work has primarily focused on the relation of achievement goals to a variety of educationally relevant outcomes and the influence of different instructional contexts on achievement goals (Wigfield et al., 2006) . There has been little longitudinal research on achievement goals. Thus, our understanding of how achievement goals change across time and the implications for students' achievement across time is incomplete. Therefore, in this article, we examine the developmental processes of achievement goals and achievement with a longitudinal research design and growth-curve analytic techniques that incorporate changes in the predictor variables (i.e., achievement goals) as well as the outcome variable (i.e., achievement). We begin with an overview of theory and research on the achievement-goal construct, highlighting why a longitudinal analytical approach is appropriate and will advance understanding of the nature of achievement goals and the consequences of achievement goals for achievement. We then discuss our approach and rationale for the three key questions that guide our longitudinal investigation: (a) What is the nature of the development of achievement goals? (b) Does the association between achievement goals and achievement change across time? and (c) Do changes in achievement goals have implications for changes in achievement?",

                "text": "Achievement goals represent different orientations toward academic competence that students often have in achievement settings (see Elliot, 2005 , for a review). Researchers have distinguished between a mastery goal (a focus on developing academic competence) and performance goals (a focus on demonstrating academic competence to others, especially via social comparisons of relative ability; e.g., Ames & Archer, 1988; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Harackiewicz & Elliot, 1993; Nicholls, 1989) . Researchers have found it is important to distinguish performance goals as approach oriented or avoidant oriented (Elliot & Church, 1997; Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Skaalvik, 1997) . A performance-approach goal concerns a focus on demonstrating high competence and gaining positive judgments from others. A performance-avoidance goal concerns a focus on avoiding the demonstration of incompetence and preventing negative judgments from others. For example, a student with a mastery goal might reflect on such questions as \"Am I learning? Have I improved my skills?\"; a student with a performance-approach goal might reflect on such questions as \"Do I look smart? Did I do better than others?\"; and a student with a performance-avoidance goal might reflect on such questions as \"Do I look dumb? Did I perform worse than others?\" Different goals set in motion disparate cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes (Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Elliot, 2005) . Achievement goals are viewed as a proximal influence on competence-relevant processes and outcomes; they are a precursor to behavior (i.e., why a student does something precedes whether, if, and how they actually do it; Elliot & Church, 1997) . Personality or dispositional factors are postulated to partially explain individual differences in achievement goals (e.g., Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Elliot, 1999; Harackiewicz, Barron, & Elliot, 1998) . However, theorists describe achievement goals as fluctuating in relation to different experiences in learning environments (Ames, 1992; Maehr & Midgley, 1996) . Experimental work has been successful in orienting students to pursue different achievement goals (e.g., Butler, 1993; Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996; Newman & Schwager, 1995) . Observational work that links classroom experiences to personal goals is also evidence for this viewpoint (Linnenbrink, 2005; Patrick, Anderman, & Ryan, 2002; . Thus, achievement goals are conceptualized as dynamic and changing in relation to features of the context.",

Prior longitudinal research examining the development of achievement goals during early adolescence (i.e., goals as outcomes) has assessed achievement goals at two time points and found that a mastery goal declines and a performance-approach goal increases across the transition to middle school (E. M. L. H. Anderman & Anderman, 1999) . 1 However, analyzing change across two time points provides a limited understanding of the development of achievement goals. At least three time points are needed to document a trend (Rogosa, 1988) . Further, these studies have assessed achievement goals at one point in different grades, and thus, within-and between-school-year changes have not been disentangled. Changes in motivation over time within the same classroom environment may be different from changes that occur as students move into new classrooms or school environments. Such information is particularly important regarding the transition to middle school, given the long-standing concerns that middlelevel schools are a major source of declines in motivation during early adolescence (see Eccles, Lord, Roeser, Barber, & Jozefowicz, 1997; Juvonen, Le, Kaganoff, Augustine, & Constant, 2004) . Are there normative declines in achievement goals in progress prior to the transition? Are declines in achievement goals seen in the beginning of the middle-school year, or do they unfold during the first year in middle school? The present study addresses such unanswered questions and provides a more complete understanding of the nature of change in goals during early adolescence by estimating growth trajectories across four time points (data were collected in 6-month increments in the fall and spring of both sixth and seventh grades, spanning the transition to middle school). We examine the overall trend in development across the four time points as well as investigate the within-and between-year patterns of change that contribute to any documented trends.",

Findings regarding gender differences in achievement goals are not entirely consistent, but when differences are found, girls tend to be more mastery oriented than boys (e.g., Ablard & Lipschultz, 1998; Freeman & Anderman, 2005; Kenney-Benson, Pomerantz, Ryan, & Patrick, 2005; Meece & Holt, 1993; Nolen, 1988) , and boys tend to be more performance oriented than girls (e.g., L. H. Anderman & Anderman, 1999; Middleton & Midgley, 2002; Roeser, Midgley, & Urdan, 1996; A. M. Ryan, Hicks, & Midgley, 1997; Stipek & Gralinski, 1996) . There has been far less research on race differences in achievement goals, but some research suggests that African American students may be higher in mastery (e.g., Kaplan & Maehr, 1999; Middleton & Midgley, 2002) as well as performance-approach and performanceavoidance goals (Middleton & Midgley, 2002) . However, given the limited longitudinal analyses of achievement goals, we do not know if gender and race relate to the development of goals across time or if the relation of gender and race to achievement goals changes across time. The relations of gender and race might differ when students are in elementary versus middle school, as both gender and ethnicity take on new significance. Gender and race differences may emerge or grow stronger as students cognitively mature and reflect on their identity in more complex ways during adolescence.",

The consequences of achievement goals may change as students mature and move through the educational system (see Midgley et al., 2001 ). Growth-curve models that treat achievement goals as time-varying predictors are well suited to examine the changes in the achievement goal-achievement relation. To examine the implications of achievement goals for subsequent student achievement, we incorporate the measurements of achievement goals at all four time points into our models for achievement and test whether the effects of goals on subsequent achievement are consistent over time. Because a performanceavoidance goal has consistently been found to be negatively associated with achievement, our focus is on the associations between mastery and performance-approach goals and achievement. When effects are found, a mastery goal is positively related to achievement for younger students (e.g., Kaplan & Maehr, 1999; Midgley & Urdan, 1995; Roeser et al., 1996; A. M. Ryan, Patrick, & Shim, 2005; Wentzel, 1993; Wolters, Yu, & Pintrich, 1996 ; but see also Pajares, Britner, & Valiante, 2000; Pajares & Valiante, 2001; Pintrich, 2000; Skaalvik, 1997 , for studies documenting no relation). 2 A mastery goal has consistently been found to have no association with achievement for college students (see Harackiewicz, Barron, Pintrich, et al., 2002 , for a review). A performance-approach goal has been found to have no association with achievement for younger students (e.g., Pajares et al., 2000; Pajares & Valiante, 2001 ; but see A. M. , for a study documenting a negative relation). However, a performanceapproach goal has consistently been found to have a positive association with achievement for college students (see Harackiewicz, Barron, Pintrich, et al., 2002 , for a review). As students advance through the educational system, the context becomes more competitive (e.g., grading on a curve), and a mastery goal may be less adaptive, whereas a performance-approach goal may be more adaptive for achievement. The transition to middle school represents such a change in context (see Eccles, 2005 , for a review), and thus, our longitudinal study spanning this transition is at an appropriate time to examine whether the association of achievement goals to achievement changes.",

Interindividual effects concern variations between students and document if high or low scores on an aspect of motivation, compared with other students, explain variation in engagement or achievement. Intraindividual effects concern the changes in individuals' motivation that occur across time and document if such within-individual fluctuations are important for changes in engagement or achievement. Our first two research questions concern interindividual analyses and identify general patterns across students (the first pertaining to the development of goals and the second pertaining to the associations of goals to achievement across time). However, we expect that there is variability in those general patterns between students. For example, we may document a general decline in mastery goals over time, but not all students will conform to this general pattern. Our third research question concerns intraindividual analyses and examines the implications for achievement of varying within-individual patterns of change in achievement goals. Examining intraindividual effects contributes to a more complete understanding of how motivational beliefs may support or hinder achievement across time.",

Such studies concluded that when a mastery goal declines, various aspects of engagement, as well as achievement, decline, and when a mastery goal increases, engagement and achievement increase. Another similar study examined change scores in students' perceptions of teacher encouragement of different achievement goals and found that when students' perceptions of their teacher emphasizing mastery goals declined from one year to the next, their engagement and achievement declined (Urdan & Midgley, 2003) . No effects for performance goals were found in any of these studies; however, performance-approach and performanceavoidance goals were not distinguished (Gehlbach, 2006; Urdan & Midgley, 2003) or not examined (Meece & Miller, 2001) .",

These analytic approaches examine the direction of change but do not incorporate the general level of achievement goals during the two time periods (e.g., in Urdan & Midgley's 2003 study, approximately three fifths of students were categorized as \"no-change,\" and within this group were students whose goal scores were high, medium, or low at both time points). In contrast, we use growth-curve models to capture both the level of achievement goals and the pattern of change within students across four time points. We include two predictors: students' achievement-goal scores at Time 1 (termed baseline score) and deviations from their Time 1 achievement-goal scores (termed DevT 1 score). A baseline score, the most typical predictor examined in longitudinal analyses indicates whether students' achievement goals at the beginning of the study predict the growth trajectory in achievement over time. The DevT 1 scores indicate whether gains and losses from Time 1 scores are also important. By including both predictors, we are able to ascertain whether changes in achievement goals, beyond students' initial levels of achievement goals, contribute to an understanding of students' achievement trajectories during early adolescence.",

This is appropriate to compare patterns between younger students in public schools and college students, as college students do not routinely take standardized tests, and thus, research on college students' achievement goals and achievement has examined grades as a measure of achievement. In addition, the present study uses grades as an indicator of student achievement, so it makes sense to focus the literature review in this way. Further, in our review of the relationship between achievement goals and achievement, we examine the zero-order correlations, not the unique effects of goals above and beyond other achievement-related variables in multiple regression models. These types of multiple regression models vary greatly across studies and include variables that may be mediators of the relationship between achievement goals and achievement, which is not the focus of the present study. (a) the normative patterns of development of achievement goals, (b) the potentially changing association of achievement goals and achievement over time, and (c) the implications of withinindividual changes in achievement goals (with attention to both direction of change and level of goals) for changes in achievement over time. Our longitudinal design includes four measurements of achievement goals in the fall and spring of sixth and seventh grades. Consistent with our conceptualization that achievement goals predict achievement, our four measurements of achievement (i.e., grade-point average [GPA] computed from report card grades) were collected at the end of the corresponding semesters and thus encompass achievement that extends beyond the measure of achievement goals. When we examined the associations of achievement goals to achievement across time, we controlled for prior achievement (i.e., fifth-grade GPA) because relations between achievement goals and achievement are reciprocal and we wanted to examine the effects of achievement goals on achievement above and beyond the contribution of prior achievement history (see Brophy, 2005; Senko & Harackiewicz, 2005 , for a discussion of these issues).",

Sample instability was due to two factors: school participation and mobility rates. Regarding school participation, we lost some students who went to a nonparticipating middle school and gained some students from nonparticipating elementary schools (in total, three elementary schools and one middle school chose not to participate). After these students were accounted for, the sample instability was comparable with the mobility rates reported by the state for these schools. Because we were examining developmental changes over the middle-school transition, only those students who actually made the transition into middle school (i.e., had data for at least one time point in elementary school and at least one time point in middle school) were included in the analyses. Students who were not African American or European American were dropped because there were too few (n \u03ed 30) to examine ethnic differences. These restrictions yielded a sample of 588 students (56% girls, 44% boys; 60% African American, 40% European American).

In the current study, we control for prior GPA and use Time 1 achievement goals to calculate the deviation from Time 1 scores (DevT 1 ). Thus, we had four important Level 2 variables (fifth-grade GPA and three Time 1 achievement goals), and students who joined the study after Time 1 did not have these variables. To include the maximum number of students in the analyses, missing values for these Level 2 variables were imputed. A fundamental weakness of single value imputation techniques (e.g., mean substitution, person mean substitution, regression imputation) is the underestimation of standard errors, which affects Type I errors (Allison, 2002; Newman, 2003) . To avoid this problem, we employed a multiple imputation (MI) method to fill in the missing data. A strength of MI estimate is the decreased sensitivity to violations of multivariate normality (Allison, 2002) . In addition, the MI paradigm neither requires nor assumes that nonresponse is ignorable (Schafer, 1997) . MI has been used in HLM contexts (Dearing, Kreider, Simpkins, & Weiss, 2006) to deal with missing predictors at Level 2. In MI, a complete data set is created by filling in a random value for each missing data point. This procedure is repeated to create multiple complete data sets, each of which is subsequently analyzed.",

We conducted a series of t tests to examine changes in goals across different time points (see Table 3 for the results). The results have shown significant mean differences in all three achievement goals between Times 1 and 2 and between Times 3 and 4. There were no significant mean differences in any of the three achievement goals between Times 2 and 3. Thus, declines were more pronounced within, rather than between, school years. Declines within the school year occurred in both elementary and middle school. The declines that occurred between the end of elementary and the beginning of middle school were not significant, indicating that the middle-school transition was not the major contributing source to the overall pattern of decline found for achievement goals during early adolescence. Next, we examined whether gender and/or race explained variation in students' growth trajectories in achievement goals (see Table 4 for the results). We entered gender and race as Level 2 predictors in the growth-curve models to examine whether the initial levels (i.e., the intercept) and rates of change (i.e., the slope) of achievement goals are a function of these variables.

As recommended by Singer and Willett (2003) , we repeated the analyses three more times with time centered at each of the three subsequent time points so we could compare the associations of goals and achievement at different time points. For example, when time is recentered around Time 2, \u2425 20 indicates average association between a mastery goal and GPA at Time 2, whereas when time is recentered around Time 3, \u2425 20 indicates average association between a mastery goal and GPA at Time 3.

The initial levels of goals are Level 2 between-individual variables (termed baseline score, Time 1 Goal \u03ed Goal 1j ), and deviation scores from the initial levels are Level 1 within-individual predictors of achievement goals (termed DevT 1 scores, DevT 1 Goal \u03ed Goal ij -Goal 1j ). DevT 1 scores were computed by subtracting the Time 1 goal scores from goal scores at four time points, and thus, they represent the deviation at each time point from the initial baseline. The significant effects of DevT 1 scores indicate that the students' goal changes from their own initial baseline affect their growth trajectories of GPA.

The temporal sequence of our design (our measurements of achievement goals are at the beginning of the semester, and GPA represents achievement across the entire semester), as well as controlling for prior achievement, helped address reciprocal causation concerns but did not preclude the possibility that achievement influences subsequent achievement goals. Thus, we conducted HLM analyses to estimate the effect of prior achievement on growth trajectories of achievement goals (see Table 7 for the results). Previous semester GPA from spring of fifth grade to fall of seventh grade were entered as a time-varying predictor for growth trajectories of achievement goals from fall of sixth grade to spring of seventh grade. Prior achievement level did not predict the growth trajectories of mastery goals. Prior achievement level predicted the levels but not the rates of change in the growth trajectories of performance-approach goals and avoidance goals. These results indicated that roughly a one-letter-grade difference in GPA yielded a one-point drop in performance-approach and avoidance goals in the following semesters. Students who did well in the previous semester were less likely to endorse either performance-approach or avoidance goals. These relationships between prior achievement and subsequent goal adoption did not change over time, as indicated by nonsignificant Goal \u03eb Time interaction. Results are provided in Table 7 .",

The general pattern across these four time points was a decline from fall to spring in sixth grade, stability from spring of sixth grade to fall of seventh grade, and a decline from fall of seventh grade to spring of seventh grade. Previous research has implicated the transition to middle school as the source of the decline in goals (E. M. L. H. Anderman & Anderman, 1999) . However, with more time points, we found that the major source of the overall decline was within year, not between years. The average level of achievement goals in the beginning of middle school was similar to that in the spring of elementary school, which suggests that moving into a new, larger school environment was not immediately a catalyst for dramatic shifts in level of goals. A study concerning the change in elementary-school students' achievement goals for different types of literary tasks found declines from fall to spring (Meece & Miller, 2001) . Thus, the dissipation of goals in a similar classroom setting may be a trend that is in place prior to middle school. The finding that declines in goals occur with more experience in a specific classroom merits more attention. What aspects of the classroom environment are contributing to this? Does novelty, or an element of the unknown, heighten the pursuit of goals? Much attention has been devoted to classroom features that are associated with student goal pursuit, but researchers generally focuse on between-class differences of data at one time point (Wigfield et al., 2006) . Future research that examines how classroom features are related to the development of goals within the same environment could provide important insights into how teachers might best support students' goals.",

However, for performanceapproach goals, gender and race were important in understanding the developmental patterns (see Figure 3) . For girls, performanceapproach goals showed a similar pattern to that of the other goals (within-year declines for both elementary-and middle-school years). For boys, performance-approach goals declined during elementary school but increased during middle school. Considered in tandem with a Gender \u03eb Race interaction on the intercept, the results indicated that African American boys had the highest level of performance-approach goals of all students, at all time points, whereas European American boys were similar to girls in elementary school but had higher levels of performance-approach goals than did girls by the end of the first year in middle school. It is interesting that boys' performance-approach goals increase after moving into a context that is typically described as more competitive and performance oriented (Eccles et al., 1997; Midgley, 1993) . In general, boys' social interactions with peers involve more competition and dominance seeking than do girls' (e.g., Hartup, 1989; Maccoby, 1990; Rose & Rudolph, 2006) . Perhaps there is a match between this gendered characteristic and the middle-school context that causes performance-approach goals to increase for boys and not girls. Being better than others in the classroom may become more important to boys during early adolescence because it is in line with societal ideals of masculinity that emphasize competition, winning, and dominance. These issues may be salient for African American boys even earlier, as they had higher performance-approach goals than all other students, even before the increase for boys that occurred in middle school. It is concerning that African American boys had higher performanceapproach goals than did all other students in elementary school, given that performance-approach goals had a deleterious impact on achievement in that setting.",

Also consistent with prior research, boys were higher in a performance-avoidance goal than were girls. However, there were no interactive effects of either gender or race with goals on achievement, which indicated that the relation of goals to achievement was the same for all groups across time. Thus, similar to other aspects of motivation (e.g., ability perceptions), the mean levels may vary, but the nature of the consequences do not (see Graham, 1994 , for a review). Future research could further our understanding of group differences by examining if the antecedents of achievement goals are similar for all students. It may be that gender and/or ethnicity play a role in students' perceptions of or experiences in classrooms that may explain the different levels of achievement goals.",

When we controlled for prior achievement, a performance-avoidance goal had a consistent negative association with subsequent achievement across the four time points, which is in line with prior research that consistently documents the negative consequences of such goals. When we controlled for prior achievement, mastery goals were positive predictors of subsequent achievement at Times 2-4. Thus, mastery goals fostered the achievement of young adolescents, especially in the middle-school context. Findings for a performance-approach goal captured changing associations across time. A performanceapproach goal was detrimental to achievement in the elementaryschool context, particularly at Time 1 (negative association was significant at Time 1 and marginally significant at Time 2) and then became unrelated to achievement when students moved into middle school.",

The findings for a performance-approach goal were somewhat in line with this idea, as the detrimental effects on achievement dissipated as students moved into middle school. The findings for a mastery goal were contrary to this idea, as mastery goals became increasingly positive predictors of achievement as students moved into middle school. One possibility is that a mastery goal is especially facilitative of achievement in challenging academic situations. Grant and Dweck (2003) found that a mastery goal predicted more adaptive coping and higher achievement in the face of challenge for undergraduate students enrolled in a difficult premedical course. Students in our sample navigated a transition from a small elementary school to a large middle school. Against this backdrop, we saw GPA decline from elementary school to middle school. Thus, students likely experienced academic challenge or uncertainty during this transition. Our data indicate that a mastery goal supported students' achievement during this transition. However, a mastery goal was a positive predictor of achievement in the spring of elementary school, so this would not be a complete explanation.",

However, our findings are in line with much research on younger samples (e.g., Kaplan & Maehr, 1999; Pajares & Valiante, 2001; Wentzel, 1993) . Thus, conclusions about which achievement goals are best for learning and achievement are different for younger students in school and older adolescents in college. In addition to the educational climate becoming more competitive as students progress through the system, there are numerous other differences in context, sample, and developmental stage that may contribute to an explanation of the different patterns. Young adolescent students learn among their peers in classes all day, in contrast with college students who direct their own learning for much of the day. Young adolescent students have frequent assignments and feedback on their learning, whereas college students may only have two or three papers or exams per semester. Younger samples in public schools represent heterogeneity of ability levels from the broad spectrum of society, whereas samples taken from college represent only the upper ability levels. All of these differences may contribute to an explanation of why mastery goals are important to the achievement of young adolescents but not to college students.",

However, achievement is often the main concern of administrators and educators, especially given the current climate of standardized testing brought on by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 Act of (2002 . If mastery goals are not seen as having benefits for achievement, it is unlikely they will garner much attention for school reform. This could represent a missed opportunity for children in our schools, as much work has been done regarding how to create an educational climate that encourages mastery goals (e.g., Ames, 1992; Maehr & Midgley, 1996) .

Our first two sets of analyses concerned general patterns and variations between students (the first pertaining to the development of goals and the second pertaining to the associations of goals to achievement across time). Although general patterns are important in understanding normative shifts that occur, they do not address the significant variability in these patterns that exists for individual students. Regarding the development of goals, not all students conform to the general declining pattern of achievement goals. Regarding the changing goals-achievement relationship, there are intraindividual differences that tell us something different about the motivation-achievement link than do the interindividual differences. Similar to most prior research, our examination of general patterns of the link between achievement goals and achievement across time concerned how high or low scores in different types of goals, compared with other students, explained subsequent variations in achievement. In our final set of analyses, we focused on within-individual change to determine if inclines or declines from student's initial level of goals were important to understanding students' personal trajectory of achievement. Focusing on intraindividual change captures the dynamic nature of achievement goals that is widely acknowledged in theory but seldom captured in analytic approaches.",

In particular, deviation scores provided insight into how a mastery goal promotes positive changes in achievement across time. Above and beyond baseline scores, changes in mastery goals promoted changes in achievement. When we controlled for initial level, students who increased their mastery goals exhibited greater gains in achievement across time. Documenting such effects has important educational implications because it indicates that even for students with a \"maladaptive\" goal profile (i.e., low mastery goals), teachers only need to move them in the right direction for students to reap some achievement benefits. Encouraging a student to intensify his or her mastery goal may help students actually master the material. Personal reminders from teachers about the importance of a mastery goal may sustain or boost students' focus on mastery goals throughout the year, and such positive developments will, in turn, sustain or improve their achievement over time.",

These findings are not what one would expect on the basis of prior theory and research indicating that high perceptions of competence lead to approach goals and low perceptions of competence lead to avoidance goals (Elliot, 2005) . Because perceived competence and academic performance are moderately to highly correlated, one would expect a similar pattern for GPA. However, the nature of our design and analyses make them hard to directly compare with previous research. We controlled for prior achievement and modeled intraindividual changes in GPA. Thus, we examined the effects of changes in GPA, controlling for prior levels, on changes in achievement goals. With this approach, we documented that changes in achievement were important for performance goals and not for mastery goals. Our results suggest that changes in achievement may affect students' adoption of mastery versus performance goals, rather than approach versus avoidance goals.",

Ames (1990 Ames ( , 1992 has described how teacher practices in six categories (Task, Authority, Recognition, Grouping, Evaluation, Time) can promote a mastery-goal emphasis in classrooms. Qualitative work has expanded on Ames's work and noted how affect and teacher-student relationships are also critical to fostering a mastery-oriented climate (Patrick, Anderman, Ryan, Edelin, & Midgley, 2001; Patrick, Turner, Meyer, & Midgley, 2003; Turner et al., 2002) . Linnenbrink (2005) designed an intervention based on feedback to small groups that was successful in increasing students' mastery goals. Blackwell, Trzesniewski, and Dweck (2007) designed a Web-based intervention that increased students' malleable theory of intelligence, which in turn increased students' mastery goals and grades. Thus, although there are challenges in the current educational climate (see Urdan & Turner, 2005) , there is much knowledge about how to encourage mastery goals in students. All of this research could be drawn on to promote mastery goals in early adolescent students and to best support their learning and achievement.",

With our four time points of data, we documented within-year, but not between-year, declines in achievement goals in both sixth and seventh grades, indicating that the transition did not immediately have an impact on the average level of goals. However, it may be that the typical yearly pattern for students' goals is to decline across the year and then recover over the summer break, beginning high again the following year. It is possible that the middle-school transition does have an impact on the average level of student goal pursuit by disrupting this cycle. Future research encompassing additional years before the transition could further our understanding of typical cycles of motivation. In a cross-sectional study, Pajares and Cheong (2003) found nonlinear changes in mastery goals and performance-approach goals (decrease from elementary school to middle school and increase in high school for mastery goals and decrease from elementary school to middle school and no change in high school for performance-approach goals). There was no change in performance-avoidance goals. This is another intriguing developmental pattern that could be further investigated with longitudinal data. Although practically challenging, longitudinal studies following students from elementary school to college could better examine the proposition that performanceapproach goals exert a positive effect on achievement and mastery goals become null as students advance through the educational system.",

Recent research on achievement goals has investigatedstudents' general goals as well as subject-specific goals. 9 Both approaches are valid because achievement goals are conceptualized as a function of individual differences (i.e., personality, dispositions, or general motives) as well as due to features of the immediate environment. Students tend to approach schoolwork in different subjects in a similar way, as indicated by moderate to large correlations between the goals in different subjects (Bong, 2001; Elliot & McGregor, 2001 ). Further, achievement goals operate similarly across different academic subject areas (Bong, 2001; Wolters et al., 1996) , so measuring at a general level is unlikely to confound results. Nonetheless, there are differences in the nature of knowledge and teaching between subjects that may contribute to different developmental patterns at the subjectspecific level, and this could be a fruitful area for future research.",

Our focus on the development of goals across time in early adolescence revealed important patterns for this age group. At this stage of life, goals exhibit within-year rather than between-year decreases (with the exception of boys' performance-approach goals, which increase in middle school). As students move through early adolescence, mastery goals become increasingly beneficial for achievement. Performance-approach goals are detrimental in elementary school and provide no benefits in middle school. Performance-avoidance goals consistently undermine achievement throughout early adolescence. Personal increases in mastery goals over time provide a boost to student achievement. The overall implications of the present research is that mastery goals should be supported and encouraged in early adolescent students to best support their achievement. This recommendation is a deviation from recent conclusions based on data from college students regarding achievement goals and achievement. Thus, results highlight that a developmental perspective is critical to understanding achievement goals and achievement. More generally, we hope the results highlight the contribution a developmental approach can make toward understanding motivation and achievement. It is only with a complete understanding of the development of motivation, engagement, and achievement in school that we can make recommendations to educators and parents about what matters for student learning.",
