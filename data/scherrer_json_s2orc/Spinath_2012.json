Therefore, there is a vital interest among researchers and educators in understanding what influences intrinsic motivation, especially with regard to school-based learning. The present study investigated the roles of competence beliefs and goal orientations for change in intrinsic motivation. Three theoretically plausible ways in which competence beliefs and goal orientations might affect intrinsic motivation were investigated. First, we tested whether competence beliefs not only are closely associated with intrinsic motivation but might also be potential causes of changes in intrinsic motivation. Second, we tested whether the association between competence beliefs and intrinsic motivation varies systematically according to students' goal orientations. Specifically, theory suggests that in the presence of learning goals, ability self-concepts should be less important for the development of task enjoyment than in the presence of performance goals. Third, the assumption that goal orientations directly predict changes in intrinsic motivation was put to a test. To this end, data from a 12-month longitudinal investigation of highschool students' motivational development were analyzed by means of cross-lagged models and latent interaction analyses.",

Intrinsic motivation is a very desirable reason for performing achievement-related activities because learning comes as a by-product of engaging in an enjoyed task and learners feel self-determined. Therefore, intrinsic motivation can be considered to be an end of education in itself. In the school context, intrinsic motivation is often assessed with reference to specific subjects (e.g., \"How much do you like Math?\") and can also be assessed on a broader level with regard to school in general (e.g., \"How much do you like going to school?\").",

Achievement goals were originally distinguished into learning and performance goals (e.g., Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Nicholls, 1984) . Learning goals focus the person on the development of competence, whereas performance goals are aimed at the demonstration of competence relative to others (e.g., Elliot & McGregor, 2001) . Later on, Elliot and others separated performance goals into performance-approach (striving to demonstrate competence) and performance-avoidance goals (striving not to demonstrate incompetence; Elliot & Church, 1997; Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996) . Researchers have pointed out that there are different ways to demonstrate competence, for example, by trying to outperform others or by evoking the appearance of competence (e.g., Elliot, 1999; Hulleman, Schrager, Bodemann, & Harackiewicz, 2010) . In the conceptualization we use, performance-approach goals concern a focus on demonstrating compe-tence relative to others (see items in the Appendix). We conceptualize achievement goals as orientations that are relatively stable over time. Goal orientations can be assessed on a level tapping specific subjects (\"In math, it is important to me . . . \") or on a more general level (\"In school, it is important to me . . . \").",

                "text": "Before looking at potential explanations for change in intrinsic motivation, it is important to clarify what kind of change is observed at a certain age. Specifically, it is important to distinguish between mean level changes and intraindividual change across time. Much prior research has been devoted to establishing characteristic mean level changes in school-related intrinsic motivation across school trajectories. On the grounds of this research, it is well-known that the majority of children start school with very high intrinsic motivation but that intrinsic motivation for schoolrelated learning diminishes throughout elementary school and beyond (e.g., Gottfried, 1990; Gottfried, Fleming, & Gottfried, 2001; Spinath & Spinath, 2005; Spinath & Steinmayr, 2008) . This development stagnates when students are about 16 years old, and afterward even an increase in intrinsic motivation can be observed in some disciplines (e.g., Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Gottfried et al., 2001; Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, & Wigfield, 2002; Watt, 2004) . Although mean levels of intrinsic motivation stay constant or rise slightly after age 16, there is intraindividual change. This kind of change is visible in correlations between the same constructs over time. The present study aimed to find predictors of this intraindividual change over time at the turning point at which declining intrinsic motivation begins to stabilize (in terms of means) or even increase. Identifying these predictors might help to find ways to support the process of stabilizing and improving intrinsic motivation.",

                "text": "One potential explanation for why prior studies have failed to provide evidence for the effects of prior competence beliefs on subsequent intrinsic motivation is that moderator variables might mask the effect. Specifically, it can be argued that competence beliefs in the sense of ability self-concepts should be important for experiencing task enjoyment only under a performance-goal orientation but not under a learning-goal perspective. Persons with different goal orientations have different conceptions of success as well (e.g., Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Nicholls, 1984) . Under a learning-goal perspective, success depends on the perception that one has improved one's abilities. Improving one's competence and perceiving learning progress is possible at different levels of actual ability and, therefore, at all levels of ability self-concepts. Ability self-concept measures do not assess the intraindividual temporal change of competence that is important for persons with strong learning goals. Thus, under a learning-goal perspective, ability self-concepts should not influence intrinsic motivation. By contrast, under a performance-goal orientation, success depends on the demonstration of competence relative to others. The goals of demonstrating high competence or not demonstrating low competence are more likely to be reached when ability selfconcepts are positive. This is the case because the ability selfconcept measures exactly the kind of competence that is necessary to demonstrate competence relative to others, namely, the concept of competence measured against social or criterion-based standards. Therefore, students with strong performance goals should enjoy task engagement more when they have more positive ability self-concepts. In the case of negative ability self-concepts, students with performance goals should lose their task enjoyment because engaging in tasks for which one has low ability self-perceptions makes goal attainment unlikely. One could argue, however, that under a performance-avoidance goal orientation, students are very unlikely to experience intrinsic motivation at all, even if the goal of not demonstrating low competence is met. Nevertheless, ability self-concepts should be essential for intrinsic motivation in the presence of performance-avoidance goals because low ability selfconcepts should predict a steeper decline of intrinsic motivation than high ability self-concepts.",

Considering that individuals with a learning-goal orientation define success in terms of increased competencies (e.g., Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Nicholls, 1984) , learning goals should foster the experience of intrinsic motivation on any task that allows for learning progress. At school, many tasks offer the opportunity to learn something new. Therefore, students with strong learning goals have multiple chances to reach their primary goal (i.e., to increase their competence). This leads to the prediction that learning goals facilitate the experience of intrinsic motivation (see also Harackiewicz & Elliot, 1993; Heyman & Dweck, 1992; Rawsthorne & Elliot, 1999) .",

                "text": "For individuals with a performance-goal orientation, success can be reached only on tasks that allow one to demonstrate competence or to hide a lack of competence. Given the typical situation at school, not all students with strong performance goals can reach these aims. Although some students with performance-approach goals might succeed in demonstrating their competence, others will not, for example, because their actual competence falls short relative to others. In a similar vein, students with performanceavoidance goals will not always succeed in hiding what they think are low competences. As a consequence of missing their goals, students with performance goals are bound to lose their task enjoyment. Note, however, that students with performance goals who reach their aims are not expected to suffer from motivational impairment. For these reasons, performance goals are not expected to predict change in intrinsic motivation (see also, e.g., Harackiewicz, Barron, Carter, Lehto, & Elliot, 1997 , Harackiewicz, Barron, Tauer, Carter, & Elliot, 2000 , Harackiewicz, Barron, Tauer, & Elliot, 2002 . On the other hand, performance-avoidance goals are associated with negative feelings, such as fear of failure and test anxiety (e.g., Elliot & McGregor, 1999) , which are known to be incompatible with feelings of task enjoyment. In fact, some studies have found that performance-avoidance goals were negatively associated with intrinsic motivation (e.g., Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996) . Taken together, these theoretical considerations further the expectation that performance-approach goals are not predictive of change in intrinsic motivation. Performance-avoidance goals might either fail to predict or be negatively predictive of change in intrinsic motivation.",

Evidence for the predictive power of goal orientations for subsequent interest and task enjoyment comes from a set of longitudinal studies with college students in introductory psychology courses (e.g., Harackiewicz et al., 1997 Harackiewicz et al., , 2000 Harackiewicz et al., , 2002 .

Harackiewicz et al.

In a model with all goal orientations, only learning goals predicted interest and enjoyment. The effect of learning goals on interest was completely mediated by prior situational interest. Hulleman et al. (2008) showed in a sample of college students that higher initial interest predicted the adoption of learning goals and, different from what Harackiewicz et al. found, of performance-approach goals as well. As was expected, both initial interest and learning goals had direct effects on interest and task values.

Moreover, all previous studies have focused on college students and the subject of psychology. It is important to investigate different age groups and subjects. Investigating more than one academic subject in one study offers the opportunity to cross-validate results. Hulleman et al.'s study, like earlier studies from this research group (e.g., Harackiewicz et al., 1997 Harackiewicz et al., , 2000 Harackiewicz et al., , 2002 , reported no results for performance-avoidance goals; therefore, the study by Harackiewicz et al. is the only one to date that investigated performanceavoidance goals in this context. Finally, because goal orientations were assessed only once, a full cross-lagged analysis on the direction of potentially causal effects between interest or intrinsic motivation and goal orientations is still missing.

Second, clear time precedence needs to be established in longitudinal studies with at least two measurement occasions. Third, theoretical models must be tested by means of statistical techniques, such as structural equation modeling, with all latent constructs inferred on the basis of multiple indicators. When these prerequisites are fulfilled, reciprocal effects can be examined in cross-lagged analyses. With these models, a researcher can test whether time-lagged paths running from the potential predictor at Time 1 to the criterion variable at Time 2 reach statistical significance while controlling for the criterion variable at Time 1. Because the opposite direction of effects can be tested at the same time, these models are called reciprocal effects models (e.g., Marsh et al., 2005) .",

To investigate Research Question 1, cross-lagged models with competence beliefs and intrinsic motivation for each domain (school in general, math, and German) were set up (see Figure 1 ). To control for potential memory effects and, thus, positively overestimated stabilities between the different measurement occasions, models were set up with correlated uniqueness between all corresponding measures collected at the two measurement occasions. To investigate the second research question, latent interactions were modeled following the guidelines proposed by Marsh, Wen, and Hau (2004) . We used matched pairs as product indicators and used the unconstrained approach to estimate latent interaction effects. Matched pairs were built by multiplying z-standardized variables from each scale (assessed at Time 1) with each other. For example, the first item of the competence beliefs scale was multiplied by the first of four parcels indicating learning goals, the second competence beliefs item was multiplied by the second parcel indicating learning goals, and so on. Parcels for the three goal orientations were built by summing the first and second items of each goal orientation scale, the third and fourth items, and so on (scales with eight items had four parcels with two items each; the performanceapproach goals scale has seven items, so the seventh item stood alone). In each analysis, four product indicators loaded on the interaction factor indicating a possible interaction between ability beliefs and goal orientations. The goal orientation and the interaction factor (Competence Beliefs \u03eb Goal Orientation) were additionally introduced in the cross-lagged models described earlier and served as additional indicators of competence beliefs and intrinsic motivation at Time 2. All factors serving as predictors were correlated with each other. Finally, with regard to Research Question 3, cross-lagged models with intrinsic motivation and learning goals, performance-approach, and performanceavoidance goals, respectively, were tested for each domain. Again, models were set up with correlated uniquenesses between all corresponding measures.",

                "text": "The main aim of the present study was to illuminate the reasons for change in students' intrinsic motivation near the end of their school careers at the age of 17. This is an important age because the decline in intrinsic motivation typically stagnates at the age of 16, and afterward, even an increase in intrinsic motivation can be observed in some disciplines (e.g., Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Gottfried, Fleming, & Gottfried, 2001; Jacobs et al., 2002; Watt, 2004) . Therefore, it is important to investigate potential causal mechanisms responsible for this turning point. Our study is the first to investigate effects of competence beliefs and goal orientations on change in intrinsic motivation in this age group by means of a cross-lagged design. Cross-lagged designs are especially valuable for investigating potential causal influences among two variables (e.g., Marsh, 1990; Marsh et al., 1999) . In line with previous studies, little evidence was found that competence beliefs affected change in intrinsic motivation. This was also true after considering goal orientations as potential moderators of the relation between competence beliefs and intrinsic motivation. Instead, it could be shown that learning goals, but not performance goals, directly predicted the change in students' intrinsic motivation but not vice versa. In the following, these main results are discussed with regard to their implications for the further development of motivation theories and their practical implications.",

The first evidence in support of this assumption can be seen in the positive correlations among the two constructs that are typically found in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies (e.g., Wigfield et al., 1997) as well as in the parallel developmental trajectories (e.g., Watt, 2004) . Although such correlations and parallel trajectories are important preconditions for the existence of causal influences, few studies have used designs to test whether competence beliefs also predict change in intrinsic motivation (Jacobs et al., 2002; Marsh et al., 2005; Nurmi & Aunola, 2005; Skaalvik & Valas, 1999; Spinath & Spinath, 2005; Spinath & Steinmayr, 2008) . The majority of these studies found either no or only weak support for an influence of prior competence beliefs on change in intrinsic motivation (e.g., Skaalvik & Valas, 1999; Spinath & Spinath, 2005; Spinath & Steinmayr, 2008) . The present study replicated these findings in a crosslagged design with students at the end of their school trajectories. In two out of three domains (school in general and math), no effects emerged, whereas in German, competence beliefs predicted change in intrinsic motivation (we discuss this finding in more detail later). Only the study by Marsh et al. (2005) also reported small effects of prior competence beliefs on subsequent intrinsic motivation. If the magnitude of the cross-lagged paths serves as an estimate for potential causal effects, then the influence of competence beliefs on intrinsic motivation seems to be small at best.",

As in the present investigation, this might be the case in adolescents in particular because, at this developmental stage, important decisions about one's future have to be made, and the extent to which such decisions are perceived to be made autonomously is crucial for a person's well-being. Therefore, taking a self-determination theory perspective, future research should take into account both competence beliefs and perceived autonomy or locus of control when investigating change in intrinsic motivation.",

For persons with ability-demonstration goals, measuring competence relative to others or relative to certain criteria is important. For persons with ability-development goals, it is important to measure one's own competence against intraindividual temporal standards (i.e., observing the growth of one's own competence over time). This aspect is typically not assessed by ability self-concept measures and could be included in future studies. For this purpose, scales should be used that systematically vary the standards against which competence is measured (e.g., . The present study provided no evidence for the hypothesis that ability self-concept predicts change in intrinsic motivation in persons with performance goals (see discussion later) but did not test whether task-specific or intraindividual temporal competence beliefs measures predict intrinsic motivation in persons with learning goals. Whereas goal orientations were investigated in the present study, implicit theories are a promising candidate for future research. The work of Dweck and her colleagues (cf. Dweck, 1999) shows that implicit theories about the malleability of ability are largely independent of ability self-concepts. It can be expected that children who are convinced that their ability is not a fixed entity but can be increased should be more intrinsically motivated to learn and, thus, actually increase their competence. To corroborate these theoretical assumptions, future studies should include measures of implicit theories about the malleability of abilities when investigating influences on intrinsic motivation (see also Spinath & Spinath, 2005) .",

The temporal stability of intrinsic motivation in German was the lowest, and at the same time, the temporal stability of competence beliefs in German was the highest. This might be responsible for the finding that only in German did a significant cross-path from prior competence beliefs to subsequent intrinsic motivation emerge. This result is specified by the moderator analyses showing that prior competence beliefs predicted subsequent intrinsic motivation only for students with low learning and performance goals. It is not easy to explain why students' intrinsic motivation for German was less stable than motivation for math and school in general. If this had to do with changes in the contents that were taught in class, this should have also affected students' competence beliefs. However, instead of showing lower stability than the other domains, competence beliefs for German were the highest. This result is not in line with previous studies that showed no marked differences between temporal stabilities in German compared with other domains (e.g., Spinath & Steinmayr, 2008) . The most important question is whether the results found in the present study for German are a methodological artifact or whether there actually are different mechanisms that explain change in intrinsic motivation for German.

Including different ages in the picture is important as temporal stabilities of constructs might vary because of children's developmental stages and because of changes in the environment. With regard to developmental changes in temporal stability, both higher measurement reliability and firmer consolidation of interindividual differences contribute to higher temporal stabilities in older children and adults for most psychological constructs. Nevertheless, studies with elementary school children show that intrinsic motivation and competence beliefs for school domains have a considerable temporal stability even in the earliest school years when measured on a latent basis (e.g., Gottfried, Fleming, & Gottfried, 2001; Guay, Marsh, & Boivin, 2003; Spinath & Steinmayr, 2008) . If the differences in temporal stability between age groups are negligible, then comparisons of different age groups can provide evidence for the same or different mechanisms at different ages. With regard to environmental influences on temporal stability, researchers must consider that changes in class topics, teachers, or social reference groups can all be sources of instability in the constructs relevant for the present research. Future studies might use such environmentally induced changes to investigate phases of instability and change in intrinsic motivation in interventional instead of purely observational studies. Systematic interventions might be a means for shaking temporal stability to see which predictor enters through this door.",

This overlap makes it difficult to detect effects predicted for strong learning goals but not for strong performance goals and vice versa. Nevertheless, the overlap between different goals does not per se prevent empirical corroboration of predictions from goal theory. This can be concluded from the present results pertaining to the third hypothesis regarding direct effects of goal orientations on change in intrinsic motivation.

As a conclusion, we would like to stress that investigating predictions for each pure form of goal orientation is always a simplification.

As was hypothesized, no effect of performance goals on subsequent intrinsic motivation was found. This is an important finding because previous studies either did not investigate performance-avoidance goals (e.g., Harackiewicz et al., 1997 Harackiewicz et al., , 2000 Harackiewicz et al., , 2002 Hulleman et al., 2008) or produced inconsistent findings with regard to performanceapproach goals (e.g., Harackiewicz et al., 2008 , vs. Hulleman et al., 2008 . On the basis of the present results, we would like to stress that performance goals are not incompatible with intrinsic motivation for all students so that no overall association can be expected. Some students with performance goals will reach their goals (e.g., demonstrate competence to others) and might develop intrinsic motivation for tasks that they initially did for extrinsic reasons. However, there will also be students with performance goals who will not reach their goals of demonstrating or hiding competencies and, as a consequence, might lose their intrinsic motivation. Further research will have to differentiate more closely among students with performance goals and might distinguish certain subgroups with characteristic changes in intrinsic motivation.",

It would be interesting to investigate whether interest, as has been theorized, predicts change in achievement goals, whereas intrinsic motivation might not.",

This technique requires an honest appraisal of initial competencies because only a realistic appraisal allows for perceiving learning progress. On the grounds of the present findings, educators need not fear that confronting students with initial competence deficits might undermine their intrinsic motivation, as long as a learning-goals framework is set.",

By contrast, comparing students' performance with a social norm distracts attention from individual learning progress.
