    "abstract": "Although activity involvement has been linked to positive youth development, the value that adolescents place on these activities (i.e., how much they enjoy the activities, find them important, and spend time on them) has received less attention. The purpose of the present study was to examine the bidirectional longitudinal association between engagement in valued activities and adolescent positive adjustment (optimism, purpose in life, and self-esteem), as well as investigate a possible underlying mechanism for this link. High school students (N = 2,270, 48.7 % female) from Ontario, Canada completed questionnaires annually in grades 10, 11, and 12. Auto-regressive cross-lagged path analyses were conducted over time, controlling for gender, parental education, and academic grades. Greater engagement in valued activities predicted higher optimism, purpose, and self-esteem over time. Importantly, the results did not support an alternate hypothesis of selection effects, in that adolescents who were better adjusted were not more likely than their peers to engage in valued activities over time. We also found that the longitudinal associations between valued activities and positive adjustment may be due partly to an underlying effect of increased positive mood. Thus, engagement in valued activities appears to be important for adolescent positive adjustment, and may help to foster thriving. Communities, educators, and parents should actively support and encourage adolescents to develop valued activities, and seek to ensure that there are ample opportunities and resources available for them to do so.",

                "text": "A growing body of research has linked activity involvement to positive youth development (Hansen et al. 2003) . Much of the attention to date has focused on organized activities (e.g., school clubs, sports teams, etc.), which typically involve adult supervision, goal-setting, rules for behavior, regular participation schedules, and/or group settings of similar-aged peers (Denault et al. 2009 ). Yet youth activities that take place in non-organized contexts (e.g., hobbies done alone at home, such as reading, writing, computer programming, and crafts; or talents and special interests, such as mathematics, environmental issues and astronomy), also are important. In fact, the value that adolescents place on these activities (i.e., how much they enjoy the activities, find them important, and spend time on them), regardless of whether they take place in organized or non-organized contexts, might be especially important for promoting positive youth adjustment (Vallerand et al. 2003) . The focus of the present study specifically is on these valued activities.",

For example, some researchers use the term passions (e.g., Vallerand et al. 2003) , sparks (e.g., Scales et al. 2011) , or self-defining activities (Coatsworth et al. 2006) . Engagement in valued activities is thought to contribute to positive psychological adjustment (Benson and Scales 2009; Coatsworth et al. 2006) , such as providing individuals with a sense of purpose (Scales et al. 2011) , as well as a source of self-esteem (Bohnert et al. 2008a ). Yet, no studies have assessed the important question of the direction of effects between engagement in valued activities and positive adjustment. Only longitudinal studies can directly address this question; that is, by assessing both engagement in valued activities and positive adjustment over time, longitudinal studies can address the question of whether engagement in valued activities leads to increased positive adjustment over time, or whether positive adjustment leads to greater engagement in valued activities over time (selection effect). The purpose of the present study was specifically to examine the bidirectional association between engagement in valued activities and adolescent positive adjustment over time, as well as examine a potential mediator of the relationship between valued activities and adjustment, namely positive mood.",

                "text": "Research on engagement in valued activities in adolescence fits within the positive youth development (PYD) perspective (Larson 2000; Lerner et al. 2003) . The goal of research on PYD is to identify factors that promote the positive development, strength, health, and well-being of adolescents, as opposed to focusing primarily on ways to ameliorate negative or problematic aspects of development (e.g., drug use, depression; Benson and Scales 2009; Larson 2000; Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi 2000) . Thus, a focus on activities that are valued by adolescents which may support their positive adjustment and help them thrive (Benson and Scales 2009) is crucial. In fact, adolescence may be a sensitive period in the lifespan that might predispose individuals to develop valued activities, in contrast to other age periods such as childhood and adulthood. For example, a major developmental milestone of adolescence is identity exploration and development (Erikson 1968 ). One way adolescents may explore their identities is by engaging in various activities (Dworkin et al. 2003; Sharp et al. 2006) , and experimenting to see which ones they enjoy and best fit with their abilities. Engagement in activities also may facilitate pursuing future career options, in that adolescents can engage in activities to determine if they can make a long term commitment to a particular skill or occupation. In addition, engagement in activities may foster important developmental needs such as competence (e.g., learning new skills; feeling good about something) and autonomy (Leversen et al. 2012) . In comparison to children, adolescents possess more autonomy because they are less often supervised by adults and they have more choice in matters that are important to them (e.g., what leisure activities they pursue, how to spend their own money, how their time is allocated). In contrast, while adults have autonomy, they tend to have more obligations than adolescents (e.g., education, work and career, family, etc.), which might restrict their ability to spend time on valued activities. Therefore, adolescence in particular may be a sensitive period for the development of valued activities.",

                "text": "Researchers examining adolescent engagement in valued activities have shown concurrent associations with positive adjustment. For example, Scales et al. (2011) found that 15 year-olds' engagement in valued activities (called sparks in their study), when combined into a composite score along with supportive relationships and empowerment, was related concurrently to several adjustment indices, including grades, leadership, purpose, mastery goals, school engagement, and prosocial values. Coatsworth et al. (2006) found that high school students' engagement in valued activities (called self-defining activities in their study) was a significant concurrent predictor of subjective well-being (high positive affect, low negative affect, and life satisfaction) and internal assets (commitment to learning, positive values, and social competencies), after controlling for demographics and general activity involvement. Froh et al. (2010) conducted a longitudinal study with adolescents that examined their level of immersion (i.e., flow; Csikszentmihalyi 1990) when engaged in valued activities (called absorption in the study). The level of absorption in activities was related concurrently to several positive adjustment indices, including positive affect, life satisfaction, gratitude, selfesteem, and global happiness. Longitudinally, however, the effects did not hold. This finding is likely due to the fact that the authors controlled for social integration (i.e., passion for helping others) in the analyses, which was related to their measure of absorption in activities. According to Froh et al., adolescents with a passion for helping others likely also would become immersed in related activities.",

For example, it is possible that the significant association may be due to selection effects, in that individuals who are better adjusted may be more likely than their peers to engage in valued activities over time. That is, the reported benefits of engagement in valued activities on adjustment in past studies may be more a result of pre-existing differences in adjustment between adolescents who report greater engagement in valued activities in comparison to those with less engagement, rather than a direct result of engagement with valued activities. A study by Bohnert et al. (2008a) directly tested the direction of effects hypothesis, although their study specifically examined organized activity involvement rather than valued activities, and was conducted with a high-risk sample of adolescents. Bohnert et al. found support for a bidirectional relationship, in that selection effects were significant in addition to an effect from organized activities to greater emotional well-being over time. To the best of our knowledge, however, no studies have examined the bidirectional association between engagement in valued activities and positive adjustment. It is important to assess whether selection effects also may be an important factor in the link found between engagement in valued activities and positive adjustment, before we conclude that engagement in valued activities may promote positive adjustment over time.",

One potential mediator is positive mood. Positive mood is defined as ''the extent to which a person feels enthusiastic, active, and alert,'' (Watson et al. 1988 (Watson et al. , p. 1063 . Researchers suggest that engagement in valued activities may result in positive mood during (Benson and Scales 2009; Fredricks et al. 2010 ) and after (Vallerand et al. 2003) time spent on the activity. In support of this hypothesis, Bohnert et al. (2008b) found an association between positive affect and youth activity involvement [specifically discretionary time activities (i.e., not school or work related) that required the adolescent to exert energy and effort], regardless of whether the activities were organized or non-organized. Empirical evidence for this link also was provided by Vallerand et al. (2003) . The authors demonstrated that adults report more positive emotions during and after engagement in their activities, and fewer negative emotions after the activity. Longitudinal associations also have been found between activities and later positive affect in adolescents, including higher positive emotions (Carbonneau et al. 2010) and eudaimonic well-being (Philippe et al. 2009) .",

The theory states that the experience of positive emotions (e.g., interest, happiness, joy, etc.) broadens people's attention and thinking (i.e., heightens openness to new possibilities, ''big picture'' focus, etc.), in comparison to negative emotions, which tend to result in a narrowing of focus (i.e., to support actions such as attack, escape, etc.). The broadening of attention, in turn, is thought to build personal resources (social bonds, creativity, intellectual knowledge, physical health, adaptive coping strategies) which lead to increased positive adjustment (Fredrickson et al. 2008) . Frederickson and colleagues (Fredrickson et al. 2003 (Fredrickson et al. , 2008 have demonstrated in an adult sample that the experience of positive emotions leads to broadened attentional and behavioral tendencies, and that positive emotions are related to adjustment indices (optimism, tranquility, ego resilience, mental health, and close relationship quality) both concurrently and longitudinally. Philippe et al. (2010) specifically tested the broaden and build theory in their study of valued activities. They asked undergraduate students to indicate how often they engaged in a highly valued activity, and whether they engaged in the activity with other people. Philippe et al. found that positive emotions measured in the context of the activity mediated the link between frequency of involvement in the valued activity and the quality of the interpersonal relationships the students had when engaging in their activity. This finding supports the suggestion that positive mood might mediate the association between engagement in valued activities and positive adjustment. It remains to be seen, however, whether these results also hold for indicators of positive adjustment that are more general (e.g., purpose in life, optimism, and self-esteem) than interpersonal relationships related specifically to the context of the valued activity.",

Organized youth activities have been found to be linked to positive adjustment both concurrently and longitudinally (e.g., Eccles and Barber 1999; Fredricks and Eccles 2006; Hansen and Larson 2007; Mahoney et al. 2005; Shernoff 2010) . Given these findings, it is important to clarify that any positive association between valued activities (which can encompass both organized activities such as school clubs, and non-organized activities such as reading) and adjustment is not due simply to the fact that some valued activities might involve organized activities. Thus, in the present study, we specifically tested whether engagement in valued activities still predicted positive adjustment even when organized activity involvement was accounted for in the analyses.",

The overall participation rate ranged from 83 to 86 % across all the waves of data collection; non-participation was due to student absenteeism (average of 13.5 %), parental refusal (average of .06 %), or student refusal (average of 1.4 %). Student absenteeism from class was due to illness, a co-op placement, a free period, or involvement in another school activity. Consistent with the broader Canadian population (Statistics Canada 2001), 92.5 % of the participants were born in Canada and the most common ethnic backgrounds reported other than Canadian were Italian (32 %), French (17 %), British (16 %), and German (11 %). Data on socioeconomic status indicated mean levels of education for mothers and fathers falling between ''some college, university or apprenticeship program'' and ''completed a college/apprenticeship/technical diploma.'' Further, 71 % of the respondents reported living with both birth parents, 14 % with one birth parent and a stepparent, 15 % with one birth parent (mother or father only), and the remainder with other guardians (e.g., other relatives, foster parents, etc.). The analysis for the present study involved a cohort of 2,270 students (48.7 % girls) who were invited to complete the survey three times, in 2006, 2007, and 2008 when they were in grades 10, 11, and 12, respectively, as this was the only cohort that were surveyed on the valued activities measure.",

First, participants were asked if they had a valued activity (''Do you have a hobby, talent, or special interest [or activity]?''); participants who did not report having a valued activity had the option of selecting I don't have a hobby, talent, special interest for each of the frequency, importance, and enjoyment questions. Next, frequency was assessed with the item, ''How often do you work on your hobby, talent, or special interest (or activity)?'', and possible responses ranged from 0 = never to 4 = every day. Importance was assessed with the item, ''How important is the hobby, talent, or special interest (or activity) to you?'', and possible responses ranged from 0 = not at all important to 3 = very important. Finally, enjoyment was assessed with the item, ''How often do you enjoy working on your hobby, talent, special interest (or activity)?'', and possible responses ranged from 0 = never to 4 = every time. The importance item was multiplied by a constant (1.33) to rescale it to match the other two items, creating three items rated on a 5-point scale (0-4). For each of the three items, we recoded a response of I don't have a hobby, talent, special interest to the lowest anchor score for that question (i.e., never or not at all important), thus including these participants in all analyses. Note that less than 1 % of the participants who reported having valued activities responded with never or not at all important for the three items, so there was almost no overlap in the scores for participants who had valued activities versus those without valued activities. The three items were averaged to produce a composite score, with higher scores indicating greater engagement in valued activities. A principal components factor analysis using the three items extracted a single factor for all waves, and Cronbach's alphas were .92, .95, and .95 for grades 10, 11, and 12 respectively.",

To help ensure that any missing data within a wave likely would be missing at random, we included three versions of the survey at each time period so that the same scales were not always near the end of the survey. Importantly, at each grade there were no significant differences on the study measures among participants who completed the survey at one time period, at two time periods, or at all three time periods, Wilks ks [ .05, g 2 ranging from .013 to =.016, although there were significant differences on the covariates depending on the number of waves completed (i.e., gender, academic marks, and parental education, Wilks ks \\ .05, g 2 ranging from .018 to .181; that is, participants who completed the survey at one time period were more likely to be male, and to report lower academic marks and parental education than their peers). As missing data appeared not to be dependent on the values of the study measures, it is reasonable to assume that this data is missing at random (Little and Rubin 2002; Schafer and Graham 2002) , and thus data from all participants were included in the analyses.

Moreover, much of the research that has been conducted on valued activities among adolescents has assessed only concurrent associations with adjustment (Coatsworth et al. 2006; Scales et al. 2011) . Although engagement in valued activities is thought to lead to higher levels of positive adjustment over time, this interpretation has yet to be directly tested in a longitudinal study (see Leversen et al. 2012) . The current study is the first known study to examine bidirectional associations between engagement in valued activities and positive adjustment longitudinally in an adolescent sample, and to assess whether positive mood might be a possible underlying mechanism for this association. Consistent with our hypothesis, engagement in valued activities predicted greater purpose in life, optimism, and self-esteem over time. These longitudinal associations between valued activities and positive adjustment suggest a possible long-lasting link between these constructs. The results also extend previous findings from concurrent research studies that have found that adolescents' valued activities predicted positive adjustment (Froh et al. 2010) . Importantly, the results did not support an alternate hypothesis of selection effects, as participants who were higher in positive adjustment (purpose in life, optimism, and self-esteem) did not show significantly greater engagement in valued activities over time. This finding is in contrast to the results reported by Bohnert et al. (2008a, b) , who found some support for selection effects. Important differences exist between their study and ours, however, in that they examined the link between organized activities and emotional well-being, and used a high-risk sample. Overall, our results are consistent with theories of valued activities stating that these activities can provide opportunities for positive development, such as an increased sense of purpose and self-esteem (Benson and Scales 2009; Bohnert et al. 2008a, b; Scales et al. 2011) .",

Similarly, Philippe et al.

The current study offers an important extension of the Philippe et al. study because the mediating effect of positive mood was not restricted to the context of valued activities, but generalized beyond valued activities to a more general measure of positive affect. Additionally, the current study extended Philippe et al.'s study because the significant associations between valued activities and adjustment were not restricted to interpersonal relationship quality, but included other measures of positive adjustment, namely purpose in life, optimism, and self-esteem. Overall, our findings suggest that increased positive mood might be an important mechanism for the link between valued activities and adjustment, and provide an important addition to the growing literature outlining the benefits of activity involvement.",

Nevertheless, the present study was limited by a lack of a direct measure of whether the valued activities were organized or unorganized. Future research should add this assessment, as well as examine whether the valued activities exhibit the various characteristics of organized activities (i.e., goal-directed, group setting, regular practice times). In addition, the measurement of valued activities in the current study did not capture any variability due to the type of valued activities adolescents possessed. This is an important consideration as the measurement of valued activities in the current study was very broad and could have captured a wide variety of activities. Future research should measure the type of valued activities in order to uncover any possible interaction effects with positive adjustment. We also did not examine how many valued activities participants possessed. This distinction should be investigated in future research, as researchers examining organized youth activities have stated that both breadth and depth may offer unique contributions to positive outcomes (Rose-Krasnor et al. 2006) . Furthermore, given the constraints of long-term longitudinal studies, purpose in life was measured using only one item. Future research should expand the measurement of this construct. Finally, the strengths of the effect sizes, as indicated by standardized regression coefficients, were small in magnitude. However, these effect sizes are common in cross-lagged models that account both for stability between adjacent waves of data and for concurrent associations among variables within each grade. With these stringent analyses, small effects are not unexpected.",

This finding has significant implications for supporting adolescent development. It may be worthwhile to invest in resources to allow adolescents greater access to activities, interests, or important causes that may develop over time into valued activities. The presence of these resources can act as ''affordances'' (Gibson 1982) that encourage engagement in these activities. Parents and educators also should actively support and encourage adolescents to consider whether they do, in fact, have valued activities, and if not, to explore available opportunities in an effort to find activities they will value. Any investment in factors that may help to foster positive adjustment and thriving, as described by proponents of the PYD perspective, should be worthwhile as these adolescents may in turn offer positive contributions to their contexts. In fact, adolescence may be an especially important age period to make this investment, as adolescents are more likely than children or adults to be seeking out opportunities to develop autonomy, as well as to explore their identities.",
