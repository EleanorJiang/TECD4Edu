Latent structural modeling analysis revealed that a mastery climate predicted higher levels of perceived academic competence perceived in the first year of middle school, although attachment security to the mother in Grade 6 predicted perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms in the first year of middle school. A moderating effect was found, in which greater attachment security to the mother appeared to lessen the relationship between a performance climate and anxiety symptoms during the middle school transition. Conclusion.-The results suggest that attachment security to the mother predicts perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms during the middle school transition.

                "text": "Perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms are two personal characteristics well established in the field of motivation Freiberger, Steinmayr, & Spinath, 2012; Ley & Young, 2001 ). Perceived academic competence refers to students' subjective evaluations of their ability to perform and their beliefs about resources they need to do well (Bandura, 1986; Bouffard, Marcoux, Vezeau, & Bordeleau, 2003) . As for anxiety, it is defined as a reaction to a real or anticipated threat, expressed via a complex system of behaviors cognitions, emotions, and physiological symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Weissman, Antinoro, & Chu, 2009) . Studies have shown that perceived academic competence (or analogous constructs) and anxiety symptoms are closely related to the school experience. For instance, perceived academic competence has been associated with a stronger endorsement of mastery-approach goals (Elliot & Church, 1997; Maltais, Duchesne, Ratelle, & Feng, 2015; Poulin, Duchesne, & Ratelle, 2010) and, in certain cases, with the endorsement of performance-approach goals (Elliot & Church, 1997; Linnenbrink, 2005) . On the other hand, anxiety has been positively associated with endorsing performance-avoidance goals Elliot & Church, 1997; Linnenbrink, 2005; Maltais et al., 2015) and negatively with academic engagement, perseverance, and achievement Guay et al., 2003; Marsh et al., 2005; Shen & Tam, 2008) .",

Many found that perceived academic competence declined between the end of elementary school and the beginning of middle school (Eccles et al., 1989; Wigfield et al., 2006; Wigfield, Eccles, Mac Iver, Reuman, & Midlgey, 1991) . Others found greater stress and emotional problems during this period Roeser & Eccles, 1998; Urdan & Midgley, 2003) . Some studies corroborate the notion that early adolescence is a period when anxiety symptoms could first appear (Hale, Raaijmakers, Muris, Van Hoof, & Meeus, 2008; Jones, 2013) . In sum, research suggests that many youths are at risk for motivational (lower perceived academic competence) and emotional problems (greater anxiety symptoms) in early adolescence.",

Surprisingly, there is very little information on the relative contribution of these two relational contexts. In line with past research (Duchesne, Ratelle, Larose, & Guay, 2007; Friedel, Cortina, Turner, & Midgley, 2007; Gonida, Voulala, & Kiosseoglou, 2009) , we expect that taking into account both contexts will yield a deeper understanding of the role of the learning climate and parental attachment security in predicting perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms. Such knowledge will provide the basis of preventive measures to be implemented in the transition to middle school by schools and families.",

On the one hand, a mastery-oriented climate (MC) is structured around the development of competence as well as academic progress and achievement. In an MC, learning situations are diversified and stimulating. Teachers emphasize effort and understanding, support student autonomy, and provide feedback that students can use to fix their self-reference standards and realize that errors are a part of the learning process. On the other hand, a performance-oriented climate (PC) places the emphasis on demonstrated competence and outperforming others. Here, students are more likely to be organized into groups based on their levels of achievement. Also, social recognition is more likely to be bestowed on students who meet prescriptive performance standards, with special privileges granted to high achievers. Furthermore, assessment methods encourage students to compare themselves with others or normative standards.",

Researchers largely agree that MC is beneficial for academic outcomes in terms of perceived academic competence and positive emotions (Duchesne et al., 2012; Linnenbrink, 2005) , whereas PC appears to foster negative emotions and anxiety, particularly during evaluative contexts (Linnenbrink, 2005; Patrick, Ryan, & Kaplan, 2007; Skaalvik, 1997; Wolters, 2004) . However, the potentially harmful effects of a PC may vary according to students' personal characteristics, such as feeling competent at school (Anderman & Patrick, 2012) or presenting anxious dispositions (Duchesne et al., 2012) . In the latter case, it was demonstrated that students who expressed worries about social relationships in Grade 6 reported more adjustment problems in the second year of middle school if they were exposed to a PC in the first year of middle school (Duchesne et al., 2012) . Hence, perceiving the learning climate as performance-oriented upon entering middle school could interact with other variables (e.g., parent-child relationship) during this transition, which would help to explain undesirable effects on the school experience.",

Studies on this topic have mostly found direct associations linking parental attachment to perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms. However, attachment security might interact with other variables (e.g., personal characteristics), because it has been reported to provide strong protection against situations perceived as threatening or stressful (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Walls, 1978; Bretherton & Munholland, 2008; Brumariu & Kerns, 2010; . Attachment is a system of motivational and emotional regulation based on the establishment of a deep and enduring emotional bond with an attachment figure, usually the mother (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bowlby, 1973) . The comfort that the attachment figure provides in times of distress encourages the child to explore the environment. Over time, these experiences of comfort and security are incorporated into an internal working model, i.e. a cognitive framework that represents the world, the self, and others as either trustworthy or untrustworthy. A secure (trustworthy) internal working model allows children to view themselves as worthy of respect and affection, and that others will be responsive and supportive to help them deal with stressful situations. Conversely, when children anticipate rejection or inconsistent responses by the attachment figure in times of distress, they tend to develop a deep feeling of discomfort or insecurity. Thus, insecurely attached children build self-representations that foster the belief that they are not worthy of respect or affection from others (Maier et al., 2005) .",

The findings indicate that securely attached young adolescents perceive themselves as more competent at the beginning of middle school (Maltais et al., 2015; Papini & Roggman, 1992) and present low levels of worries regarding the middle school transition (Duchesne et al., 2009) . Attachment security to the mother was also related to fewer internalized problems such as anxiety and depression in the transition to middle school (Duchesne et al., 2009; Kenny, Lomax, Brabeck, & Fife, 1998; Maltais et al., 2015; Nada Raja, McGee, & Stanton, 1992; Papini & Roggman, 1992; Sund & Wichstr\u00f8m, 2002) . Specifically, securely attached young adolescents are more apt to self-regulate negative emotions (e.g., lack of aggression, better ego control), compared to their insecurely attached peers, who are more inclined to exhibit distress (Allen, Moore, Kuperminc, & Bell, 1998; Armsden, McCauley, Greenberg, Burke, & Mitchell, 1990) , especially in the transition to middle school .",

Thus, young adolescents who are securely attached to their mother would be more prone to develop a positive self-image and perceptions of competence, engage in autonomous and confident exploration in times of instability (e.g., a new math learning climate), and express and regulate their emotions appropriately. In turn, appropriate emotional expression and regulation would flourish in an autonomy-supportive environment that encourages effort and provides opportunities to learn from mistakes. At the same time, these young adolescents could be more resistant to environmental stimuli that they perceive as undesirable (e.g., recognition of performance or better performing students).",

The sample was stratified according to gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic region. Between March and April of each year, students completed a questionnaire that they received by regular or electronic mail.

Unlike linear regression analysis, LSM uses algorithms to integrate data, which allows reducing the probability of type II errors (i.e., accepting a false null hypothesis). In linear regression, type II errors are more likely to be caused by the presence of manifest variables (centered variables), used to reduce multicolinearity problems (Moosbrugger, Schermelleh-Engel, Kelava, & Klein, 2009) . On the other hand, LSM analyses with Mplus cannot estimate simple linear models used to calculate fit indices (e.g., CFI, RMSEA, 2 ) or standardized values. In addition, this analysis does not provide the interaction variance, because it does not set the variance of the interactive items. Nevertheless, a guideline developed by Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n (2008-2012) allows calculating variance and R 2 for the model, standardized parameters, and plotting interaction. Computations were simplified by fixing the parameter variances to 1. Finally, the effect size was interpreted according to Cohen's criteria, which stipulate that a coefficient (\u00c1 2 ) of .01 corresponds to a small effect size, .09 to a medium effect size, and .14 to a large effect size (Cohen, 1988) .",

In the latter case, the 10 items for attachment were grouped into 5 indicators and the 12 anxiety items into 4 indicators in order to limit the number of parameters to estimate and thereby improve the analysis reliability (Marsh & Yeung, 1998) . Fit indices for the CFA model indicated satisfactory relationships between the indicators and their respective latent factors, 2 (303; n = 613) = 522.55, p < .01; CFI = .93; TLI = .92; RMSEA = .03. Factor loadings varied from .40 to .82 (Table 2) . Table 1 shows that most latent factors were correlated with each other and in the expected direction.

Correlation coefficients also showed a moderate positive association between attachment in Grade 6 and perceived academic competence in the first year of middle school (r = .28, p < .01), as well as a moderate negative association between attachment in Grade 6 and anxiety in the first year of middle school (r = \u2212.25, p < .001).

This finding is in line with other studies that have indicated attachment security was negatively associated with worries regarding the transition to middle school (Duchesne et al., 2009) , but positively with academic engagement and achievement (Jacobsen & Hofmann, 1997) . Perceived attachment to the mother might therefore encourage self-beliefs (\"I am worthy of attention, affection, and respect\") that facilitate confident exploration of new and demanding situations. This combination of positive self-beliefs and an exploratory disposition could encourage young adolescents in interpreting their experiences early in middle school as positive (e.g., feeling that they could handle assignments and complete them successfully), which would sustain, or even improve, self-perceptions of academic competence in the first year of middle school. Contrary to the hypothesis that a PC in math would predict decreases in perceived academic competence in the first year of middle school, we found no association between these two constructs. Moreover, this lack of an association was independent from perceived attachment security to the mother. Given this information, it is possible that a PC is indirectly associated with perceived academic competence through a third variable, such as anxiety.",

These associations remained even when controlling for gender and pretransition anxiety symptoms. Duchesne et al. (2012) showed that perceptions of a PC can undermine social, academic, and psychological adjustments for young adolescents who are inclined to worry. When exposed to a PC, where messages and learning methods are usually oriented toward peer comparisons and individual aptitudes (Meece et al., 2006) , some adolescents might not feel as good as their classmates (i.e., less worthy) and might have adjustment problems (Duchesne et al., 2012) . However, our results suggest that such anxiety-provoking climates could be offset by a secure attachment relationship with the mother. A mother who provides a feeling of security can be receptive and supportive when her child expresses negative emotions about school experiences. For instance, she could be understanding, help the child find solutions, and spend time doing enjoyable activities together to help the child build a positive self-image .",

Yet, previous studies have shown that an MC is generally related to positive effects on adaptive learning (e.g., positive affects, high perceived self-efficacy; Urdan & Midgley, 2003) , as well as satisfaction with learning (Anderman & Midgley, 1997) , and lower anxiety during competitive physical education events (Papaioannou & Kouli, 1999) . The general explanation for these associations is that an MC classroom tends to have structured tasks and encourages goals and strategies that emphasize progress, effort, and the enjoyment of learning. The lack of an association in the present study suggests that such a learning climate, as perceived by students, would not heighten anxiety symptoms in stressful times (i.e., during the middle school transition). However, it is also plausible that the MCanxiety association is moderated by students' gender such that MC would protect girls more than boys (see below).",

The combination of personal and environmental stressors increases girls' vulnerability to develop emotional problems at this time (Nolen-Hoeksema & Girgus, 1994) .",

This suggests that a mother who is available, accessible, responsive, warm, and open to discussion is more liable to creating the conditions that foster emotional regulation during this highly stressful time . Hence, education and social professionals working with parents of children undergoing a school transition should encourage parents to be supportive of their children in order to help them manage feelings that threaten their sense of well-being.",

In light of our results, youths who are exposed to a learning environment that emphasizes competition and performance (PC) would be more liable to present anxiety symptoms in the first year of middle school if they perceive an insecure attachment relationship with their mother. Teachers should therefore be made aware that these youths might be more vulnerable than others to messages and practices that stress individual aptitudes and peer comparisons. The meaning underlying such messages can have detrimental effects on students' perceptions that they can meet the teacher's demands, their motivation in class, their interactions with peers, and their psychological well-being.",

For example, young adolescents' anxiety symptoms may have undermined their ability to objectively assess their perceptions of attachment security to their mother, or the type of learning climate to which they were exposed. Second, the fact that the data were obtained from a single source (adolescents themselves) increases the likelihood that the observed effects were attributable to shared method variance. Future studies should consider using additional data sources, such as parents, to assess attachment security. Third, perceptions of the learning climate were measured with respect to a math class. Consequently, the results might not be generalized to all school subjects in the first year of middle school. Fourth, we did not consider some crucial antecedents of perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms in our model (e.g., actual level of performance, importance attached to maths, individual goal orientation, socioeconomic status; Barron & Harackiewicz, 2001; Bouffard et al., 2003; Duchesne et al., 2008; Harackiewicz & Elliot, 1998) . Considering such factors could undermine the direct contribution of attachment security to perceived academic competence or its protective effect on the negative relationship from a performance climate to anxiety symptoms. Finally, only attachment security to the mother was considered in this study. It would be useful, in future studies, to examine if the contribution of attachment security to the father is similar to or different from attachment security to the mother. Along this line, a recent study found that attachment security to the father made a unique and complementary contribution to changes in depressive symptoms during adolescence .",

The results showed that perceived attachment security to the mother at the end of elementary school predicted perceived academic competence at the end of the first year of middle school. Furthermore, attachment security appeared to protect against anxiety symptoms in students who perceived their teacher's practices as emphasizing competition and social comparison (PC).
