    "abstract": "This study examined the effects of change in teacher goal emphases on students' efficacy beliefs in mathematics across the transition to middle school. The sample (N \u03ed 929) included primarily White (65%) and Black (27%) students, and approximately one third received free or reduced-fee lunch. Analyses grouped children by cross-classification of teachers (N \u03ed 53 elementary and N \u03ed 34 middle school teachers). On average, students' efficacy beliefs remained stable and relatively high across the transition. Compared with their elementary school teacher, children reported declines in both perceived teacher mastery and performance goal emphases in middle school. A cross-classified hierarchical linear model was used to estimate the effects of perceived teacher and parent goal emphases during 6th and 7th grades on changes in students' efficacy beliefs. An increase in self-efficacy beliefs from elementary to middle school was predicted by an increase in group-level perceptions of teachers' mastery goal emphasis, even after controlling for parents' goal emphases. These findings underscore the important role that both teachers' and parents' goal emphases play as children develop a sense of efficacy in mathematics.",

                "text": "Fifteen years ago, researchers studying grade level transitions in the middle years of childhood noted that a majority of children were experiencing declines in motivation and achievement, which seemed to coincide with a misfit between students' needs and characteristics of the learning environment (for reviews, see Eccles & Midgley, 1989; Wigfield, Eccles, Schiefele, Roeser, & Davis-Kean, 2006) . Since that time, several studies have supported this assertion by demonstrating a link between such declines and students' perceptions of the learning environment as characterized by the goals teachers emphasize (E. M. Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Lau & Nie, 2008; Midgley, Anderman, & Hicks, 1995; Pintrich, 2000b; Young, 1997) . Some have suggested that the goals children perceive teachers to emphasize can ameliorate the declines typically experienced as children transition to higher grade levels (Gutman, 2006; Meece, Anderman, & Anderman, 2006; Urdan & Midgley, 2003) . Thus far, studies have considered students' perceptions to be individual-level predictors of change and have not taken into account the effect of a specific classroom context on a group or class of children, either before or after the transition to middle school. In addition, these studies have not taken into account the effect of students' perceptions of goals emphasized by parents during this important transition. In the present study we build on prior research by examining changes in goal structure reported by groups of children who encounter the same teachers as they transition from sixth to seventh grade mathematics classes, enabling hierarchical modeling of group-and individual-level effects on changes in one key motivational outcome, self-efficacy. These relations are examined, taking into account the goals children themselves espouse across this transition as well as students' perceptions of the goals parents emphasized for them in mathematics. Miller, 1997; Schunk, 1995) . Self-efficacy differs slightly from perceived ability or competence (\"I am good at math\"), in that it is a measure of students' anticipated success given their current capabilities (\"I can master the skills in math this year if I try\"). It has been related to higher levels of learning, persistence, effort and achievement (Bong & Skaalvik, 2003; Schunk, 1996) , even after accounting for previous achievement and cognitive skills.",

For example, a child may engage in a task to develop ability or understanding, judging performance in terms of improvement over time or progress relative to an absolute standard. This reflects a task or mastery orientation. Children may also strive to demonstrate their ability at a task or the ease with which they can do a task, often focusing on performance relative to others as a measure of success. This has been termed an ability or performance orientation. Research suggests that different goals may be pursued simultaneously and that people may orient themselves toward different goals in different subject areas or skill domains (E. M. Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Bong, 2001; Pintrich, 2000b) .",

Goal theorists posit that children are sensitive to the emphasis teachers place on different types of achievement goals as expressed through instructional practice and the ways in which teachers respond to students' accomplishments or shortcomings. For example, research has demonstrated that the nature of classroom tasks (cooperative vs. competitive) and the types of evaluation or recognition strategies (focus on individual improvement vs. ability relative to others) Figure 1 .

Anderman and Midgley (1997) examined changes in students' individual perceptions of classroom goal structure, personal goal orientation, and perceived academic competence (a precursor to the self-efficacy assessment used in the present study) as children transitioned to middle school. Children reported a decline in perceived mastery goal structure and personal mastery goals across the transition and an increase in perceived performance goal structure. Concurrently, they reported a decline in levels of perceived academic competence across the transition. Urdan and Midgley (2003) tested whether changes in students' individual perceptions of classroom goal structures predicted changes in personal goal orientations, self-efficacy beliefs, and affect in mathematics across the transition to middle school and within middle school across grade levels. They used change scores to group children according to whether they perceived an increase, no change, or a decrease in each type of goal structure at each time point and analyzed differences across groups in personal goals, efficacy beliefs, and affect. They found stronger and more consistent relations between changes in perceived mastery goal structure and student outcomes, relative to changes in perceived performance goal structure, and that decreases in mastery goal structure predicted more dramatic changes in outcomes than did increases. Whereas children who perceived a decrease or no change in mastery goal structure reported declines in personal mastery orientation, self-efficacy, affect, and achievement, these declines were not evident for children who perceived an increase in mastery goal structure. These findings highlight the importance of continuity in mastery goal emphasis across grade level transitions and provide further support for the link between the goals children perceive teachers to emphasize in the classroom and adaptive motivational outcomes, including self-efficacy in mathematics.",

However, they did not assess the extent to which individual change in efficacy was accounted for by classroomlevel differences in the goals children perceived teachers to emphasize, either prior to or following a grade level transition. Do children who experience the same teachers across the transition report similar changes in their self-efficacy beliefs, as a function of the goals they perceive teachers to emphasize? Thus we examine changes in students' reports of self-efficacy in mathematics, taking into account group-level perceptions of goals emphasized by teachers before and after the transition from sixth to seventh grade.",

Further, personal mastery goals mediated the relation between perceived emphases (both parent and teacher) on mastery goals and students' academic self-efficacy for mathematics. The relation between perceived parent and personal goals at different stages of development was recently examined by Gonida, Klosseoglou, and Voulala (2007) . The data presented further support the notion that the relation between perceived goals and outcomes is mediated by students' personal goal orientations.

Pomerantz, Ng, and Wang (2006) found that mothers' use of mastery-oriented practices during homework sessions predicted students' positive emotional states; for children with initially low self-competence, it was positively related to students' personal endorsement of mastery goals and to an increase in selfcompetence during the school year.

Items measuring perceptions of the teacher's emphasis on performance goals (five items; two approach-oriented, two avoid-oriented, and one neutral item) assessed whether the teacher calls attention to children who receive the highest grades and test scores, tells the class who is doing well or poorly in math, and provides children with information about how they do compared to other children.

The longitudinal scale assessing perceptions of parent mastery emphasis included two items that asked children whether their parents wanted them to understand math concepts and attempt challenging problems.

These asked children whether parents would be pleased if they could demonstrate superior ability compared with others and whether parents were concerned with the child's performance relative to others.

Variables included at this level were perceived teacher emphasis on mastery and performance goals during spring of sixth grade and fall of seventh grade. Note that our hypotheses related to the particular combination of sixth and seventh grade classroom experiences. Classroom level variables were computed by aggregating perceptions of students who were members of a class at a given time point. Level 3 groups were then formed by cross-classifying children on the basis of their combination of sixth and seventh grade math teachers, resulting in 182 groups. Of these groups, only those composed of three or more students were included in the analysis (N \u03ed 126 level three groups). In the supplemental materials, tables show the distribution of children across elementary and middle school teacher combinations in each district. HLM model specifications for each level of the final model appear in the appendix. First a preliminary model was specified in which Levels 2 and 3 were unconditional (i.e., no predictor variables were included at the higher levels). This model indicated that change in selfefficacy varied significantly between sixth and seventh grade, but not within grades. In other words, variance in self-efficacy trends was found between sixth and seventh grade time points, but not within school years (fall to spring). To reduce the number of iterations for the maximum likelihood algorithm, we fixed variance for the fall-spring contrast to zero, which had negligible effects on the estimation of other critical variables. From the same model, interclass correlation coefficients were calculated for variance in average levels of efficacy and change in efficacy from sixth to seventh grade time points, to estimate the variance explained by individual and group level factors. Overall, the final model accounted for 26% of the variance in average levels of self-efficacy and explained 52% of the variance in change in self-efficacy beliefs across the transition to seventh grade. Variance in average levels of self-efficacy was attributable to both within-person (47%) and between-person (52%) factors. Less than 2% of the variance in average levels of self-efficacy was between groups. However, 12% variance in the change in efficacy from sixth to seventh grade was between groups. Table 4 shows all fixed effects estimated by the HLM. Average levels of efficacy (left panel) were predicted significantly by gender, personal goals, and perceived parent goal emphases. Specifically, girls on average reported lower levels of efficacy than did boys (b \u03ed -16); and students with stronger mastery goal orientations in spring of sixth grade and/or fall of seventh grade felt significantly more self-efficient in math (b \u03ed .22, p \u03ed .000, and b \u03ed .15, p \u03ed .000, respectively). In addition, parents' mastery goal emphasis had a positive effect on students' average self-efficacy levels (b \u03ed .14, p \u03ed .000, spring sixth grade; and b \u03ed .05, p \u03ed .01, fall seventh grade). Parents' performance goal emphasis showed the expected negative trend but was only significant for the spring of sixth grade (b \u03ed -.05, p \u03ed .03).",

More specifically, we sought to demonstrate that self-efficacy beliefs, as an indicator of psychological adjustment to the learning environment in school, are sensitive to perceived changes in the classroom goal structure across the transition. HLM was used to assess the relations between change in perceived teacher goal emphasis and change in efficacy beliefs over time, taking into account students' perceptions of the goals parents emphasized in spring of sixth and fall of seventh grades. The decline in self-efficacy beliefs was most pronounced for students who perceived a lower emphasis on mastery goals in their middle school classroom compared with their experience during sixth grade of elementary school. Students who perceived an increase in mastery goal emphasis across the transition showed a significant increase in their efficacy beliefs. These effects of perceived change in the goals teachers emphasized were independent of the effects of students' perception of their parents' goal emphases. Several empirical studies within the field of achievement motivation research have documented a decline in students' motivation and achievement as they transition into higher grade levels and have linked this trend to differences in the classroom or school environments children experience. Similar trends were expected to emerge for the sample studied. However, repeated measures analyses of variance indicated that although children perceived a decline in teacher mastery emphasis across time points, students' reports of parent mastery emphasis did not change over time and remained consistently high. In addition, whereas children perceived an increase in the emphasis parents placed on performance goals, they reported a decrease between sixth and seventh grade in teacher performance goal emphasis. Middle school math teachers, contrary to expectation, were perceived as less performancefocused than elementary school math teachers.",

Accordingly, all possible patterns of change in the perceived goal emphases were observed. As Figure 3 illustrates, our findings support the theory that when students perceive a consistent emphasis on mastery goals during the transition, this serves to minimize the expected decline in the students' self-efficacy. The results of the HLM analysis also sug-gest that the teacher goal emphasis in seventh grade is of crucial importance. As late as seventh grade, teachers can substantially influence the efficacy beliefs of their students simply by placing emphasis on learning and improving understanding in mathematics, in effect ameliorating low self-efficacy beliefs that may have resulted from experiences in previous math classes. As the reverse pattern shows, the experience of a teacher who is perceived to emphasize mastery goals in sixth grade does not protect students from a dip in self-efficacy if the seventh grade teacher is perceived to be less mastery focused.",

However, different from the observed goal emphases of the teachers in which the information provided by classmates was pooled, information about the parents' goal emphasis was based solely on students' assessment of their parents and hence was prone to common-source biases. Prior studies increased our understanding of how students' personal perceptions of the classroom context relate to changes (both increases and declines) in motivation across grade level transitions (E. M. Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Urdan & Midgley, 2003) . However, they did not assess whether individual change in outcomes is accounted for by classroom-level differences in the goals that students as a group perceive teachers to emphasize, either prior to or following a grade level transition. Thus, a more general objective of the current study was to examine whether the achievement goals that children, as a group, perceived teachers to emphasize ameliorated the motivational declines typically experienced as children transition to higher grade levels, after taking personal goal orientation and perceptions of parent goal emphases into account. Although groups varied little with respect to average levels of efficacy reported across the four time points, they did vary with respect to how much efficacy changed over time. Cross-classified group membership explained 12% of the variance in change in efficacy from sixth to seventh grade. Consistent with the model proposed by Maehr and colleagues (E. M. Anderman & Maehr, 1994; Kaplan & Maehr, 2002) , changes in efficacy beliefs across the transition were predicted by changes in students' perceptions of parent mastery emphasis in sixth grade and at the group level by changes in teacher emphasis on mastery goals.",
