    "abstract": "The linkages between self-regulatory processes and achievement were examined across three years in 733 children beginning at 1 st grade (M = 6.57 years, SD = .39 at 1 st grade) who were identified as lower achieving in literacy. Accounting for consistencies in measures (from one year prior) and for influences of child's age, gender, IQ, ethnicity and economic adversity on achievement, results indicate that adaptive/effortful control at 1 st grade contributed to both academic self-efficacy beliefs at 2 nd grade, and reading (but not math) achievement at 3 rd grade. Although academic self-efficacy did not partially mediate the linkage between adaptive/effortful control and achievement, academic self-efficacy beliefs were positively correlated with reading and math. Results support the notion that early efforts to promote children's self-regulatory skills would enhance future academic selfbeliefs and achievement, particularly in literacy. Early childhood education has historically emphasized the preparation of children for the \"3 R's of school,\" or in more current terminology: literacy and math skills (Freeman & Hatch, 1989). However, there is growing consensus that social and emotional competencies enable children to succeed academically (Duncan et al., 2007; Raver & Knitzer, 2002). Despite such emerging evidence that socioemotional and self-regulatory skills contribute to achievement (Duncan et al., 2007), schools often feel pressured to de-emphasize the development of nonacademic (e.g., socioemotional and attentional) skills in the current era of standards-based accountability. Yet, academic and non-academic development are likely intertwined, and early efforts to promote children's social and emotional learning positively influence their concurrent and future academic success (e.g., Rimm-Kaufman, Fan, Chiu, & You, 2007; Zins, Bloodworth, Weissberg, & Walberg, 2004). Thus, there is little need to partition school readiness skills along academic and non-academic lines as both aspects are important for achievement (Duncan et al., 2007). The present study aims to further explore the linkages in the early elementary grades between a) non-academic self-regulatory skills, b) academic selfefficacy beliefs, and c) academic achievement. Specifically, we hypothesized that adaptive/ effortful control at 1 st grade will contribute to academic self-efficacy beliefs at 2 nd grade which, in turn, contribute to reading and/or math achievement at 3 rd grade.",

In short, such research indicates that selfefficacy beliefs serve as one of the self-regulatory mechanisms that govern a person's motivation, action, and cognitive processing (Eccles & Wigfield, 2002; Pajares, 1996; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) as well as affective processes, such as anxiety, that can hinder achievement (Bandura et al., 2003; Cervone, Kopp, Schaumann, & Scott, 1994) . For example, a capable but not very confident reader might read a passage from a book aloud to her parents at home with ease and accuracy, but struggle doing so in front of the teacher and classmates.",

For example, a child with high ego-resiliency could easily adapt and be flexible with unexpected or uncontrollable changes in the classroom schedule whereas a child with low ego-resiliency might become flustered and \"fall apart\" under similar circumstances. A child who adapts and \"bounces back\" after challenges is more likely to persist or persevere than a child who \"falls apart\" and gives up on long-term and challenging goals. Ego-resiliency is likely associated with effortful control because ego-resiliency emphasizes the flexible, adaptive, and voluntary aspects of control (Eisenberg et al., 2005; Eisenberg, Spinrad, & Morris, 2002) . Thus, we include both measures of ego-resiliency and observed effortful control in the present study. While the majority of research on ego-resiliency tends to focus on psychosocial adjustment, preliminary evidence indicates that ego-resiliency is also associated with early and later academic achievement in childhood and adolescence (Aken, 2006; Bursik & Martin, 2006; Kwok, Hughes, & Luo, 2007) .",

Their results indicate that effortful control contributed to preschool math and literacy skills (Blair & Razza, 2007) . In another study using behavioral measures of self-regulation that tapped primarily inhibitory control (but also attention and working memory), McClelland and colleagues (2007) found that preschoolers' behavioral self-regulation was associated with early math and literacy skills. Also, gains in behavioral self-regulation predicted gains in emergent literacy and math skills. In further support that effortful control contributes to achievement, Duncan and colleagues (2007) found that attention-related skills such as task persistence and self-regulation at kindergarten predicted their reading and math achievement at 3 rd grade. Thus, emerging evidence supports the view that inhibitory and effortful control contribute to academic functioning in preschoolers. However, much remains to be learned regarding the role of effortful control on school-related competencies across the elementary school years (Valiente, Lemery-Chalfant, & Castro, 2007) .",

Importantly, although effortful control and self-efficacy or perceived control both pertain to human agency, they are conceptually and theoretically distinct and do not necessarily co-occur. For example, a person can have the ability or skills for successful performance (i.e., high effortful control), but doubt their ability (i.e., have low self-efficacy) or lack the motivation to perform (e.g., under-perform or under-achieve). Conversely, a person can be overly confident when they actually lack the necessary skills for successful performance. To further delineate the two concepts, effortful control describes an individual's ability or capacity for voluntary inhibition of a primary response to activate a secondary one. In contrast, self-efficacy describes an individual's belief that they can exercise voluntary action to bring about desired goals (Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, & Pastorelli, 1996) . In the study of self-regulation, it is imperative not to confuse or equate an individual's temperament (e.g., behavioral style) with an individual's beliefs. Furthermore, there are likely temperamental and social cognitive constructs related to volition, ability, effort, persistence, and motivation that influence one another across time (Caprara, Steca, Cervone, & Artistico, 2003; Cervone, Shadel, Smith, Fiori, 2006; Lerner, 1991) .",

Approaches to learning are considered distinct, observable behaviors such as attention and persistence that indicate ways children become academically engaged or motivated (Fantuzzo et al., 2007) . Because adaptive/effortful control allows children to pay attention or follow instructions in the classroom, we expect adaptive/effortful control to contribute to successful, daily experiences in the classroom as well as to achievement. Successful experiences in the classroom will likely elicit positive feedback from teachers, parents, or peers and bolster children's academic selfefficacy beliefs. Furthermore, children who believe that they can be successful at school are likely to remain attentive and persistent in school even in the face of learning new or challenging material that ultimately contributes to academic achievement. Thus, in the present study, we test a partial mediation model by which adaptive/effortful control at 1 st grade contributes to academic self-efficacy beliefs at 2 nd grade, which then contribute to literacy or math achievement at 3 rd grade.",

Participants were relatively low achieving in literacy for their individual school districts, scoring below the median on a state approved district-administered measure of literacy taken in either May of kindergarten or September of first grade. In addition, participants spoke either English or Spanish, were not served by special education, and had not previously been retained in first grade. The sample consisted of 37% White Hispanic, 34% White non-Hispanic, 23% African American, 4% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 2% Other. At entrance to first grade, children's mean age was 6.57 (SD = .39) years. The children's IQ as measured with the Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test (Bracken & McCallum, 1998) was 92.91 (SD = 14.62). Based on family income, 61.3% of participants were eligible for free or reduced lunch. Our level of missing data appeared reasonable for a longitudinal study (Ns ranged from 733 to 621 on the major variables across the 3 years) with 85% of participants having data even for the variable with the most missing data. More importantly, across attrition analyses for each study variable, no significant differences were found between participants with and without complete data and suggest that data may be missing at random (Little & Rubin, 1987) . Due to missing data on some variables, analyses were conducted with MPLUS (v3.13, Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2004 ) that uses maximum likelihood to estimate models with missing data.",

These tasks have been found to be reliable and valid measures of inhibitory and effortful control for toddlers through early grade school children (Murray & Kochanska, 2002) and have also been used by a number of researchers examining inhibitory or effortful control and social behaviors (Dennis & Brotman, 2003; Kieras et al., 2005; Kochanska & Knaack, 2003) . In the Walk-a-Line task, children were asked to walk along a (12 ft. long by 2.5 in. wide) ribbon that was taped onto the floor. In the Star task, children were asked to use a pencil and trace geometric figures without going outside the lines of the figures (i.e., the star). Children's behaviors were observed and recorded by trained research assistants who individually administered the assessments in the schools. Research assistants received three hours of training and were tested on their knowledge of research protocol and skill in data collection prior to administrating assessments in the schools.",

Prior to inhibitory control assessment, baseline measures were assessed when children were asked to complete tasks, but without instructions to modulate or slow their behaviors. Research assistants individually timed children's behaviors using stopwatches as children completed the tasks (i.e., in real time). Because a single research assistant administered tasks for each child at the school and assessments were not video-recorded, calculations of reliability for timings used for measures of inhibitory control are not available. Scores were significantly positively correlated for inhibitory control across the two tasks at Waves 1 and 2, rs(dfs = 728 and 667) = .55 and .49, ps < .001, respectively. Similarly, the corresponding baseline responses were significantly positively correlated across the two tasks at Waves 1 and 2, rs(dfs = 728 and 569) = .29 and . 15, ps < .001, respectively. Thus, composites for inhibitory control and for baseline inhibitory control were computed by averaging the standardized scores across the 2 tasks, respectively, at Wave 1 and at Wave 2. Note that inhibitory control (not the baseline measure) was a primary variable in this study. However, we expected that the baseline measure would be directly linked to inhibitory control and thus, modeled that in our structural equation model (SEM).",

Within the Broad Reading portion of the test were three subtests that assessed children's letter-word identification, reading fluency, and passage comprehension. Similarly, the Broad Math portion of the test included three subtests to assess children's calculations, math fluency, and math calculation skills. Children whose dominant language was Spanish, based on performance on the Woodcock-Mu\u00f1oz Language Proficiency Test (2001) were administered the Bater\u00eda Woodcock-Mu\u00f1oz: Pruebas de aprovechamiento -Revisada (Bater\u00eda-R; Woodcock & Mu\u00f1oz-Sandoval, 1996) . Standard scores from the Bater\u00eda -R are considered equivalent to standard scores from the Woodcock Johnson Psychoeducational Battery-Revised (Woodcock & Johnson, 1989) , the predecessor of the WJ-III. At the time this study began, the Bater\u00eda III (Mu\u00f1oz-Sandoval, Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2005) was not yet available. In the present study, we focused on early grade school across three years, but we collected data on these children at years 4 and 5 (not included as part of the present study). However, at years 4 and 5 when the Bateria III became available, we administered both the Bater\u00eda III and the Bater\u00eda-R to a random sub-sample of 31 Spanish-dominant study participants. The two versions were very highly correlated, rs(dfs = 29) = .95 and .95, for Broad Reading and for Broad Math, respectively. Thus, results suggest that scores across the WJ III and Bateria-R are comparable in our sample and age standard scores from the WJ III or Bateria-R were used in our analyses.",

For measures at Waves 2 and 3, the structural models accounted for consistencies in all measures (from one year prior). The structural models were tested utilizing maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and a mean-adjusted chi-square statistic test (MLR; Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2004) . To account for potential dependency among the observations (children) within clusters (classrooms), analyses were conducted using the \"complex analysis\" feature in Mplus (v.3.13, Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2004) , which accounts for the nested structure of the data by adjusting the standard errors of the estimated coefficients. To assess how well the models fit the data, we included information from 3 different model fit indices (i.e., SRMR or standardized root mean square residual, CFI or comparative fit index, and RMSEA or root mean square error of approximation) as recommended by a number of methodologists (see Bentler, 2007; McDonald & Ho, 2002) . SEM with and without self-efficacy as a partial mediator-The mediational model with self-efficacy as a mediator provided good fit to the data, \u03c7 2 (23, N = 784) = 57.00, p =.00; CFI = .98; RMSEA = .04; SRMR = .02. Adaptive/effortful control was the latent construct with multiple indicators of teacher-rated ego-resiliency and observed inhibitory control, and the model-estimated loadings were significant and in the expected directions for both indicators. As recommended by the modification indices, the residual variances between math scores at Waves 2 and 3 were allowed to correlate and made theoretical sense given that they were both math tests completed by the same person. However, Sobel tests indicate that the indirect paths were not significant for W3 reading achievement (z = 1.04, ns) and W3 math achievement (z = .70, ns). We then tested a model without indirect paths which also provided good fit to the data, \u03c7 2 (23, N = 784) = 56.10, p =.00; CFI = .98; RMSEA = .04; SRMR = .02. Furthermore, chi-square difference test using the Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square (Satorra, 2000) indicated that there was no difference between models without and with indirect paths, \u03c7 2 (2) = .85, ns. Thus, we present model results without indirect paths in Figure 1 . Independent of consistencies in measures from one year prior and children's age, gender, IQ, ethnicity and economic adversity on achievement at Wave 3, model paths indicate that adaptive/effortful control at Wave 1 was predictive of academic self-efficacy at Wave 2 and reading achievement at Wave 3 (Figure 1 ).",

Our findings demonstrate that adaptive/effortful control at 1 st grade contributed to positive academic self-efficacy beliefs at 2 nd grade, and contributed to literacy (but not math) two years later. Although academic self-efficacy did not partially mediate the linkage between adaptive/effortful control and achievement in the early grades, academic self-efficacy beliefs were associated with high literacy and math at Waves 1 and 2 (see Table 3 ; also see Denissen et al., 2007; Wigfield et al., 2006; Zimmerman et al., 1992) . Importantly, although we found that Wave 2 academic self-efficacy was positively correlated with Wave 3 reading and math, above contributions from covariates (i.e., age, gender, IQ, ethnicity and economic adversity) and Wave 1 adaptive/effortful control, Wave 2 academic self-efficacy did not make an independent contribution to Wave 3 reading. Overall, our findings are consistent with the notion (e.g., Pajares, 2005, p. 353 ) that early self-regulatory abilities and skills appear to foster both school-related confidence and competence in the early grades.",

Because effortful control is an aspect of temperament that contributes to attention, effort, and persistence, it is not surprising that early effortful control would contribute to later academic self-efficacy beliefs (Bandura et al., 1996; Denissen et al., 2007; Fantuzzo et al., 2007) .

Given the social nature of group work, children need to use their social and emotional skills (e.g., waiting or turn-taking, managing conflict or disappointment, and cooperation). Thus, children who are able to inhibit their impulses and recover from set-backs (i.e., exhibit adaptive and effortful control) are likely able to adapt well to learning in group settings. In early reading instruction, children are often organized into small groups and asked to take turns reading aloud in a roundrobin or otherwise fashion while the teacher assesses each student's progress and offers immediate feedback. The use of small groups in reading instruction (in comparison to typical mathematics instruction) is effective for the oral nature of early reading and allows for timely assessment. However, this practice also highlights the need for children to demonstrate adaptive and effortful control.",

Therefore, mathematics instruction is generally whole class instruction followed by independent \"seat work\" that is more self-paced in nature. However, that is not to say that mathematics or individualized work does not require self-regulatory skills. Rather, independent work might emphasize a different set of self-regulatory skills such as selfmonitoring and staying on-task compared to group work that might emphasize recovery from set-back and peer conflicts, waiting, and turn-taking. Thus, as suggested by our findings, the mechanisms that involve self-regulation and self-efficacy underlying reading achievement across the early school grades likely differ from that for math achievement.",

Although not always feasible, future studies that are conducted in naturalistic settings such as schools could videorecord participants during assessments to allow for fine-grained data coding and calculations of reliabilities on observed measures. Importantly, our measures of inhibitory control and egoresiliency were significantly, albeit moderately, positively correlated with one another. Thus, our measure of inhibitory control appears to be a reasonable measure of adaptive/effortful regulatory processes. Of interest is that our measures of inhibitory control and academic selfefficacy beliefs were not significantly associated with one another. Thus, adaptive/effortful control contributes to academic self-efficacy beliefs but the contribution might be primarily from ego-resiliency. Future research could focus on differentiating the roles of specific selfregulatory components that contribute to specific aspects of learning and achievement. Because our sample were children selected on the basis of scoring below the median on a measure of literacy at entrance to 1 st grade, caution should be taken in the interpretation and generalization of findings. Recall that adaptive/effortful control at 1 st grade continued to predict reading (but not math) achievement two years later. Future studies could examine if a similar finding is found for math in a sample of students who are lower achieving in math (rather than literacy) skills. Furthermore, is it important to examine if such relations between effortful control, academic self-efficacy beliefs, and achievement operate similarly for non-low achieving students. Finally, our potential explanations for why adaptive and effortful control at 1 st grade predicted literacy, but not math, achievement at 3 rd grade were derived from national trends in instruction rather than from direct classroom observations. Future studies could consider how adaptive/effortful control and self-efficacy beliefs operate on achievement in conjunction with contextual factors such as classroom practices.",

Thus, preschool and early childhood programs that help students develop emotional and behavioral self-regulatory skills (while also teaching early literacy skills) will be most effective in developing a literate society. One example of school-based programs to enhance children's self-regulatory skills is the PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies) curriculum which has shown success in sustained improvements on children's social and emotional adjustment (Greenberg et al., 2004; Greenberg et al., 1995) while simultaneously fostering pre-K literacy development. Recent educational practices toward high-stakes, standardized testing may place an even greater premium on learners to pay attention, inhibit their impulses, and to bounce back after set-backs (Johnston, 2005) . Additionally, students may benefit from evaluations of their academic self-efficacy beliefs in order to identify students who may be at risk for academic challenges. Recall that academic self-efficacy was positively correlated with reading and math achievement within and across time. However, there are relatively few validated methods to assess children's self-efficacy and motivation for reading at the early grades (McTigue, Beckman, & Kadervak, 2007) which provides an area warranting additional research. Our results add to a growing body of research indicating that students' socio-emotional factors influence literacy outcomes. Furthermore, our findings highlight the bridge between developmental or educational research and effective educational practice by offering teachers concrete and applicable information to enhance children's academic self-beliefs and achievement.
