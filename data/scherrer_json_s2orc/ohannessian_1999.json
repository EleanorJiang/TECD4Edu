This is unfortunate since recent research (cf., Kashani and Orvaschel, 1990) has indicated that anxiety may be even more common than depression during adolescence. In addition, similar to depression, it is clear that the experience of anxiety increases during adolescence (Clark et al., 1994; Ebata et al., 1990) . Conservative prevalence estimates indicate that about 16% of young adolescents (12-year-olds), 17% of middle adolescents (14\u00b116-year-olds), and 21% of late adolescents (17-year-olds) meet the criteria necessary to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (Kashani and Orvaschel, 1990) . Importantly, a larger majority of adolescents experience mild to moderate levels of anxiety which also may negatively affect their development (Ohannessian et al., 1996) .",

What is most intriguing about the gender difference in emotional problems is that it is absent during childhood (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990; Brooks-Gunn and Petersen, 1991; Cohen et al., 1993) . 1 One important question, therefore, is when do these gender differences emerge? Presently, the answer to this question is unclear. Most of the research within this area conducted to date has focused on middleto-late adolescents. Research focusing on these age groups has consistently demonstrated that adolescent girls are more likely to experience depression and anxiety (symptomatology and clinical disorders) than are adolescent boys (cf., Brooks-Gunn, 1991; Petersen et al., 1991; . It is important to note, however, that some studies examining younger adolescents (11\u00b112-year-olds) have found the same pattern of results, indicating that even early adolescent females may be more at-risk for depression and anxiety than early adolescent males (Kandel and Davies, 1986; Ohannessian et al., 1996) . These latter studies point to the critical need to assess youngsters as early as late childhood to determine when this gender difference consistently emerges.",

For example, research has shown that girls are more likely than are boys to use ruminative coping techniques (Compas et al., 1993; . During early adolescence, girls also have been found to have more negative body images in comparison to boys (Simmons and Blyth, 1987; Allgood-Merten et al., 1990) . In turn, ruminative coping and having a negative body image have been linked to depression (Brooks-Gunn, 1988; Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 1993) . Consistent with these \u00aendings, during adolescence, girls with less masculine sex-role behaviors have been found to be more likely to experience depressive symptomatology than girls with more masculine sex-role behaviors (Obeidallah et al., 1994) .",

Second, using longitudinal data, one needs to demonstrate that there are signi\u00aecant gender differences in depression and/or anxiety during adolescence. Third, the predictor variable being examined (e.g. perceptions of the self ) must be shown to be signi\u00aecantly associated with the dependent variable(s) (depression or anxiety). Finally, gender differences in the predictor variable must be shown to occur prior to gender differences in the dependent variable(s) (see Nolen-Hoeksema and Girgus, 1994, for a more detailed discussion of these criteria). If all of these criteria are met, the predictor variable may be said to at least partially account for gender differences in the dependent variable being assessed.",

The results for girls and boys are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. As shown, all but a few of these correlations were negative. Table 2 , higher levels of academic competence and selfworth (at Time 2) were consistently associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety for girls. Higher levels of physical appearance at both times of measurement also were negatively correlated with trait anxiety at Time 2. Finally, higher levels of athletic competence at Time 2 were related to lower levels of state anxiety at Time 1. These correlations suggest that girls with higher levels of self-competence are less likely to be anxious and/or depressed than girls with lower levels of self-competence. 4 The signi\u00aecant gender difference in trait anxiety between boys and girls at Time 2 appears to be due to an increase in anxiety for girls between Time 1 and Time 2. This increase is consistent with the literature suggesting that anxiety tends to increase during early adolescence, especially for girls (Ebata et al., 1990) . In contrast, the gender difference in depression at Time 2 appears to be due to a decrease in depression for boys between Time 1 and Time 2. Although this \u00aending may not seem intuitive at \u00aerst, this pattern of results is consistent with studies that have found an increase in emotional adjustment for boys as they enter puberty and subsequently develop more muscle mass and better body images (Crockett and Petersen, 1987) . Results for boys. Similar to the results for girls, higher levels of self-worth were signi\u00aecantly associated with lower levels of depression and state anxiety at Time 2 for boys. In addition, higher levels of perceived physical appearance, social competence, and academic competence at both times of measurement were related to lower levels of emotional adjustment (see Table 3 ). Again, these results indicate that boys with higher levels of selfcompetence are less depressed and/or anxious than are boys with lower levels of selfcompetence.",

Three additional ANOVAs were then conducted, covarying self-worth, physical appearance, and athletic competence in the models, respectively. When self-worth was entered as a covariate, gender no longer signi\u00aecantly predicted depression [F(1)=2\u00c179, p=0\u00c1100].

To summarize, gender no longer signi\u00aecantly predicted depression in all of the models when a self-competence measures was entered as a covariate. These results suggest that self-competence (speci\u00aecally self-worth, perceived physical appearance, and athletic competence) at least partially accounts for the gender differences in depression during early adolescence. In addition to these analyses, more stringent tests were conducted to determine whether the amount of variance explained signi\u00aecantly increased when the covariates were included. In these analyses, the models including self-worth and physical appearance did not signi\u00aecantly differ from the original model predicting depression from gender only [F(1, 67)=71\u00c114, p=n.s.; and F(1, 67)=71\u00c107, p=n.s., respectively]. In contrast, the model including athletic competence as a covariate did signi\u00aecantly differ from the model predicting depression from gender only [F(1, 67)=4\u00c146, p50\u00c105]. These results further support the \u00aending that athletic competence partially contributes to the emergence of gender differences in depression during early adolescence.",

Three additional ANOVAs were again calculated entering self-worth, physical appearance, and athletic competence as covariates, respectively.

Gender also continued to be a signi\u00aecant predictor in this model [F(1)=4\u00c104, p=0\u00c1048], although the relationship between gender and trait anxiety was attenuated by the inclusion of physical appearance in the model. Finally, the inclusion of athletic competence in the ANOVA did not appear to have a substantial in\u00afuence on the relationship between gender and trait anxiety. In this model, gender still had a strong and signi\u00aecant in\u00afuence on trait anxiety [F(1)=6\u00c136, p50\u00c1014]. To summarize, the results from these analyses indicated that self-competence (self-worth and perceived physical appearance) somewhat weakened the relationship between gender and trait anxiety. Although the ANOVA models remained marginally signi\u00aecant, these effects must be considered in relation to the fact that the power was limited since the sample was quite small.",

Similar, although not as striking, results were found for trait anxiety since the relationship between gender and trait anxiety diminished, but remained signi\u00aecant, when the self-competence variables were covaried in the ANOVA models. These results are consistent with those found by Allgood-Merten et al.
