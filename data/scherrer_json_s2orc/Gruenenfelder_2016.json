    "abstract": "A large body of literature suggests a clear, concurrent association between peer approval and self-esteem in adolescence. However, little empirical work exists on either the prospective or reciprocal relation between peer approval and self-esteem during this age period. Moreover, it is unclear from past research whether both subjectively perceived peer approval and objectively measured peer approval are related to subsequent self-esteem over time (and vice versa) and whether these paths have long-term associations into adulthood. Using data from a large longitudinal study that covers a time span of 2 decades, we examined reciprocal, prospective relations between self-esteem and peer approval during ages 12-16 in addition to long-term relations between these variables and later social constructs at age 35. Cross-lagged regression analyses revealed small but persistent effect sizes from both types of peer approval to subsequent self-esteem in adolescence, controlling for prior self-esteem. However, effects in the reverse direction were not confirmed. These findings support the notion that peer relationships serve an important function for later self-esteem, consistent with many theoretical tenets of the importance of peers for building a strong identity. Finally, we found long-term relations between adult social constructs and adolescent objective and subjective peer approval as well as self-esteem. Therefore, not only do peer relationships play a role in self-esteem development across adolescence, but they remain impactful throughout adulthood. In sum, the current findings highlight the lasting, yet small link between peer relationships and self-esteem development and call for investigations of further influential factors for self-esteem over time.",

Although relatively stable, self-esteem is best understood as a construct that goes through significant changes across the entire life span (Harter, 1999; Robins, Trzesniewski, Tracy, Gosling, & Potter, 2002) . On average, self-esteem tends to be high in childhood, declines substantially during adolescence, rises throughout adulthood, peaks, and becomes more stable in middle adulthood and declines again in old age Robins et al., 2002) . This age trajectory has been interpreted as representing normative developmental changes; for example, the drop in adolescent selfesteem has been hypothesized to be a consequence of the social (e.g., shifts in social networks), physical (e.g., hormonal and weight changes), cognitive (e.g., formal operational reasoning), and psychological (e.g., increasing autonomy) changes typically occurring throughout this developmental period Harter, 1999; Robins et al., 2002; .",

Most important, there are large variations in adolescent self-esteem trajectories, suggesting strong interindividual differences in self-esteem development over time (Donnellan, Trzesniewski, Conger, & Conger, 2007; Steiger, Allemand, Robins, & Fend, 2014; Trzesniewski, Donnellan, & Robins, 2003) . Given that the average drop of self-esteem in adolescence occurs in tandem with substantial interindividual differences in intraindividual self-esteem development, the next logical step is to ask what drives adolescent self-esteem development.",

If members of a relevant social group appreciate one's relational value, then self-esteem should also be high. According to the theory, changes in self-esteem have evolved to monitor how much one is valued by members of a desirable group; this process has the purpose of adjusting one's behavior to maintain further approval or prevent future disapproval of these members. The supposed cause of this drive has been suggested to lie in our ancestors' higher likelihood of survival if they were well integrated in a social group (Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Thomaes et al., 2010) . In support of this notion, many researchers have shown that others' appraisals impact individuals' self-evaluations (Boudreault-Bouchard et al., 2013; Cole, Jacquez, & Maschman, 2001; Felson & Zielinski, 1989; Srivastava & Beer, 2005) .",

First, adolescents face a transitional social context with its increasing independence from parents and greater orientation toward and concern for same-aged peers (e.g., Erikson, 1968; Harter, 1999; Laible, Carlo & Roesch, 2004) . Next, peer relationships develop along a voluntary basis, are terminable, and therefore bear a risk of exclusion at any point during the friendship (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Allen & Land, 1999; Asendorpf, 1989; Buhrmester, 1990; Fend, 1998) . As a consequence, feelings of (social) inadequacy, loneliness or social isolation are likely to be predominant in peer relationships, which may in turn influence self-perceptions of worthiness and the construction of a positive model of the self. In sum, peer relationships are likely to be a powerful source of self-esteem development in adolescence.",

As for peer relationships predicting self-esteem over time, peer victimization was negatively related to 9-to-11-year-olds' self-esteem across five measurement occasions (Troop-Gordon & Ladd, 2005 ), suggesting that children who are rejected by peers may acquire self-defeating attributions of being socially incompetent and unworthy. Similarly, children who perceived themselves as socially competent tended to report higher overall self-esteem three years later (Hymel, Rubin, Rowden, & LeMare, 1990) ; however, children's prior self-esteem was not taken into account and could have at least partially contributed to the link with later self-esteem. Speaking to this prospect, in two other studies, age 12 subjective peer social support and popularity predicted age 17 global selfworth even after controlling for prior global self-worth (Asendorpf & van Aken, 2003; Reitz, Motti-Stefanidi, & Asendorpf, 2015) . Finally, undergraduate university students who participated in four weekly group meetings with other unfamiliar students tended to say they liked themselves more after the others had previously reported (to the researchers) that they liked those students (Srivastava & Beer, 2005) . Therefore, there is some evidence to support the idea that peer relationships might determine self-esteem levels and trajectories across adolescence.",

However, it is limited in that no one to our knowledge has prospectively linked peer approval and selfesteem across more than two time points in adolescence. Rather, some researchers have done so at age periods besides adolescence. Because adolescents are faced with the developmental task of forming a coherent view of the self and establishing a place in their social network (Erikson, 1968; Fend, 1994) , their self-esteem might be related to previous liking by others. In contrast to somewhat older college students with a more developed sense of self, however, they might display less consistent social cues signaling their self-esteem. That is, adolescent self-views may be dependent on peer approval but not vice versa.",

Further, adolescents begin to engage in abstract thinking and start to evaluate themselves on a variety of life domains, including their social roles and integration in peer groups (Harter, 1999; Fend, 1998; Troop-Gordon & Ladd, 2005) . Following this line of reasoning, we argue that subjective evaluations of peer approval is an important characteristic of peer relationships to include in any study investigating relations between peer approval and self-esteem in adolescence.",

Based on these nominations from their peers, the target individual's position in his or her respective social group is inferred. According to Fend (1998) and Specht (1982) , likability and reputation (i.e., prestige) have proven to effectively reflect two important aspects of one's standing in a peer group. First, they reflect the affective dimension of social integration by means of sympathy, likability, and friendliness. Second, they reflect whether a target is able to receive attention and shape the group's dynamic, and thus, they represent how highly regarded and respected the target is by other members of his or her group (Fend, 1998) .",

The longitudinal link is important to examine because when there are links between predictors and criteria that are both subjective, as in some literature described above, some of the effect may be due to shared method variance. Including objective predictors of such criteria could help account for this possibility and thus speak to the robustness and generalizability of such effects.

Theoretically, adolescence is often described as a unique developmental age period with regard to the social domain (as described above) as well as a time of increased vulnerability for the onset of later social and emotional adaptation problems Erikson, 1968; Steinberg, 2005) . In addition, selfesteem can be regarded as a personality characteristic that is associated with specific information processing patterns (Kuster, Orth, & Meier, 2012) , potentially leading to similarities within individuals in reactions to social situations across the life span (Kern, Della Porta, & Friedman, 2013) . Individuals with low self-esteem may be more sensitive to social evaluations and social feedback than those with high self-esteem (Brockner's plasticity hypothesis ; Brockner, 1988) . Therefore, it is likely that individuals with low self-esteem do not act as securely and confidently in their friendship networks, and as a result might develop lowered feelings of social integration and/or social support in adulthood. As for peer approval during adolescence, lack of approval might lead to a specific sensitivity to social rejection, spurring a vicious circle for later friendship development and resulting in objective (e.g., number of friends, relationship status) and/or subjective lower social integration and social support. Finally, feelings of peer approval and being socially integrated in a same age peer group might help adolescents to shape and practice \"(. . .) skills and competencies to navigate the social complexities of adult life\" (Allemand et al., 2015, p. 3) .",

It is possible that the \"subjective reality\" in adolescence can inform the \"subjective reality\" in adulthood (i.e., feeling integrated in an adolescent peer group would be related to feeling integrated in a circle of friends in adulthood). However, adolescent subjective perceptions might not be relevant for objective adult outcomes (e.g., relationship status, number of friends). For example, some people might feel socially integrated from just having one close friend. Objective peer approval measures (e.g., the number of peer nominations of popularity), on the other hand, might be more relevant for objective adult outcomes because objectively popular individuals likely find a relationship partner and friends more easily, as these occurrences might perpetuate over time, ensuring that popular adolescents continue to profit from their popularity later in life. Therefore, in the current study, we also tested whether adolescent peer approval and self-esteem are related to subjective and objective social outcomes in adulthood.",

The study sample was originally recruited via participation of schools from the city of Frankfurt and two rural areas in the region of Hessen in West Germany during the years 1979 to 1983 (for details see Fend, 1990 Fend, , 1994 . Schools were chosen according to the representative percentage of students within each school level (lower, medium and upper level of secondary education). This procedure led to an adolescent sample that was broadly representative of the Western German population with regard to socioeconomic status, gender, ethnic origin, urban versus rural place of residence, and education level (see Fend, Berger, & Grob, 2009 , for further details).",

In addition, compared with the Western German population with 34.2% individuals holding a secondary school Level I certificate with medium requirements, a higher percentage (42.3%) of the adult study participants had received such a certificate. Finally, with regard to the highest education level (university entrance diploma), the percentage of individuals (39.2%) who had received this degree was comparable to the Western German population (41.0%; for more details see Fend et al., 2009) .

They were then asked to nominate up to five school peers they liked most (indicator of social likability/popularity). Additionally, they were given a second sheet and were asked to again nominate up to five peers that-in their eyes-were highly respected among the classmates (indicator of prestige/reputation). Students' nominations were then counted by including direct (Peer A is nominated by Peer B; B \u00a1 A nomination) and indirect nominations (Peer A was nominated by Peer B who was in turn also nominated by Peer C; C \u00a1 B \u00a1 A; C-B indirect nomination is taken into account) and summed to create a weighted score for direct and indirect nominations (Coleman, 1964) . We allocated a score of 0.5 for direct nominations and then quadratically reduced the score for every indirect nomination (0.5 2 ), with more distal nominations being quadratically reduced again (0.5 3 , 0.5 4 , and so forth). The inclusion of both direct and indirect nominations takes into account the varying degrees and kinds of \"connectedness\" in the social structure of individuals, revealing the hierarchical structure among group members (Coleman, 1964, p. 444) . That is, the indirect nominations were included because they represent the popularity of the nominators themselves. If somebody is only nominated by peers who do not receive any nominations, this would lead to a lower score for an individual compared to a different individual who received the same number of direct nominations from peers who themselves receive a greater number of nominations. We illustrate the calculation method in the following example for the score of a hypothetical Peer A: a direct nomination of Peer A through Peer B counted as 0.5. If Peer B had been nominated by another Peer C, this indicated a first indirect choice and was counted with a quadratic reduction of the direct choice 0.5 2 . Second indirect nominations (Peer D nominated Peer C) were again quadratically reduced and counted as 0.5 3 (and so forth). These direct and indirect scores were then summed, multiplied by 10, and rounded to avoid decimal places. Therefore, hypothetical Peer A in the mentioned example would have received a score of 0.5 \u03e9 0.5 2 \u03e9 0.5 3 \u202b\u0621\u202c 10 \u03ed 8.75 \u00a1 rounded up to 9. The last measurement wave in adolescence (age 16) was omitted due to completion of compulsory education by a vast amount of participants (41.7%). These participants had completed the compulsory nine years of schooling (in Germany, students in the low and medium education levels called Hauptschule and Realschule finish after year 9 and start an apprenticeship or a different form of professional training at age 16). Thus, they had left their school class context, transitioning to professional training that then contained a wide variety of new education class structures. We therefore used data from the first four measurement occasions only (ages 12-15). Subjective social support (age 35). An established scale with four items indicating the presence and perceived strength of social support was given to the adult sample (Bien, Donald Bender, Mittag, & Brislinger, 1988 . Items were: \"There are many people I can count on when I have problems,\" \"I have plenty of people that I feel strongly connected with,\" \"When I need my friends, I can always count on them,\" and \"There are many people I trust.\" Participants rated each item on a 6-point Likert-type scale (1 \u03ed does not apply to me at all, 6 \u03ed fully applies to me). The composite scores ranged from 4 to 24 with higher scores indicating higher perceptions of social support. Cronbach's alpha for this scale was \u2423 \u03ed .86.",

Declarations of over 10 close friends were very rare (less than 5% of all participants). Indeed, most participants re-2 The calculation model proposed by Coleman takes into account the varying degrees and kinds of \"connectedness\" in the social structures they are meant to characterize (Coleman, 1964, p. 434) . His approach aims at detecting hierarchization within groups of people and unraveling if and how relations within a social group are interdependent. Therefore, not only direct peer nominations but also indirect peer nominations are estimated and weighted for each individual (i.e., indirect nominations count less than direct nominations. As a rule to weigh direct and indirect nominations we assigned 0.5 points for direct nominations and quadratically reduced every indirect nominations, taking into account the varying degrees of distance from the target peer. When calculating the score for person X, all paths leading to this person X were listed and then calculated according to this rule classes. (for further reading on the social connectedness within sociograms, we recommend Coleman, 1964, p .432ff.) 3 A potential critique could refer to the theoretical and empirical overlap between social integration and social support. However, social integration and social support are typically defined as two related yet distinct constructs of social relations. Whereas social integration is typically defined as participation in social relationships and associated with perceived presence or absence of companionship and loneliness (Brissette, Cohen, & Seeman, 2000) , social support grasps a somewhat different aspect of social bonds, namely, how reliable and supportive these interpersonal relations are and whether there is instrumental or emotional support when one has a problem or a certain need. That is, social support refers to the provision of resources from social networks (Cohen, 2004) . However, in our sample the correlation of the latent constructs of social integration and social support is rather high (r \u03ed .71) and we therefore conducted a factor analysis in order to test whether the two constructs are better combined or separated in our final models. Our results suggest that social integration and social support capture two different aspects of social relations. Each of the constructs showed sufficient explained variance, with the three items of social integration and the four items of social support loading on two different factors (eigenvalues \u03fe1, factor 1: explained variance 56.3%, factor 2: explained variance 15.0%). Furthermore, the model fits worsened significantly when we modeled the items for social support and social integration on only one general social factor instead of two latent factors.

Still, as to expect with longitudinal studies, there was substantial missing data over the course of the 19 years of investigation. We chose to maximize power and generalizability by including every participant who reported at least one self-esteem or peer approval item at any time point and by employing full-information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML) to handle missing values (see Table 1 for a scale-level report of missing values). The default setting FIML in MPlus assumes that missing data is random across time and unrelated to the constructs of interest. Indeed, the study members who participated at all three assessments did not differ from the original adolescent sample on any of the key variables of interest (see Fend et al., 2009 for detailed attrition analysis). Compared with other approaches dealing with missing data, the main advantage of the FIML approach is that every variable in the analysis model is taken into account in dealing with missing information, thus, maximizing the probability of observing what has, de facto, been observed (Allison, 2012) .",

We examined whether peer approval prospectively predicts subsequent selfesteem (and vice versa) over a time span of 5 years, between ages 12 and 16. Our findings indicated that there were small, yet persistent effects from both types of peer approval on subsequent self-esteem, when controlling for prior levels of self-esteem over time. These results are in line with sociometer theory and with empirical evidence suggesting that the peer context serves as an influential source of self and identity development in adolescence (Allen & Land, 1999; Buhrmester & Furman, 1986; Laible, Carlo, & Roesch, 2004; Fend, 1998; Harter, 1999) . 5 With regard to the control variables, in the subjective peer approval to self-esteem model, we found females to report higher social support (\u2424 \u03ed .15, p \u03fd .001) and a small effect in favor of females over males with regard to social integration (\u2424 \u03ed .07, p \u03fd .05). Furthermore, age 16 feelings of loneliness were clearly related to lower adult social integration (\u2424 \u03ed \u03ea.14, p \u03fd .01) and social support (\u2424 \u03ed \u03ea.11, p \u03fd .01) at age 35. In the objective peer approval to self-esteem model, we found similar effects of gender on social support (\u2424 \u03ed .16, p \u03fd .001) and social integration (\u2424 \u03ed .08, p \u03fd .01) and an effect of age 16 feelings of loneliness (\u2424 \u03ed \u03ea.19, p \u03fd .001) on adult subjective social integration and on social support (\u2424 \u03ed \u03ea.16, p \u03fd .001).

                "text": "larity (number of \"liked\" nominations received) and prestige (number of \"opinion leader\" nominations received) of target individuals. In our view, these two perspectives complement each other. Subjective perceptions of peer acceptance have been suggested to be \"central to the study of interpersonal relationships\" (Furman, 1996, p. 41) . They can be regarded as an ideal measure of peer approval because it might matter most how individuals actually feel when they think of their peers. However, subjective perceptions of peer (dis)approval can be biased due to recent social activities, conflicts, or the social structures in which individuals are embedded. Thus, objective ratings of peer acceptance may profit from less biased popularity ratings, especially if the applied method takes into account both direct and indirect nominations. Such a measure can capture a more impartial reflection of a social structure within a group of individuals (e.g., school class, clique) and may be more adequate when researchers are interested in actual rather than subjective occurrences of social approval or when researchers might assume that subjects may under or overestimate themselves (e.g., in the case of personality pathology, inability of unbiased self-report due to very young or very old age, mental disorder). Therefore, given the strengths and limitations of each measure of peer approval, we recommend other researchers continue to consider both perspectives when feasible. We acknowledge that administration of both types of peer relationship measures may not be feasible, especially given the greater planning, organization, and participant cooperation required when collecting sociometric data (see Fend, 1990) . Therefore, if subjective measures are chosen over objective, we would first like to emphasize that our current findings (i.e., subjective and objective peer acceptance had similar effect sizes) should not be taken to imply that other associations only measured subjectively would necessarily replicate with objective measures. It happened in the current study that subjective analyses were generalizable to the objective \"reality,\" but there are other areas that we expect this may not be the case. For example, sociometrically popular fourth grade girls do not differ in perceived friendship quality (Lansford et al., 2006) , but sociometrically unpopular seventh and eighth graders rate themselves high on popularity (Parkhurst & Hopmeyer, 1998) . Furthermore, differences across self versus other perspectives are related to personality characterizations such as dominance and aggressiveness (Parkhurst & Hopmeyer, 1998) , so in studies on these traits, it is likely best to use both subjective and objective measures.",

These findings are in line with research suggesting that subjective social support or social skills serve as predictors of subsequent social outcomes in adulthood (Allemand et al., 2015; Kinnunen, Feldt, Kinnunen, & Pulkkinen, 2008) . Objectively measured peer approval in adolescence, however, was not related to subjective adult social integration or support in adulthood. It could be that the different social networks from adolescence to adulthood are actually similar in subjective appraisals (i.e., perceptions of school relationships influence perceptions of adult social networks), whereas objective evaluations of popularity or prestige at school do not transfer to other relationships over time. The null effect could also have been caused by the different reporters of objective approval and later subjective social outcomes. Or, it could be that subjective perceptions are more influential over the long-term due to being internalized and expressed either consciously or unconsciously during later social interactions.",

The actual higher popularity and prestige during adolescence may have been sustained into adulthood, making these individuals de facto more attractive for a relationship. On the other hand, we did not find an effect from either subjective or objective peer approval on the reported number of friends in adulthood. This may be because simply asking for the target's number of friends is not ideally construed insofar as each individual may define the term \"friends\" differently and thus include different types of friendships in their count (see Demir, Ozdemir, & Weitekamp, 2007) or an inflated number of friendships. Researchers recommend considering other characteristics of friendships as well, including reciprocity of nomination, quality, satisfaction, and even conflict (see Parker & Asher, 1993) . It is possible that subjective or objective peer approval in adolescence would be related to one of these additional measures rather than number of friends in adulthood.",

First, we were unable to test the long-term effects of adolescent self-esteem and peer approval on adult self-esteem because self-esteem was not measured at age 35. It would have been interesting to test whether adolescent peer approval prospectively predicts adult self-esteem, controlling for adolescent selfesteem. For example, this would inform whether the proposals of sociometer theory hold over the long-term. Future studies should build upon the current results to test this longitudinal effect. Further, after controlling for age 16 feelings of loneliness, selfesteem showed a long-term predictive effects on later social integration at age 35 only in the objective peer approval-self-esteem model. In the subjective peer approval-self-esteem model, adolescent self-esteem did not predict any of the social outcomes variables in adulthood. The fact that the long-term prospective effect from self-esteem on later social outcomes was only present in the objective peer approval-self-esteem model led us to conclude that shared method variance between self-reported self-esteem and self-reported subjective social outcomes was, at least partly, responsible for the observed effect in this model. Second, in the present study we could not test the influence of out-of-school peers-that is, friends from sports or leisure activities, or other settings that take place outside of the school context-on self-esteem over time. Note, however, that inclusion of this social group would have been unlikely to distort our findings regarding in-school peers because classmates are typically considered to be the most influential form of peer approval, as adolescents spend the majority of their time in this context (Fend, 1998; Harter, 1999) .",

Finally, we only looked at one sample (West Germany, age 12 to age 35) at one given time point in history (1979 -1983 and 2002) . It is highly likely that peer influences may be stronger in cultures with a more individualistic orientation (such as Germany) compared with cultures that are more collectivistic (such as Taiwan), and/or family oriented (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) . However, at least from the historical time dependency, when comparing the current adolescent sample (historical time 1979 -1983) with the follow-up sample from the same (ongoing) study (historical time: 2012), we did not find a difference in the association between self-esteem and subjective peer acceptance (across all years and both samples, r \u03ed .40 -.54). With regard to cultural dependency, we compared a sample of Turkish (N \u03ed 84), Southern Europeans (N \u03ed 80), and German youth (N \u03ed 10,204; total sample: N \u03ed 11,147 from the German evaluation of comprehensive schools study) in a similar historical time (1977) on the association between subjective peer approval and self-esteem (r \u03ed .37-.59) and did not find a significant difference between the cultural subsamples.",

                "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has tested reciprocal and prospective links between subjectively and objectively measured peer approval and self-esteem over 5 years during adolescence. We used advanced statistical modeling for longitudinal data to correct for measurement errors and stability effects within each of the tested constructs (autoregressive latent cross-lagged effects) and a large sample to test our assumptions. Additionally, we tested long-term prospective effects of adolescent self-esteem and peer approval on adult social outcomes; that is, we included different developmental periods from adolescence to early adulthood. Many theories exist regarding sources of selfesteem across the life span (e.g., sociometer, reflected appraisal), but empirical support is mixed. The small but persistent effects of adolescent subjective and objective peer approval on self-esteem change contributes to the existing empirical understanding of the role of peer approval in adolescent self-esteem development. We believe that the application of two different perspectives (objective and subjective) of peer approval and the 5-year time span studied across adolescence is a unique contribution to the field. We showed that both types of peer approval measures were relevant for this adolescent sample, and we encourage future researchers to also apply both measures if feasible. While our procedure advances prior knowledge on the relative importance of both types of measures for subsequent self-esteem, it would be interesting to see whether these peer approval measures are more suited for certain samples (e.g., samples with personality pathology, samples with biased self-views). Additionally, our thorough test of reciprocal associations between peer approval and subsequent self-esteem took into account prior levels of both constructs, which is a major advantage when trying to understand antecedents of change, and which is a technique that is somewhat lacking in the adolescent self-esteem development field.",

First, peers-independent of whether they are only 12 or already 16-years-old-serve to influence self-esteem and thus, inform identity formation. Second, both subjective evaluations of how integrated an individual feels and objective evaluations of how integrated an individual actually is play a crucial role for self-esteem development. For practitioners working in the field of social relations during adolescence (such as mobbing, cyberbullying, etc.) this finding might be an interesting starting point for applied work, insofar as subjective evaluations of peer integration typically involve self-disclosure whereas objective evaluations are more easily observable. Finally, with regard to our long-term findings, we could show that self-esteem is integral for later adjustment; that is, the process of adolescent self-esteem development through peers and relevant others will reveal consequences still decades later. Thus, our findings have important implications for self and identity development as we could show that adolescence represents a vulnerable age period to peer influences but also acts as a time period that is integral for long-term adjustment.",
