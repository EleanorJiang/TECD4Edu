    "abstract": "This article presents results from a 3-year longitudinal study of the growth patterns and correlates of perceived discrimination by adults and by peers among Black, Latino, and Asian American high school students. Results revealed a linear increase over time in levels of perceived discrimination by adults, whereas perceptions of discrimination by peers remained stable over time. Asian American and non-Puerto Rican Latino adolescents (primarily Dominican) reported higher levels of peer and/or adult discrimination than did Puerto Rican youth, whereas Black adolescents reported a steeper increase over time in levels of perceived discrimination by peers and by adults than did Puerto Rican adolescents. Peer and adult discrimination was significantly associated with decreased self-esteem and increased depressive symptoms over time. Ethnic identity and ethnicity were found to moderate the relationships between perceived discrimination and changes in psychological well-being over time. Results underscore the need to include perceptions of discrimination when studying the development and well-being of ethnic minority adolescents.",

Black, Latino, and Asian American young people regularly experience race-or ethnicity-based verbal and physical harassment and, in the case of Blacks and Latinos, low expectations from adults in employment and school contexts. Although the prevalence of race-or ethnicity-based harassment for young people of color has been documented extensively over the past 3 decades (Fine, 1991; Ladner, 1971; MacLeod, 1987) , it is only recently that researchers have begun to explore the implications of discriminatory experiences for development (Garcia Coll et al., 1996; Tatum, 1997) . The small but growing body of research in this area has, for the most part, focused on the ways in which experiences of perceived discrimination are associated with psychological functioning (e.g., Fisher et al., 2000; Wong, Eccles, & Sameroff, 2003) as well as potential moderators (e.g., ethnic identity) of these associations (e.g., Caldwell, Kohn-Wood, Schmeelk-Cone, Chavous, & Zimmerman, 2004; Wong et al., 2003) .",

First and foremost, as the extant research on discrimination has been largely cross-sectional (e.g., Fisher et al., 2000) , we have little understanding of how adolescents' perceptions of discrimination change over time as a function of age and development. In addition, although research with adolescents has suggested that the correlates of perceived discrimination by adults may be different from those based on discrimination by peers (Fisher et al., 2000; Phelan, Yu, & Davidson, 1994) , this type of distinction has rarely been explored empirically. Finally, the research on the links between perceptions of discrimination and psychological adjustment typically treats one if not both of these factors as static rather than as dynamic processes that change over time.",

Responding to this omission, Garcia Coll and colleagues (1996) proposed an integrative model of the development of ethnic minority children that emphasizes the necessity of studying the \"unique ecological circumstances\" (p. 1893) of children and adolescents of color. These unique circumstances include experiences of discrimination, racism, and prejudice, which, along with the phenomena of multiple forms of segregation (e.g., residential, psychological), impact on traditional contexts of development, including schools and neighborhoods. According to Garcia Coll and colleagues, it is this process that differentiates the development of children and adolescents of color from their White peers. This model of development also maintains that individuallevel characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, and social class, known as social position variables, are important determinants of development and well-being via their contribution to experiences of racism, prejudice, and discrimination. The current research draws from this model of development to empirically examine the associations between gender and ethnicity and perceived discrimination and the link between perceived racial and ethnic discrimination and psychological well-being for Black, Latino, and Asian American adolescents.",

With the development of formal operational thought (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958) , adolescents are increasingly able to discern and reflect upon how their ethnic and/or racial group is evaluated by the larger society and to anticipate future discrimination. In addition, as adolescents begin to explore their own identities, particularly their ethnic identities, they may become increasingly sensitive and attuned to how others treat them, particularly those who are not part of their social groups. Furthermore, as an adolescent's social world expands, and he or she has more contact with mainstream culture, his or her experiences with discrimination may increase as well (Phinney & Chavira, 1995) . Finally, as ethnic minority adolescents move closer to adulthood, they are often perceived as increasingly threatening by adults from the majority culture (Tatum, 1997) and thus may experience more discrimination by adults. This latter experience may be particularly true for Black boys because of the pervasiveness of negative stereotypes regarding this group (Gibbs, 1998) .",

However, the absence of longitudinal research limits our understanding of how individual perceptions of discrimination change over time. We also do not understand how change over time may differ by the source of discrimination. For example, increased social experiences with a broader group of adults (e.g., potential employers, landlords) may lead to a greater increase over time in perceptions of discrimination by adults, whereas perceptions of discrimination by peers may remain more stable over time. Thus, the first goal of the current study is to examine longitudinal changes in perceived discrimination by adults and peers over a 3-year period from middle to late adolescence.",

Such gender differences are supported by qualitative research indicating that ethnic minority boys report more discrimination from various sources (e.g., Whites, police officers, peers) than do their female peers (Waters, 1996; Way, 1998) . Furthermore, ethnic minority boys, especially as they mature, are more likely than are their female peers to be perceived as threatening by adults in the majority culture, which may lead to a steeper increase with age in perceived discrimination for ethnic minority boys than for girls. Thus, although qualitative research suggests that boys and girls experience different levels of overt discrimination, longitudinal research is needed to explore whether gender differentiates changes in perceptions of discrimination over time.",

For example, Black adolescents report more discrimination in general compared with their Latino and Asian American peers (Phinney & Chavira, 1995; Romero & Roberts, 1998) .

Qualitative research finds that these stereotypes, which are themselves forms of institutional discrimination, lead to particular patterns of peer discrimination. In their work with urban high school students, Rosenbloom and Way (2004) found that the preferential treatment of Asian American students by teachers and subsequent feelings of frustration by Latino and Black students toward Asian American students contributed to high levels of discrimination/harassment by Latino and Black students toward their Asian American peers. Similarly, harassment by the police, teachers, and storeowners frequently reported by Black and Latino adolescents (Rosenbloom & Way, 2004; Sellers & Shelton, 2003; Way, 1998 ) may be the result of stereotypes about violence and delinquency faced by these adolescents, particularly the boys (Tatum, 1997) .

The impact of racism and discrimination, however, may be particularly significant during adolescence, as this is a critical period for the development of identity and self-concept (Erikson, 1968; Harter, 1999; Rosenberg, 1965) . Symbolic interactionist theory (e.g., Cooley, 1902) suggests that experiences of discrimination may negatively impact an adolescent's self-esteem, as stereotypes and negative appraisals about one's ethnic group are often internalized in the self-concept. Similarly, social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986) predicts that evaluations and appraisals of the social group to which an individual belongs is an important contributor to self-esteem. In addition, perceptions of racial and ethnic discrimination may reduce adolescents' feelings of selfefficacy and control, fostering instead feelings of helplessness, discouragement, and frustration. These feelings may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms over time (Simons et al., 2002) .",

In addition, recent short-term longitudinal research with middle school students indicated that experiences of discrimination were predictive of declines in psycholog-ical and academic functioning over an 18-month period (Wong et al., 2003 ). Yet, we do not know how discrimination affects psychological adjustment over longer periods of time among high school students. Furthermore, despite the fact that perceptions of discrimination and psychological adjustment change over time, few research projects have examined these constructs dynamically. It remains unclear, consequently, how changes in perceptions of discrimination are related to changes in psychological adjustment over time.",

Phinney (1992) , in particular, has identified two dimensions of ethnic identity that are salient for understanding the well-being of adolescents: ethnic identity achievement, which is the developmental process of exploring and committing to one's ethnic identity, and ethnic affirmation and belonging, which is the sense of pride in and emotional attachment an adolescent has for his or her ethnic group. Together, these two dimensions describe the cognitive (i.e., achievement) and affective (i.e., affirmation and belonging) aspects of ethnic identity. These dimensions, furthermore, appear to be differentially related to experiences of discrimination. For example, in a sample of ethnically diverse middle school students, ethnic identity achievement, but not affirmation and belonging, was positively correlated with perceptions of discrimination (Romero & Roberts, 1998) . Although this finding provides some insight into the role of different dimensions of ethnic identity in predicting levels of perceived discrimination, it remains unclear whether the moderating (or buffering) effects of ethnic identity differ by dimension of ethnic identity. Ethnic affirmation may be more likely than ethnic achievement to buffer against the negative impact of experiences of discrimination because it is more directly associated with feeling good about oneself (i.e., having pride in one's ethnic group) than the latter (Pahl, 2005) . The current study explores the moderating roles of ethnic identity achievement and ethnic affirmation in the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological adjustment.",

Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; Bryk & Raudenbush, 1987 , 1992 ) is used to examine changes in perceived discrimination over time and predictors of change at the intraindividual and interindividual level.",

The MEIM consists of 14 items that assess ethnic identity on two subscales: Ethnic Identity Achievement and Ethnic Affirmation. 5 The Ethnic Identity Achievement subscale contains seven items tapping adolescents' exploration and commitment to their ethnic identity (e.g., I have a clear sense of my ethnic background and what it means to me.). The Ethnic Affirmation subscale contains five items tapping adolescents' feelings of pride, belonging, and attachment to their ethnic group (e.g., I have a strong sense of belonging to my own ethnic group). Participants are asked to respond on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). For the purpose of the present analysis, two mean scores were calculated as measures of ethnic identity achievement and ethnic affirmation. The MEIM has demonstrated good reliability and validity with ethnically diverse high school and college students (Phinney, 1992 ). In the current sample, both subscales yielded adequate to good internal consistency for the total sample at each of the five time points (\u2423 \u03ed .67, .68, .76, .71, .70 at Times 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively for Ethnic Identity Achievement and \u2423 \u03ed .82, .79, .83, .88, .84 at Times 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively for Ethnic Affirmation). In addition, we examined internal consistency for both dimensions for each of the ethnic groups represented in the sample and found it to be adequate or better for each group at each time point for Ethnic Identity Achievement (\u2423 \u03fe .65) and Ethnic Affirmation (\u2423 \u03fe .70). Self-esteem. Self-esteem was assessed at each time point with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE; Rosenberg, 1965) . This measure contains 10 items tapping global self-esteem (e.g., On the whole, I am satisfied or happy with myself). Participants are asked to respond on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). For the purpose of the present analysis, a mean score was calculated as a measure of global self-esteem for each participant at each time point. The RSE was developed for use with high school students, and its validity and reliability have been demonstrated repeatedly (e.g., Hagborg, 1993; Wheelock & Erikson, 1996) . Furthermore, it has been used in previous research with ethnically diverse adolescent samples (e.g., Buhrmester, 1990; ). In the current sample, this measure yielded good internal consistency at each of the five time points (\u2423 \u03ed .86, .90, .89, .89, and .91 at Times 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively). In addition, we examined internal consistency of this measure for each of the ethnic groups represented in the sample and found it to be good to excellent (\u2423 \u03fe .80) for each group at each time point.",

An HLM analysis consists of the simultaneous modeling of within-person (i.e., individual) growth and between-person (i.e., population) growth. At Level 1, within-person or intraindividual growth in perceived discrimination was modeled by regressing repeated measures of perceived discrimination on time, producing a growth trajectory characterized by unique parameters (e.g., intercept, slope) for each participant. At Level 2, the between-person level, the growth parameters estimated at Level 1 became the outcome variables and were used to estimate average (i.e., fixed) effects in the population. In addition, the Level 2 analysis produced estimates of the variability in the population (i.e., random effects) for each of the parameters estimated at Level 1. In each of the models, the time metric was \"centered\" by subtracting two from each time point. As a result of this centering, the intercept is interpreted as each student's reported level of perceived racial and ethnic discrimination at Time 0, or initial status.",

HLM uses empirical Bayesian estimation (Strenio, Weisburg, & Bryk, 1983) to derive the final estimates for each participant, drawing on information at both levels of the analysis. This procedure allows HLM to estimate more precisely parameters of individual growth over time and affords greater power to detect predictors of individual differences in change even with relatively small samples (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1987) . This process also allows HLM to handle missing data at Level 1 of the analysis. Thus, unlike alternative strategies for examining repeated measures data, HLM allows the number and spacing of observations to vary between participants (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992) . As a result, an HLM analysis can include participants who do not have data for all time points. Finally, HLM can include covariates that change over time. This is crucial to the current study, as we are interested in the dynamic relationship between changes in perceptions of discrimination and psychological adjustment over time.",

There were no significant differences between Black and West Indian adolescents or between Chinese American and non-Chinese Asian American adolescents on any variables. Thus, for all remaining analyses, Black and West Indian participants were grouped into a category labeled Black and the Chinese American and the non-Chinese Asian American participants were grouped into a category labeled Asian American. Among Latino participants, we found significant differences in perceived discrimination by peers between Puerto Rican and Dominican adolescents, with Dominican adolescents reporting significantly higher levels of discrimination than their Puerto Rican peers at Times 2, 4, and 5. We also compared Dominican participants with other Latino adolescents (i.e., Cuban, Venezuelan) but found no significant differences between these much smaller groups of participants. Thus, we divided our Latino sample into Puerto Rican, which was the largest subgroup, and non-Puerto Rican Latino, which consisted primarily of Dominican adolescents. Thus, for all growth models, Black, Puerto Rican, non-Puerto Rican Latino, and Asian American represented the four groups in the study that were contrasted with each other. In the assessment of ethnic differences, the Puerto Rican students were used as a reference group based on the size of this group relative to the other ethnic groups in the study and in the school. Similarly, in order to examine gender differences in trajectories of perceived discrimination, a dummy variable representing gender was constructed (1 \u03ed female, 0 \u03ed male).",

Preliminary analyses were conducted to determine the form of growth in self-esteem and depressive symptoms over time. For both outcome measures, models including linear and quadratic effects of time were found to best fit the data. 8 Results of these models can be seen in Table 5 . Next, in separate models, the time-varying levels of self-esteem and depressive symptoms were predicted from the time-varying levels of perceived discrimination by adults and peers. This method assesses whether within-person changes in self-esteem and depressive symptoms across time were predicted by within-person changes in perceived discrimination across time, above and beyond the effects of age. Perceived discrimination was centered around each participant's unique mean averaged over time (i.e., group mean centering) when entered into the Level 1 equations. This centering removes invariant effects of the participant, leaving only deviations from the participant's unique mean. In addition, a variable representing perceived discrimination averaged over time was entered into the Level 2 equations predicting the intercept and 8 For example, the unconditional model for self-esteem was as follows: Level 1: SE ij \u03ed 0j \u03e9 1j (Time) \u03e9 2j (Time) 2 \u03e9 r ij ; (3a) Level 2: 0j \u03ed \u2425 00 \u03e9 u 0j ; (3b) 1j \u03ed \u2425 10 \u03e9 u 1j ; (3c) 2j \u03ed \u2425 20 \u03e9 u 2j ; (3d) where SE ij represents self-esteem for the jth participant at the ith time; 0j represents the intercept of the growth curve for participant j, which represents the value of self-esteem at initial status; 1j represents the linear growth rate for participant j; 2j represents the quadratic growth rate for participant j; and r ij represents the residual for person j at Time i. In the Level 2 equations, \u2425 00 , \u2425 10 , and \u2425 20 represent the population average intercept, linear growth rate, and quadratic growth rate, respectively (i.e., the fixed effects); and u 0j , u 1j , and u 2j represent the variance or random effects associated with these estimates. growth rates in order to explore whether between-person differences in perceived discrimination are predictive of between-person differences in trajectories of self-esteem and depressive symptoms. 9 Four separate models were examined for the four combinations of variables (i.e., perceived discrimination by adults predicting self-esteem, perceived discrimination by adults predicting depressive symptoms, perceived discrimination by peers predicting self-esteem, and perceived discrimination by peers predicting depressive symptoms). In addition, the possible moderating effects of ethnic identity achievement and ethnic affirmation on the association between perceived discrimination and self-esteem or depressive symptoms were explored. In order to facilitate interpretation of these results, median splits were performed for ethnic identity achievement and ethnic affirmation, and dummy variables were created representing participants who were high (above the median \u03ed 1) and low (below the median \u03ed 0) for ethnic identity achievement or ethnic affirmation. These dummy variables were entered into the Level 2 equation predicting the time-varying association between perceived discrimination and self-esteem or depressive symptoms. Finally, in order to assess ethnicity as a moderator of the association between perceived discrimination and self-esteem or depressive symptoms, we examined four separate models for the four combinations of perceived discrimination by adults and peers and self-esteem and depressive symptoms, including dummy variables for ethnicity as Level 2 predictors of the associations between perceived discrimination and self-esteem or depressive symptoms. Perceived discrimination by adults. For self-esteem, as predicted, results from the Level 1 analysis (i.e., within person) indicated that increases over time in perceptions of discrimination by adults were significantly associated with decreases over time in self-esteem. At Level 2, discrimination by adults was negatively associated with self-esteem at initial status, indicating that adolescents who reported more discrimination by adults also reported lower self-esteem. In a second set of models assessing the moderating effects of ethnic identity achievement and ethnic affirmation, neither ethnic identity achievement nor ethnic affirmation was a significant moderator of the relationship between changes in perceived discrimination by adults and changes in self-esteem over time. These results can be seen in Table 5 . Finally, we examined the moderating effects of ethnicity on the relationship between perceived discrimination by adults and changes in self-esteem over time and found that ethnicity was not a significant moderator of this association.",

In the Level 2 equations, \u2425 00 , \u2425 10, and \u2425 20 represent the average intercept, linear growth rate, and quadratic growth rate, respectively (i.e., the fixed effects) for individuals with average (value of zero) Mean Discrimination; \u2425 01 , \u2425 11, and \u2425 21 represent the average difference in the intercept, liner and quadratic slopes for a 1-unit difference in Mean Discrimination; and u 0j , u 1j , and u 3j represent the variance or random effects associated with these estimates.",

Discrimination by peers was also significantly associated with the quadratic growth rate, indicating that adolescents who reported more discrimination by peers experienced a greater acceleration in depressive symptoms over time.

In addition, the results indicate strong associations between changes over time in perceptions of racial and ethnic discrimination and changes over time in psychological well-being; when adolescents reported increases over time in discrimination by adults and peers, they also reported increases over time in depressive symptoms and/or decreases over time in self-esteem. These relationships were generally robust across ethnic groups, although the self-esteem of Puerto Rican adolescents was less affected by perceived peer discrimination than was the self-esteem of other participants. Finally, as predicted, we found that ethnic identity affirmation serves as a buffer for the negative effects of discrimination by peers on self-esteem.

Our first hypothesis, that perceptions of discrimination would be a significant factor in the lives of urban, ethnic minority adolescents was confirmed. We found that adolescents in the current study reported significant levels of perceived discrimination by both adults and peers. This result is consistent with earlier concurrent quantitative and qualitative research indicating the pervasive nature of ethnic and racial discrimination (Kessler et al., 1999; Szalacha et al., 2003b; Way, 1998) . Our study suggests that ethnic minority adolescents experience significant levels of peer discrimination even in the absence of White peers. Qualitative research with the adolescents from this study indicated that peer-level discrimination occurs within and across ethnic minority groups (see Way et al., 2005) . For example, the Asian American adolescents report being discriminated against by other Asian American students and by Black and Latino students, whereas the Dominican students reported being discriminated against by their Puerto Rican peers (Way et al., 2005) . Further understanding of the root of these discrimination patterns within and across ethnic minority groups is an important direction for future research. On the basis of changes in cognitive and social development, we hypothesized that adolescents would report more discrimination over time, particularly by adults. This hypothesis was partially supported. Consistent with earlier cross-sectional research that has found older adolescents to report more discrimination than younger adolescents (e.g., Fisher et al., 2000; Romero & Roberts, 1998) , our results suggest that adolescents experienced an increase, on average, in perceptions of discrimination by adults over the course of the study. As predicted, however, there were no age-related changes in perceptions of discrimination by peers. The difference in growth patterns between these two sources of discrimination underscores the importance of examining the source of perceived ethnic and racial discrimination. Although ethnic minority adolescents may experience more discrimination by adults as they grow older as a result of increased contact with adults from the majority culture (e.g., when applying for a job or internship), discrimination by peers may be less influenced by age during high school because there is no change typically in the type of peers to which the adolescents are exposed during these years (especially among those adolescents who remain in the same high school). Thus, although changes may occur in levels of peer discrimination in the transition from high school to college (when one is typically exposed to a new set of peers), for example, changes may not occur in perceptions of peer discrimination during the high school years. Research should continue to examine the trajectories of discrimination by source in order to shed additional light on the underlying mechanisms of stability and change.",

Although boys and girls reported similar trajectories of discrimination in the current sample, ethnicity was a significant moderator of perceptions of discrimination. Asian American adolescents reported more peer discrimination than did Puerto Rican adolescents, a finding that is consistent with previous qualitative and quantitative investigations (e.g., Fisher, et al., 2000; Rosenbloom & Way, 2004; Way et al., 2005) . This finding is likely influenced by a confluence of factors, including the pattern of differential treatment of the Asian American students by the teachers and the poor treatment of Black and Latino students by these same teachers (see Rosenbloom & Way, 2004) . Such differential treatment is a source of great frustration for many Black and Latino students who attend school with Asian American students (Conchas & Noguera, 2004; Rosenbloom & Way, 2004) . However, the non-Puerto Rican Latino (primarily Dominican) adolescents in the current sample also reported higher levels of discrimination by their peers. Both the Asian American students and the non-Puerto Rican Latino students in the sample were more likely to be first or second generation immigrants than were their Puerto Rican and Black peers, suggesting that immigrant status or levels of acculturation may be related to experiences of racial and ethnic discrimination (Lee, 2004) . In addition to reporting higher levels of peer discrimination, Asian American students also reported more discrimination by adults at the start of the study compared with their Puerto Rican peers. Differential treatment by teachers may not necessarily be experienced positively by Asian American students and may instead be experienced as discriminatory if these students feel pressured to live up to the expectations of the \"model minority myth.\" Furthermore, our qualitative data suggest that Asian American students believe that \"Americans,\" which includes adults as well as peers, look down on them and do not respect their Asian culture (Way, Greene, & Pahl, 2004) . Research needs to further explore how the model minority myth and immigrant status are associated with experiences of discrimination for Asian American students.",

Consistent with previous research that has supported concurrent and short-term links between perceived discrimination and self-esteem and/or depressive symptoms (e.g., Rumbaut, 1994; Wong et al., 2003) , adolescents in the current sample who experienced higher levels of peer and adult discrimination also experienced lower self-esteem and more depressive symptoms compared with adolescents who reported less perceived discrimination. Furthermore, adolescents who reported more perceived discrimination by adults and by peers experienced a greater acceleration in the growth of depressive symptoms over the course of the study compared with adolescents who reported relatively low levels of perceived discrimination. In addition, on an individual level, increases in perceived discrimination were associated with decreases in self-esteem and increases in depressive symptoms. When ethnicity was examined as a moderator, however, the self-esteem of Puerto Rican adolescents was less affected by changes in perceived discrimination by peers over time compared with that of Black, Asian American, and other Latino participants. This finding is consistent with our qualitative research that suggests the high social status of the Puerto Ricans in the school and their numeric majority within the school (see Way et al., 2005) protected them from the negative effects of peer discrimination. Peer discrimination may have less of a negative impact for those adolescents who enjoy high social status and/or are in the majority within a school than for those who are in the minority and/or are lower on the social hierarchy.",

In many respects, this finding is not surprising given the emphasis on peer relationships during adolescence (Savin-Williams & Berndt, 1990) . Experiences of discrimination by peers are similar to peer rejection, which has been repeatedly shown to have a negative impact on psychological adjustment (Asher, Hymel, & Renshaw, 1984; Vernberg, 1990) . Experiences of discrimination by adults may be more strongly linked to other outcomes such as academic and/or vocational achievement than is peer discrimination. If teachers and other adults are more encouraging of and have higher expectations for Asian American students, the academic achievement of Latino and Black students may suffer at the hands of this discriminatory treatment from adults (Farkas, Grobe, Sheehand, & Shaun, 1990) . Thus, future research needs to explore the impact of discrimination by adults and by peers on multiple types of outcomes rather than simply on psychological adjustment alone. Multiple outcomes, coupled with multiple sources of discrimination, will enhance our understanding of the detrimental effects of discrimination on youth.",

On the basis of recent theoretical and empirical literature stressing the multidimensionality of ethnic identity (Ashmore et al., 2004; Caldwell, Zimmerman, Bernat, Sellers, & Notaro, 2002) , we examined two aspects of ethnic identity, ethnic affirmation and ethnic identity achievement, in order to better understand its possible moderating role. Surprisingly, neither ethnic identity achievement nor affirmation and belonging moderated the association between discrimination by adults and psychological adjustment. This finding may be due to the relatively weaker association found in the current study between discrimination by adults and psychological functioning. However, when peer discrimination was examined, ethnic identity achievement and affirmation were both significant moderators of the effects of peer discrimination on changes in self-esteem over time. Adolescents who reported little exploration and commitment to their ethnic iden-tity experienced a weaker association between perceptions of discrimination by peers and self-esteem compared with their peers who were more involved in the process of developing their ethnic identity. This result suggests that the process of exploring one's ethnic identity may place one at risk of greater psychological vulnerability to discrimination. According to social identity theory and models of ethnic identity development, the process of ethnic identity exploration may enhance the in-group versus out-group distinction, which in turn may intensify the salience and importance of ethnicity for the selfconcept (Cross, 1991; Phinney, 1989 Phinney, , 1990 Phinney, , 1991 Tajfel & Turner, 1986) . Consequently, perceived racial and ethnic discrimination may be more detrimental to one's self-esteem during this active process. However, once an individual has achieved a committed sense of his or her ethnicity and ethnic identity, this vulnerability may no longer be present.",

Self-esteem was less affected by perceptions of discrimination by peers when adolescents felt a strong sense of affirmation and belonging to his or her ethnic group. An adolescent who feels good about being a member of his or her ethnic group may be more likely to dismiss an experience of racial and ethnic discrimination rather than to internalize this experience (Cross et al., 1998) . This sense of attachment and belonging to one's ethnic group is often found during the later stages of ethnic identity development (e.g., Cross, 1991) . Thus, the current results provide strong support for our existing models of ethnic identity development (Cross, 1991; Phinney, 1989 ), suggesting that vulnerability may be enhanced during the process of exploration but is reduced when an adolescent feels affective attachment and affirmation to his or her ethnic group.",

In addition, although theory and research have emphasized the effects of discrimination on psychological adjustment, we must also consider the possibility that the variables examined in the present study exert bidirectional influences on each other. For example, perceptions of discrimination by peers may be a function of an adolescent's self-esteem or psychological well-being in general.

In addition, the students in the current study attended a school that was composed predominantly of ethnic minority students. As discussed earlier, this latter fact suggests, and our qualitative data indicate (see Way et al., 2005) , that the adolescents' reports of discrimination from peers were not received from White students, as may be the case in other studies of perceived discrimination, but rather from other ethnic minority adolescents.

Future research should continue to explore the experiences of ethnically diverse youth in a variety of settings by using research methods that are sensitive to both group and individual-level variation. It is only with these efforts that we can begin to fully understand the diversity of adolescent experience. Our findings also underscore the importance of examining ethnic and racial discrimination, in particular, in studies of social and emotional development. A thorough examination of the impact of experiences of discrimination on well-being and development and the moderators of such experiences will allow psychologists and educators to understand the challenges faced by ethnic minority adolescents as well as their strengths and resiliencies.
