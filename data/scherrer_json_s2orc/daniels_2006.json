Peer acceptance was considered as a possible mediator of the relationship between sport participation and global self-esteem. The sample included girls (N=4,689) and boys (N=5,811) between the ages of 12 and 21 (M=15 years) who were part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Analyses revealed that peer acceptance partially mediated the relation between sport participation and global self-esteem for girls as well as boys. Findings suggest the importance of considering how sport participation and self-evaluations in particular domains may contribute to global feelings of self-worth. The role of peers in this relationship is discussed in relation to changing social attitudes about girls' sport participation.",

Given the increased need for belongingness during adolescence, we proposed that peer acceptance would mediate the association between sport participation and self-esteem. It is important to understand factors related to sport participation because of the potentially positive effects of physical activity on school involvement, body image, feelings of physical competence, and a range of other psychosocial outcomes in girls as well as boys (Eccles & Barber, 1999; Marsh & Kleitman, 2003; President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 1997; Richman & Shaffer, 2000) . We were particularly interested in exploring similarities and differences in these factors for adolescent girls as well as boys because sport is a highly gendered context (Messner, 2002) , and boys participate in sport in greater numbers than girls (4.0 million and 2.9 million, respectively) (National Federation of State High School Associations, 2004) .",

Some studies have shown that sport participation is associated with positive self-evaluations in global and domain-specific aspects of people's self-concepts. For example, Marsh and Jackson (1986) found that female athletes had more positive self-evaluations of their physical competence than did female non-athletes. Athletes also had a significantly higher level of global self-worth (i.e., self-esteem) than did non-athletes, but the average difference was small in magnitude. Other research suggests that the impact of sport participation on self-esteem may depend on domain-specific aspects of individuals' selfconcepts. In a retrospective study, Richman and Shaffer (2000) found that girls' high school sport participation predicted global self-worth in college but that self-perceived physical competence, positive body image, and gender-role flexibility were mediators of this relationship. The authors argued that it is important to consider mediators that might link sport participation and selfesteem. Accordingly, we considered adolescents' perceived peer acceptance as a potentially influential factor. In particular, we hypothesized that peer acceptance would mediate the association between adolescents' sport participation and their self-esteem.",

In contrast, when individuals view themselves as negatively regarded by important others, they internalize the perception and experience low self-esteem.

Systematic sampling methods and implicit stratification were employed to ensure that the schools selected were representative of US schools with respect to region of country, urbanicity, size, type, and ethnicity. In total, 119,233 adolescents in grades 7 through 9 were eligible to participate in the Add Health study. There were 90,118 students who completed the in-school survey.

As predicted, peer acceptance did indeed mediate the relationship between sport participation and global self-esteem. Our results build on the work of Richman and Shaffer (2000) who also found domainspecific aspects of self-concept mediated the association between sport participation and self-esteem. Together, both investigations suggest the importance of exploring perceived competence in different domains when examining the impact of sport participation on girls' and boys' self- concepts. Moreover, in highlighting the potential role of peer acceptance, our study underscores the importance of viewing sport participation in a larger social context. As our results indicated, peer acceptance mediated the association between sport participation and later self-esteem for boys and girls. The result for boys is consistent with the strong connection between sport and masculinity in US society. As Messner (1989) has noted, US society typically judges boys by their athletic ability and interest in sports. This notion is captured in remark attributed to Zane Grey, the writer of Old West adventure novels: \"All boys love baseball. If they don't they're not real boys\" (as cited in Messner, 1989, p. 103) . Our results suggest that boys' participation in sports remains an important avenue to peer acceptance and later positive feelings of self-worth.",

We believe that peer acceptance may be especially important for girls given the continuing resistance that some athletic girls may experience (Guillet, Sarrazin, & Fontayne, 2000; Smith & Leaper, 2006) . As noted earlier, sport has not historically been a socially acceptable activity for girls and women in the US. Since the passage of Title IX legislation, however, youth may be more accepting of girls' sport participation than in the past (e.g., Jaffee & Ricker, 1993) . Thus, physically active girls accepted by their peers are likely to experience increased feelings of global self-esteem. We anticipate that increased societal acceptance of girls' and women's athleticism will make it easier for girls to obtain positive socioemotional benefits from their sport participation. This expectation is consistent with recent research that shows that sport involvement predicts increased school attachment and lower levels of social isolation (Eccles & Barber, 1999; Stone, Barber, & Eccles, unpublished manuscript, retrieved February 15, 2006 from http://rcgd.isr.umich.edu/garp/articles.htm).",

The large sample size and longitudinal design are notable strengths of the design. At the same time, we also want to acknowledge some limitations. First, the magnitude of the correlations between sport participation, peer acceptance, and selfesteem were small (rs<0.10). We readily acknowledge that many factors, besides athletic participation, contribute to adolescents' global self-esteem over time. However, the fact that these correlations existed across time lends some additional confidence to the validity of the observed model. Also, the small effect sizes may have been due partly to limitations with the measures available in the Add Health data set. The relevant measure of sport participation was based on adolescents' reported sport participation in the past week. Therefore, this measure did not distinguish between regular versus sporadic play. Nor did it distinguish between sport activities that were and those that were not school-affiliated. Further, the peer acceptance measure was not ideal because it was self-report, although this is a common practice in many studies. Thus, as with any study based on a data archive, we were limited to the measures that had been chosen by others. We believe that the large sample size helped to mitigate these sources of error, but it did incur the cost of reduced effect sizes.",
