                "text": "A number of theories suggest that positive parentchild relationships foster children's healthy feelings of overall self-worth (i.e., global self-esteem). For example, Susan Harter, an expert on the development of self-esteem, posited, \"For securely attached infants, a working model of self as valued, loved, and competent will emerge in the context of a working model of parents as emotionally available, loving, sensitive, and supportive of mastery attempts\" (2006a, p. 519), and Alan Sroufe, an expert on parent-child relationships, stated, \"Nothing is more important for the child's development than the quality of care received\" (2002, p. 187) . Cross-sectional, correlational studies provide ample support for a consistent relation between parentchild closeness and self-esteem (e.g., Barber, Chadwick, & Oerter, 1992; Rice, 1990; Verschueren, Marcoen, & Schoefs, 1996; Whitbeck et al., 1991) . However, longitudinal research does not provide clear support that positive parent-child relation-ships predict the development (i.e., change) of selfesteem over time (Allen, Hauser, Bell, & O'Connor, 1994; Boudreault-Bouchard et al., 2013; Greene & Way, 2005; Roberts & Bengtson, 1996; Yang & Schaninger, 2010) . This pattern of conflicting findings (i.e., robust concurrent correlation but no consistent longitudinal correlation) could mean that (a) the relation between parent-child relationships and self-esteem reflects a reverse effect (i.e., self-esteem predicts the development of positive parent-child relationships over time), (b) the relation is complex and requires appropriate complex statistical modeling to capture the process by which parent-child relationships impact the development of selfesteem, (c) the inconsistency in longitudinal studies reflects critical methodological differences between studies (i.e., the existence of moderators), (d) the true effect is small and therefore difficult to detect without adequate sample sizes, and/or (e) the relation between self-esteem and parent-child relationships is attributable to a third variable. The current study evaluates evidence for these possibilities during adolescence, a critical time to study self-esteem change.",

For example, self-esteem is related to positive affectivity (Brown & Marshall, 2001) , subjective wellbeing (DeNeve & Cooper, 1998) , task persistence (Di Paula & Campbell, 2002) , economic wealth (Kuster, Orth, & Meier, 2013; Trzesniewski et al., 2006) , lower rates of depressive symptoms (Orth, Robins, Trzesniewski, Maes, & Schmitt, 2009; Sowislo & Orth, 2013; Steiger, Allemand, Robins, & Fend, 2014) , loneliness (Jones, Freemon, & Goswick, 1981) , and anxiety (Sedikides, Rudich, Gregg, Kumashiro, & Rusbult, 2004; Sowislo & Orth, 2013) . In addition, self-esteem has been shown to have a long-term impact. For example, adolescents with lower selfesteem, compared to those with higher self-esteem, are more likely as adults to have mental and physical health problems, antisocial behavior, and educational, occupational, and monetary trouble (Steiger, Allemand, Robins, & Fend, 2014; Trzesniewski et al., 2006) . These findings underscore the idea that selfesteem is associated with consequential life outcomes.",

A longstanding belief is that self-esteem stems from relationships with others. For example, Cooley (1902) and Mead (1934) suggested that a person comes to view himsellf or herself through the lens of others' opinions (i.e., reflected appraisals). This concept is illustrated in research showing that having a warm and supportive relationship partner leads to increases in selfesteem over time (Murray, Holmes, & Griffin, 2000) . Others have taken this theory further by suggesting that dispositional self-esteem is an adaptive trait that evolved to serve as an indicator of how accepted one is by a social group. That is, given that humans need to belong to a social group to survive, it is necessary to know when one is being rejected. According to this sociometer theory, selfesteem therefore serves as a social indicator of acceptance or rejection (Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Leary, Cottrell, & Phillips, 2001) .",

For example, attachment theory suggests that a secure attachment with a primary caregiver will facilitate feelings of self-worth and importance (Sroufe, 2002; Thompson, 2006) . Through consistent, warm, and supportive interactions with a caregiver, a child is thought to develop an internal working model that consists of positive views of the self; that is, the child will develop a view of self as important and worthy of love (Thompson, 2006) . This perspective emphasizing parents fits well with the broader theories about larger social groups given that parents are likely to be major factors in the social worlds of developing individuals. In short, a number of perspectives converge on the idea that close and supportive relationships (particularly with parents) are an important influence on the development of selfesteem.",

One reason for this ambiguity is that the internal working model is thought to develop during the 1st year of life (Thompson, 2006) , whereas a rudimentary sense of self does not develop until the 2nd year of life (Harter, 2006a) , and a global evaluation of the self is thought to not develop until early or even middle childhood (Harter, 2006a) . Due to these considerations, self-esteem development has scarcely been investigated before middle childhood. In addition, despite the development of some methodologies for assessing young children's global self-esteem (see Verschueren et al., 1996) , there continues to be debate as to whether childhood self-evaluations are valid. That is, self-esteem during middle childhood tends to be unrealistically positive and may not be comparable to global self-esteem in adolescence and adulthood (e.g., Harter, 2006a; Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 1991; Trzesniewski, Kinal, & Donnellan, 2010) . Thus, adolescence rather than childhood is a less controversial time to study the antecedents of global self-esteem.",

An alternative is to study the relation at a time of transition when either the parent-child relationship, the child's self-esteem, or both are changing. Adolescence is such a period given that an adolescent's self-view is changing and their relationships with their parents are also going through a period of reorganization (e.g., changing expectations, independence). Although the classic idea of adolescence being a time of intense and unqualified \"storm and stress\" (Hall, 1904) is usually dismissed by developmentalists (e.g., Eccles et al., 1993; Petersen, 1988; Steinberg & Morris, 2001) , adolescence is still considered a time of relatively large amounts of change and asynchrony in the maturation of different developmental systems (Arnett, 1999; Casey et al., 2010) . For example, Eccles (1999) stated, \"Few developmental periods are characterized by so many changes at so many different levels as early adolescence\" (p. 36; see also Blakemore & Mills, 2014; Steinberg, 2005) . These changes are likely to impact the family system and lead to changes in parent-child relationships, thereby providing an important opportunity to evaluate the dynamic connections between selfesteem and parent-child relationships.",

Namely, there are indications that parent influences might weaken as children progress through the adolescent period. For example, social relationships become less hierarchical throughout adolescence, with a greater focus on peers (Bornstein, Jager, & Steinberg, 2012) . This suggests that parents might have a declining impact on the development of self-esteem during the adolescent years. On the other hand, there is no reason to believe that parental support is unimportant for self-esteem during adolescence (Harter, 2006a) , and attachment research suggests that relationships with parents exert a continuing influence on the development of the self. Thus, although there are potential caveats regarding the development of self-esteem during adolescence and parentchild relationships, parents are still viewed as important figures in the lives of adolescents.",

This relation has been found across countries (e.g., Norway, Australia, United States, China, Japan) and ages (e.g., Barber et al., 1992; Verschueren et al., 1996; Whitbeck et al., 1991) . In addition, a meta-analysis of this literature found a significant aggregated correlation between parent-child relationships and self-esteem when pooling across adolescence and young adulthood (r = .35); however, the strength of this effect declined with age as individuals presumably transitioned away from the family of origin (r = .40 in high school and r = .24 in young adulthood; Rice, 1990) .",

Table 1 summarizes the results across studies as well as showing differences in methodology used to test the underlying ideas (i.e., sample sizes, reporters of parent-child relationships, measures used for parent-child relationships, ages of participants, time lags, statistical models used to test change, and controls included in the analyses). These differences in methodology might be contributing to the inconsistencies in findings, leading to uncertainty about the dynamic relations between parent-child relationships and selfesteem. For example, Roberts and Bengtson (1996) used a path model to estimate the association between parental affection and later self-esteem and found no effect independent from that of selfesteem stability, whereas Boudreault-Bouchard et al. (2013) used growth curve modeling and found an effect of parental emotional support on later self-esteem. These two statistical methods test different types of change. Path models test whether parent-child relationships predict the over-or underestimation of the child's later self-esteem, based on what would be expected by a person's baseline self-esteem, whereas the growth curve analysis models linear change in mean scores using information from more than two time points, thus providing an overall trajectory to predict. Theories of parent-child relationships and self-esteem do not provide sufficient information to hypothesize the precise way in which parent-child closeness might impact self-esteem development. Thus, it is not possible to claim that there is a single \"best test\" of the associations between parent-child relationships and self-esteem because different statistical models address different questions. One possible next step toward identifying the true relation could be to conduct a meta-analysis and test for moderators of the resultant effect size. However, the small number of studies and the variability across the studies makes this option difficult. For example, control variables varied across studies, and different authors used different statistical models, both of which make it difficult to gather consistent types of effect sizes for meta-analyzing. Thus, we suggest that a productive next step is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation in which the various statistical models used in previous studies are evaluated within a single data set.",

The present study extends previous research by providing a comprehensive test of this relation through the use of multiple methodologies that have been used in previous studies, all tested within a single study. Combining the different methodologies within a single study can help address questions of inconsistency across studies by holding sample characteristics and measurement constructs constant and varying the statistical analyses and measurement methodology. Specifically, we test the four longitudinal models that have been used by past researchers and add two newer models that may be more effective at capturing the dynamic relations between parent-child relationships and self-esteem (the latent difference score [LDS] and enduring effects models). In addition, we test all of these models in two different samples from two countries to assess the robustness and generalizability of the findings. Finally, we test each of the different ways that the parent-child relationship has been assessed: observational reports of mother-child and father-child interactions (Allen et al., 1994) , parent-reported closeness (Yang & Schaninger, 2010) , and child-reported closeness. In sum, we believe that the current study captures the breadth of methodologies that have been used in previous research, and we believe that testing all of these methodologies within a single study will bring us closer to detecting the true effect between parent-child closeness and child selfesteem. Study 1 is based on a sample of German adolescents followed from ages 12 to 16 and childreported parent-child closeness. Study 2 is based on a sample of American adolescents followed from ages 13 to 16 and child-, parent-, and observer-reported parent-child closeness. Self-reported selfesteem using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE; Rosenberg, 1965) is used in both studies, as this is the most commonly used measure of global selfesteem in the literature and was developed for use with adolescents (see Donnellan, Trzesniewski, & Robins, 2015) . As noted above, parent-child relationships are assessed in different ways across studies, but there is clear theoretical guidance suggesting that warmth and communication between a parent and child helps the child develop a positive view of self (e.g., attachment research; Sroufe, 2002; Thompson, 2006) . We capture those ideas with measures that reflect parent-child relationships that are high in trust, low in avoidance, and include quality time with shared experiences. We refer to these measures as parent-child closeness. In addition, in Study 2, we test whether the relation between parent-child closeness and self-esteem is spurious by introducing a number of controls for conceptually relevant third variables to test whether they reduce the cross-sectional correlation between parent-child closeness and self-esteem.",

We begin with this approach and then use latent variable structural models that conceptualize change in different ways and to address concerns with measurement error. Prior to testing the five latent variable models, we tested for longitudi-nal measurement invariance of the models and found evidence for strong measurement invariance for both self-esteem and parent-child closeness (i.e., equal factor loadings and equal intercepts over time). Across all of the models we used this final invariant model as our base model. We then tested a series of models with increasing constraints. We used a cutoff of > .01 change in confirmatory fit index and/or root mean square error of approximation to determine substantive decrease in model fit (see Cheung & Rensvold, 1999 , 2002 Yap et al., 2014) , with one exception: The parent-child closeness invariance models showed that weak invariance fit better than strong invariance. However, we chose to retain strong invariance in this specification to be consistent across all models. Moreover, some of the weak invariant models (e.g., cross-lag, growth curve with the weak invariance parentchild closeness model) failed to converge. One possibility for this could be the large number of parameters in the weak invariance model. See Results S1, p. 7 for methodology and comparative model fit indices used to establish measurement invariance.",

In particular, we set the initial slope loading to zero and the last slope loading to one. We then allowed the loadings in between those fixed values to be freely estimated. One controversy with this model pertains to the estimation of the cross-paths (see McArdle, 2009, pp. 594-595) . Given that we wanted to test whether parent-child closeness will predict change over time in self-esteem, we were particularly interested in the cross-paths. To test this, we set the intercept to be at age 12 (Study 1) and age 13 (Study 2). These intercepts do not reflect a true zero point. Instead, they represent a transi-tion point in which many changes are occurring and thus a reasonable starting point for studying longitudinal associations between parent-child relationships and adolescent self-esteem. However, we acknowledge that this intercept does not represent the beginning of the relation between parent-child closeness and self-esteem.",

The first is called the enduring effects model, which suggests that a construct at one point in development can have a concurrent relation with another construct that then persists across time. In other words, this enduring effects model would suggest that the initial level of closeness would be correlated with the initial level of adolescent self-esteem, and the initial level of closeness would have a lasting impact on all later assessments of self-esteem. On the other hand, the revisionist model suggests that a construct at one point in development can have a concurrent relation with another construct, but the relation dissipates across development. That is, initial levels of closeness may be correlated with initial levels of self-esteem and may impact later self-esteem indirectly through its stability over time, but there is no direct effect to later self-esteem.",

Thus, we predicted that the latent change model, which taps several different types of change (growth curve, cross-lag), in addition to testing the impact of change in parent-child relationships on change in self-esteem across each time point (something none of the other models can detect), would be the most likely to find evidence for the presumably dynamic relation between parent-child closeness and adolescent self-esteem development. We describe the unique contributions of each of our models below. We also expected results to replicate in both samples, given there are not strong theories predicting differences in this relation across cultures. Finally, we predicted that the largest effects would be found using child-reported parent-child closeness (both because of shared method variance with selfesteem and because the child's perception likely has a larger impact on their beliefs about themselves than others' perceptions), whereas the smallest would be found using observer-rated closeness, and effect sizes for parent-reported closeness would be in between child-and observer-rated effects.",

Participants were part of the Life Study, an ongoing, longitudinal study that currently has seven waves of data on two generations (Fend et al., 2012) . Individuals were originally recruited via study partici-pation of schools from the city of Frankfurt and two rural areas in the region of Hessen (West Germany). Students in Germany are allocated to different schools based on their school performance at the age of 10. In order to gain a representative sample of all students, schools were chosen according to the representative percentage of students within each school level in Germany. The large majority of the participants (76.1%) lived in a household with both parents, whereas 14.3% of all parents were separated or divorced. A small percentage of the participants lived with a single mother (12.1%), or a single father (4.9%). Most mothers (36.2%) were housewives, 22% worked full-time, 28.5% worked part-time, and 12.8% worked from time to time by the hour. The study was conducted within the school setting by trained researchers, and participants completed standardized questionnaires at all five measurement occasions.",

Parent closeness was assessed yearly from ages 12 to 16 years with eight items indicating how a child perceives each of his or her parents with regard to closeness, interest, attention, and rejection. The scale was developed for the German Youth Study Project (see Specht & Fend, 1986 ) based on a theoretical definition of functional parent-adolescent relationships. Items are: \"When I have problems, I'd rather keep them to myself than tell my mom or dad,\" \"I have the feeling I can talk to my mom or dad about everything,\" \"My mom or dad doesn't really care much about me,\" \"My mom or dad often has other things to do when I want to be with them,\" \"Between my mom or dad and me, there are a lot of fights,\" \"My mom or dad always listens attentively when I want to tell him or her something,\" \"My mom or dad is not really interested in what I think and feel,\" and \"My mom or dad shows a lot of understanding for my problems,\" and participants rated each item on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The items were summed to create a total score (potential range = 8-40) and then POMP scored (Cohen et al., 1999) to facilitate comparison across studies. Participants who responded to fewer than four items were excluded from the analyses. Missing items were filled with a mean score of the completed responses for participants who responded to four or more items. Cronbach's alpha reliability was high for all measurement occasions, as = .85-.87. This parent-child closeness scale has been widely used in previous studies (e.g., Fend, 1990a Fend, , 1990b Fend, Berger, & Grob, 2009; Trautwein, 2003) and correlates moderately to highly with other theoretically important measures of parenting such as appreciation and respect, inconsistency and arbitrariness in discipline, and intensity of punishment and neglect. Means and standard deviations ranged from 67.48 (19.68) at age 12 to 64.18 (17.85) at age 16 (see Results S1, p. 3 for descriptive statistics at each year).",

Thus, we conducted one last analysis to further probe the longitudinal relation from parent-child closeness to self-esteem. We expected a revisionist model that would fit the data the best because concurrent correlations are high, but the longitudinal effects show no relation. We tested seven models that had increasing levels of constraints. Across the seven models, there was no reduction in model fit, but not all of the models were nested, so we based our final decision on the AIC, which suggested that Model 7 was the best fitting model (see Results S1, p. 21). Model 7 fit the data well (see Table 2 , row 13) and indicates that after accounting for the relation between initial level of parent closeness and adolescent self-esteem (bs = .46, p = .00), selfesteem first-order stabilities (bs = .37-.64, p = .00), self-esteem second-order stabilities (bs = .20-.35, p = .00), and parent closeness first-order stabilities (bs = .73-.88, p = .00), parent closeness continues to have a small, concurrent effect on self-esteem across adolescence (bs = .13-.15, p = .00), but no prospective effect. This finding is consistent with the robust concurrent correlation between parentchild closeness and self-esteem, but again suggests that this relation does not represent a large prospective effect of parent closeness on change in self-esteem.",

It is possible that the failure to find a relation is due to culture (e.g., factors other than parent-child closeness might have a more prominent impact on self-esteem in Germany), different levels of challenge during adolescence (e.g., German students have fewer school transitions than American students and therefore might not experience the same challenges that impact the parent-child relationship and the child's self-esteem), the measurement of self-esteem (only 8 of the 10 RSE items were included in the study, and they were rated on a 0-1 scale; thus, a restricted range of scores might have attenuated the correlations), or who is reporting about the parent-child relationship (only child report was available in Germany and perhaps the child's perception is less impactful than the parent's perception, which might be closer to reality). Study 2 addresses many of these limitations testing the longitudinal effect of parent-child closeness on child selfesteem using a U.S. sample, prior to a major life transition (the transition to high school), the full RSE rated on a 5-point Likert scale, and multiple raters of the parent-child relationship (child, parent, observational).",

These families were a part of the Iowa Youth and Families Project (IYFP), an ongoing, longitudinal study that currently has 23 waves of data on four generations (now called Family Transitions Project; see Conger & Conger, 2002) . Families were originally recruited by phone and in person from 34 public and private schools from eight counties in North Central Iowa in communities of fewer than 6,501 people. Seventy-eight percent of the families eligible for the study agreed to participate. The current study uses survey and observational data from the first four waves of IYFP, and thus some data are missing (Wave 1: N = 451; Wave 2: N = 424; Wave 3: N = 407; Wave 4: N = 403-404). Observer-report data had the following sample sizes: 446, 420, 406, and 398, respectively. Trained interviewers visited the homes of the families for approximately 2 hr on two occasions. For the first visit, families completed questionnaires focusing on individual characteristics. During the second visit, the researchers videotaped two structured family interaction tasks. The first task lasted 30 min and involved all four family members (father, mother, target, and sibling). Family members took turns reading and discussing cards that asked general questions about family life. The second task lasted 15 min and also included all four family members. Family members discussed and tried to resolve an issue they had previously identified as being problematic for their family. Independent observers later coded videos for study variables.",

Parent closeness was assessed with six items indicating how the adolescents perceived each of their parents with regard to closeness, attention, and rejection. This scale was adapted from items developed by Kessler and his colleagues that were designed to tap the positive and negative characteristics of social interactions (R. Kessler, personal communication, December 7, 1989) . Items were selected for the current analyses to match the German assessment of parent closeness. Items for child report were: \"How much do you talk to you mom or dad about things that you don't want others to know?\" \"How often does your mom or dad make you feel she or he really cares about you?\" \"How often does your mom or dad make you feel she or he is there for you when you really need her or him?\" \"How often does your mom or dad make you feel tense while you are around her or him?\" \"How often does your mom or dad show concern for your feelings and problems?\" and \"How often does your mom or dad understand the way you feel about things?\" Items for parent report similarly measured relationship quality and trust with children in addition to general feelings about children. For example, items asked the extent to which each parent \"experiences strong feelings of love for his or her child,\" \"is satisfied with his or her relationship with his or her child,\" and \"really trusts his or her child\" (see Results S1, p. 22 for full list of items). Participants rated each item on a 4-or 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 or 5 (strongly agree). POMP scores (Cohen et al., 1999) were created for all items, which were then averaged to create composite scores about mothers and fathers. There were no differences in findings for mothers versus fathers. Therefore, mother and father reports were averaged to create composite parent closeness scores. Cronbach's alpha was high for all measurement occasions: as = .81-.86 for child report; as = .84-.90 for parent report. Means and standard deviations ranged from 76.04 (14.46) at age 13 to 67.16 (16.08) at age 16 for child report and from 80.73 (10.74) at age 13 to 80.38 (12.73) at age 16 for parent report (see Results S1, p. 5 for descriptive statistics at each year).

These variables are associated with individual adjustment and relationship quality (Melby et al., 1998) , and therefore closely map the constructs assessed by the measures completed by children and parents. We used the following variables from Task 1: positive communication, positive assertiveness, prosocial, warmth and support, responsiveness, encourages independence, inconsistent discipline, harsh discipline, indulgent-permissive, quality time, monitoring, positive reinforcement, consistent discipline, parent influence, and inductive reasoning. We used the following variables from Task 2: hostility, or the extent to which hostile, angry, critical, disapproving, or rejecting behavior is directed toward another interactor's behavior, actions, appearance, or personal characteristics; antisocial, or demonstrations of self-centered, egocentric, acting out, and out-of-control behavior that show defiance, active resistance, insensitivity toward others, and lack of constraint, immaturity, age-inappropriate behaviors; and angry coercion, or control attempts that include hostile, threatening, or blaming behavior.

Thus far we have found null effects with multiple longitudinal models that test whether parent closeness impacts the development of self-esteem across adolescence or vice versa. However, there is a robust, positive correlation between self-esteem and parent closeness both in our data and in the extant literature; therefore, the next step is to test whether this correlation represents a spurious relation. That is, whether an environmental, family, parent, or child characteristic can explain the relation between self-esteem and parent closeness. Based on theories of self-esteem we identified and tested several constructs within each of these categories (see Table 3 ). We first tested partial correlations for each construct individually and then for all constructs simultaneously. We found that many of the constructs were concurrently related to self-esteem and parent closeness at each age (see Table 3 , columns 2 and 3 for correlations at age 13). However, partial correlations revealed that no parent characteristics reduced the correlation by more than .02. Child characteristics were more strongly correlated with self-esteem and closeness, but still only accounted for a trivial amount of the correlation between closeness and self-esteem. Results replicated across the next 3 years of adolescence. Next, we tested whether controlling for all 17 constructs simultaneously would have a greater impact on the correlation between self-esteem and closeness. It did, but self-esteem was still moderately related to closeness, and the correlation only declined by .10 on average across the four waves. Finally, this relation held when controlling for prior self-esteem in addition to the 17 constructs (partial rs = .23-.31). Thus, the relation between self-esteem and closeness is not easily explained by the potential third variables we considered.",

In other words, we were unable to \"break\" the cross-sectional association despite our best efforts. This suggests that parents are likely to be a source of self-esteem for individuals but that parent-child closeness is unlikely to be a strong correlate of changes in self-esteem during adolescence.

That is, some developmental processes may operate in a fashion in which an early life relationship or event has a significant impact on an outcome and continues to have an impact through the stability of the outcome over time.

Felson and Zielinski (1989) found some consistent, moderate findings for affection (b = .19, p < .05), praise (b = .23, p < .05), criticism (b = \u00c0.26, p < .05), and sibling favoritism (b = \u00c0.20, p < .05) in a younger age group than was used in the current study, which we discuss below. Thus, we have no compelling reason to suspect that alternative conceptualizations of parenting would reveal significant longitudinal effects in comparable samples to those used in the current study. We also acknowledge that our test of third-variable explanations was selective and by no means exhaustive. In addition to other family, environmental, and personal third variables, shared genetic origins could account for the relation between parent closeness and selfesteem.",

We found evidence that parent-child closeness changed in ways that were consistent with our expectations. However, there was still a considerable degree of rank-order consistency in parent-child relationships as well as self-esteem. Thus, it is possible that there is a relatively enduring dynamic between parents and children that is largely established prior to early adolescence. Thus, larger and more robust effects might be found during early childhood when children are forming their first self-evaluations. Therefore, an interesting area for future research could be to examine the longitudinal effect of parent-child relationships on emerging self-evaluations of young children.",

Future research should examine the longitudinal relations between positive peer relationships and changes in self-esteem. Peers become an increasingly important social factor during adolescence and serve as people with whom adolescents have significant social relationships. Thus, support in peer relationships might be an increasingly impactful factor in self-esteem development during adolescence. However, given that adolescent peer groups rapidly fluctuate (i.e., shift from middle to high school; changing classmates every semester) it could be the case that current peer relationships predict only short-term changes in self-esteem. Furthermore, it could be the case that peer relationships interact with parent relationships to impact self-esteem over time (see Skogbrott Birkeland, Breivik, & Wold, 2013) . Thus, an intriguing area of future research will be to continue to test the importance of peer relationships and the interplay between peer and parent relationships in the development of selfesteem during adolescence. In addition, as the current study did not take into account factors related to parenting such as marital status or stability, future studies should use samples of children with divorced, single, or widowed parents, heightened levels of marital risk, conflict-resolution and problem-solving strategies, as well as other factors that may help capture the complexity of the parent-child relationship and, in turn, its relation with children's self-esteem.",

The few studies that have tested this link have provided inconsistent findings. We found little evidence for prospective associations using a variety of longitudinal models applied to two different data sets. Likewise, we found no evidence that self-esteem has a prospective association with closeness. However, correlations within and across time lags support theory and research that suggests that parent closeness is consistently correlated with adolescent self-esteem, and we were not able to explain this away by testing a variety of third-variable explanations. Three potential areas for future research are to test whether: (a) the relation between parent-child closeness can be explained by common genetic influences, (b) a prospective relation can be found at younger ages, and (c) peer relationships contribute to self-esteem development. Such studies may shed additional light on the developmental antecedents of selfesteem.",
