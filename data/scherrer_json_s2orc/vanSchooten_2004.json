Affect is supposed to be determined by behavioral beliefs or assumed outcomes of the behavior (cognitions) and evaluations of these outcomes. Affect subsequently influences the intended behavior, and the intentions partly determine the actual behavior. Intentions are also influenced by the subjective norm or 'the person's perception of social pressure to perform or not to perform the behavior under consideration' (Ajzen, 1988, p. 117) . The subjective norm of a person is determined by the normative beliefs of the individuals or groups around a person combined with the motivation of the individual to comply with these norms. So the subjective norm is the individual moral stance toward the behavior. In order to account for the influence of the perceived ease of performing the behavior, 'perceived behavioral control' was added to the model, which is thought to be the result of 'control beliefs' or the options someone can see for the realization of the behavior concerned, and 'perceived facilitation' or the problems one foresees in personally realizing the aforementioned options. Control is supposed to influence intentions and it is thought to have a direct effect on the behavior itself. Intentions are considered as directly preceding behavior and therefore as better predictors of behavior than cognitions, affect, subjective norm or perceived behavioral control.",

Students of all four streams of Dutch secondary education were included: vocational, lower general, higher general and preacademic. Students in vocational and lower general secondary education appeared to read much less and have lower attitude scores than students in the two highest streams. Furthermore, students in higher grades scored significantly lower on affect, subjective norm and intentions than students in lower grades and girls scored higher on cognition, affect, and intentions, and spent more time reading adolescent literature than boys. The utility of the MPB for measuring the attitude towards reading adolescent literature would be improved if the validity of the instrument could also be demonstrated for older students and for students that show less variability in their attitude and reading behavior than those in Van Schooten and De Glopper (2002) . For the present study, we administered the attitude instrument based on the MPB to students in grades 7-11 of higher general and preacademic secondary education only. So we investigated older students and students who on average read more than those in the sample of Van Schooten and De Glopper (2002) .",

Students indicated on Likert scales how often a given action or topic appears in their literary education lessons. 3 The instruments for measuring vocabulary size, the amount of reading fictional texts, the number of mother-tongue lessons per week, the number of lessons in literary education per week and the kind of literary education participants received were administered each of the three measurement moments.

In Van Schooten and De Glopper (2002) , the participants of the study were students of all four streams of secondary education in grades 7-9. The standardized regression weight of cognition on affect amounted to .85 and the standardized regression weight of affect on intentions was as high as .96. Subsequently, the standardized regression weight of intentions on behavior was .47. Control and subjective norm were found to have very weak relations with intentions (standardized regression weights of \u00c0.04 and .11, respectively). The regression weight of control on behavior was .16. It is clear that for these students the prediction of behavior from intentions, affect and cognition was much better than for the students in the present study.

The diminishing trend was already made plausible for all students in secondary education from grades 7 to 9 (Van Schooten and De Glopper, 2002) . Looking at the results of this study, some questions arise. The first question that comes to mind is, where does the diminishing trend stop? As we all know, some adults do like reading fiction. Did these readers regain a positive attitude and if so, at what age? Or did these people's attitude towards reading never decline in the first place? Also, it would be interesting to investigate which background variables are responsible for the restoration or perhaps continuation of a positive reading attitude in adult life and whether for some individuals there is a positive rather than a negative development in literary reading attitude and literary reading behavior.",

It could also be that because of a greater intelligence some students read more and have larger vocabularies. To verify the causal chain we hypothesize a randomized experiment could be used in which the experimental group receives a stimulation program to make them read more fiction. Given the results of this study, the participants in such a study should just be entering secondary education or be students in the higher grades of primary education. Also, it is clear that to make students read, affect is the most promising aspect of the MPB to aim at, see also Van Schooten and De Glopper (2002) . The main argument for students to read is that they like to read. The aim of the treatment of such a study should be to find the books that each individual child in the study would like to read, irrespective of literary quality, subject, etc. Since reading proficiency is a key variable in the theory concerning the Matthew effect, in the same study the effects of reading fiction on the development of comprehensive reading skill and consequently on educational performance could be measured.",

The questionnaires for measuring the amount of text experiencing, structural analysis and literary history asked students to indicate the frequency with which specified subject matters are treated in their literary-education lessons. It could be that students who perform poorly in literary education have more problems recognizing the different aspects mentioned. If so, error variance is correlated with true scores and possibly it is not only the character of the literary education lessons, but also some proficiency that is measured. Three cross sectional covariance structure analyses, one for each moment of measurement. All parameters constrained to be equal in both groups (cohort 1 and cohort 2). a The sample sizes in this table are larger than in Table 1 . The reason is that we assumed data to be 'missing at random' and could therefore use the Full Information Maximum Likelihood procedure (see Muth\u00e9n et al., 1987) as implemented in Mplus, in which all cases are included in the analysis. We do not assume data to be 'missing completely at random' which would imply that there is no selective mortality. Missing at random means that missing data can be estimated from other, non-missing, data in the file. In a simulation study by Enders and Bandalos (2001) , the Full Information Maximum Likelihood procedure produced better estimates than naive methods, such as pair-wise or list-wise deletion. In brief, the procedure sorts the observations into missing data patterns, each pattern being consequently automatically analyzed in a multiple group design with the appropriate constraints across groups. Thus, the same model is estimated for all groups, and subjects with missing data are not removed from the analysis. The parameters of the model fit of the first moment of measurement (grade 7 of cohort 1 and grade 9 of cohort 2). Translated items, regression weights (r.w.; constrained to be equal in both grades) and critical ratios or z-scores (c.r.). For model identification one item factor loading per latent variable was fixed at a value of one. This means that for these items no z-score could be computed. The one-sided significance levels for the z-scores: P <.05 if z > 1.96; P <.01 if z > 2.52; P <.001 if z > 3.30; P <.0001 if z > 3.90. a Standardised regression weights are not identical in both groups (cohort one and two), since the variances may differ. Both standardised regression weights, of cohort one and two, respectively, are presented.",
