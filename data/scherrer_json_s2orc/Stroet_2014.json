                "text": "Notions of what learning consists of have changed in modern society. Traditionally, much emphasis has been on learning as reproduction of knowledge that results from a process of transmission. In modern views of learning, such a focus on the transmission of knowledge is no longer considered sufficient. Rather, it is emphasised that for learning to occur, students have to build up and combine their prior knowledge with new knowledge and restructure and reconsider their own understanding (Marshall, 1988; Shuell, 1996) . Modern societal demands have also shifted away from the idea of having knowledge towards being equipped for life-long self-regulated learning (Minnaert & Vermunt, 2006) . Over the past decades, many schools have adapted their learning environments to incorporate these modern views on learning, often as a part of social constructivist educational reform (Boekaerts, de Koning, & Vedder, 2006) . Although there are many differences among social constructivist schools, what these types of schools share is a focus on assisting students in the regulation and organisation of their own learning processes, thereby standing in contrast to more traditional schools in which the teachers are expected to take a large degree of responsibility for students' learning processes.",

For many students, however, motivation for school declines after making the transition to secondary education (e.g. Anderman & Maehr, 1994; Gottfried, Fleming, & Gottfried, 2001; Opdenakker, Maulana, & Den Brok, 2012; Peetsma, Hascher, Van der Veen, & Roede, 2005; Van der Werf, Opdenakker, & Kuyper, 2008; Wigfield, Byrnes, & Eccles, 2006) . It is increasingly recognised that the learning environment can play an important role in enhancing students' motivation (Pintrich, 2004) , and social constructivist educational reforms have been implemented with this explicit aim in mind (e.g. Lea, Stephenson, & Troy, 2003; Oostdam, Peetsma, Derriks, & van Gelderen, 2006) . In the US, for example, educational reforms incorporating social constructivist views were implemented with the purpose of enhancing the motivation of students after their transition to middle school (grades 6-8; Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development, 1989) and high school (grades 9-12; National Research Council, 2004) .",

Ultimately, such research should be conducted in the schools themselves, as applying an educational philosophy in practice tends to have much wider consequences than accounted for in theory (Slavin, 2012) . In the present study, we investigated the degree to which the level and development of early adolescents' motivation is associated with the type of school they attend. A unique asset of this study is that we compared three types of schools: Prototypically traditional schools, prototypically social constructivist schools and schools combining elements of both educational philosophies. For this purpose, we measured the motivation of students attending these different types of schools at five points in time over the course of their first year after the transition to Dutch secondary education (grade 7). The context of Dutch education is of interest as it consists in a variety of schools that can be characterised by distinct underlying educational philosophies. Within this spectrum, traditional and social constructivist schools represent two contrasting types.",

In comparison to social constructivist views, much less emphasis is put on fostering student motivation. In line with traditional notions of learning, teachers are expected to take a large degree of responsibility for students' learning processes, not only explaining subject matter but also structuring the course material itself, as well as the way in which it is provided (Boekaerts & Niemivirta, 2000; Bolhuis & Voeten, 2001; Gibbs, 1992) . Ideally, students should be guided systematically through a series of exercises (Doyle, 1983) until they have reached the learning goals set by the teacher. The teacher is conceived of as an authority, who disseminates knowledge, largely through lectures and verbal exchanges (Shuell, 1996) , while students are expected to focus on the receipt of knowledge, whereupon they practice assigned exercises individually or in small groups (Greeno et al., 1996; Prince, 2004) . Typically, identical exercises are assigned to the class as a whole. In traditional learning environments, tasks are often decontextualised in order to avoid distraction by irrelevant stimuli (Greeno et al., 1996) . Finally, the function of assessment is considered to lie in monitoring how much students have learned and providing them with prompt feedback on the quality of their performance (Greeno et al., 1996) .",

                "text": "After the cognitive revolution of the 1970s, constructivist views on learning started to gain prominence in education (Marshall, 1988; Shuell, 1996) , emphasising that learners construct meaning in an active way, and challenging the value of fragmentary, passive learning (Oxford, 1997) . These views have been incorporated into the educational philosophy of social constructivism that in the past decades has gained prominence in theory on learning and instruction (Shuell, 1996) . In social constructivism, knowledge is considered to be co-constructed; a view that is shared by the multiple theories that have been developed (Windschitl, 2002 ; see Prawat, 2009 for a discussion of these theories). We use the term social constructivism to refer to the theory that has emerged in convergence with the work of theorists such as Vygotsky (1962 Vygotsky ( , 1978 , as well as the modern cognitive science perspective (see Hickey, 1997; Shuell, 1996) . In social constructivist views, student motivation is considered central to learning. Instruction should be focused on assisting students in organising and regulating their own learning processes, thereby leaving them with a large degree of responsibility for the cognitive and metacognitive aspects of their learning (Gibbs, 1992) . Ideally, a gradual transfer of learning functions from teachers to students is realised (Boekaerts, 2002; Shuell, 1996; Vermunt & Verloop, 1999) . Implied in the notion that students should be assisted in self-regulating their learning is the importance of fostering student motivation. This becomes clear from the definition of self-regulated learning put forward by Zimmerman (1986) , as consisting in students being metacognitively, motivationally and behaviourally active participants in their own learning process. The importance of 'learning to learn' is also emphasised, in addition to attaining the learning products (e.g. knowledge and skills).",

In social constructivist learning environments, tasks are often contextualised, with learning taking place within an authentic context and students provided with opportunities for domain-related practice.

First, the notion that students should perceive their learning processes as their own responsibility rather than someone else's is in line with the idea that students should regulate their motivation internally. Second, the notion that learning occurs through the construction of knowledge entails the importance of deep approaches to learning (as put forward by Marton, 1976; S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 1975) .

As these are the constructs social constructivist educational reforms aim at fostering, for the purpose of the present study we focus on four such constructs that constitute a broad representation of components of internally regulated motivation (for a comprehensive overview of motivational constructs, the interested reader is referred to the handbook on motivation by Wentzel & Wigfield, 2009) . The first three constructs we focus on represent distinct components of internally regulated motivation. First, intrinsic motivation refers to motivation for behaviour that is experienced as inherently satisfying. Second, identified motivation refers to motivation for behaviour of which the consequences are considered to be personally valuable (Deci & Ryan, 1985) . Third, students' values denote the degree to which students perceive a task to be personally valuable; thereby, values are closely related to identified motivation. The fourth motivational construct represents a prerequisite for intrinsic motivation, as research has consistently indicated the negative effects of performance avoidance goals on students' intrinsic motivation and achievement (e.g. Elliot & Murayama, 2008) . Performance avoidance refers to avoidance of situations where students fear that others will notice their shortcomings.",

Based on the wide array of literature on social constructivist instruction summarised above, we formulated criteria to classify schools as social constructivist in the Dutch context (Oostdam et al., 2006) . Schools were classified as 'prototypically social constructivist' when they met all of five criteria and had worked in accordance with social constructivist views for at least several years. According to these criteria, social constructivist learning environments can be distinguished from traditional learning environments in terms of: (1) more attention paid to the higher order skills of self-regulation and metacognition, (2) students share responsibility for their own learning process and the learning goals they choose, (3) more formative than summative evaluation methods are used to evaluate students' work, (4) learning takes place within an authentic context and (5) learning is considered to be a social activity.",

Schools belonging to this type scored relatively high on criteria 1-3 for social constructivist learning environments (although lower than prototypical social constructivist schools) as well as on the first two criteria for traditional learning environments (although lower than prototypical traditional schools).

As mentioned above, ultimately such research should be conducted in the schools themselves, as applying an educational philosophy in practice tends to have much wider consequences than accounted for in theory (Slavin, 2012) . The lack of evidence on social constructivist schools is problematic in particular, because constructivist views on learning have been developed further than views on instruction (Windschitl, 2002) , and because the implementation of constructivist reforms in practice tends to confront teachers with a set of dilemmas (see Windschitl, 2002 for an overview). Below, we provide a review of available empirical evidence that is of relevance in answering the question of the effectiveness of social constructivist as well as traditional and combined schools.

For example, research has indicated that students working on self-selected tasks are more likely to use strategies voluntarily, to persist when work becomes difficult and to maintain their focus on academic work (Turner, 1995) . In addition, students have been found to be more cognitively engaged when assigned independent work that requires monitoring and planning (Blumenfeld & Meece, 1988) , while students who were allowed to set personal goals for their learning reported higher levels of intrinsic motivation (e.g. Benware & Deci, 1984) . In a study by Grolnick and Ryan (1987) , it was shown that students who were asked to learn material for a test reported lower interest in the task. Furthermore, empirical evidence indicated that long-term, problem-focused and meaningful units of instruction positively affected student motivation (Blumenfeld et al., 1991) . Finally, Turner et al. (2002) found scaffolding within instruction to be positively associated with student reports of low avoidance behaviours.",

Specifically, ambivalent teacher adherence was found to be associated with a larger increase in performance anxiety than weak teacher adherence. Second, in a study on the effects of the large-scale educational reform proposed by the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development (1989), Felner and Jackson (1997) emphasised the importance of comprehensive implementation, as schools that had implemented only part of the recommendations were not found to be successful.",

Research has indicated positive effects of characteristics that are more overt in traditional than in social constructivist views on instruction. Of particular relevance in this respect is that research has consistently indicated the crucial importance of 'structured teaching', including communicating clear expectations and providing students with prompt feedback and reinforcement (e.g. Opdenakker & Minnaert, 2011; Perry, Turner, & Meyer, 2006; Scheerens & Bosker, 1997) . In addition, of relevance here is that in the educational literature social constructivist schools have been criticised, with the main criticism being that they tend to provide students with too little instructional guidance (Anderson, Reder, & Simon, 2000; Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark, 2006; Mayer, 2004) . While social constructivist theory considers the provision of sufficient guidance to be an explicit aim of instruction (see also Oostdam, Peetsma, & Blok, 2007) , it might well be that when implementing such an approach in practice, provision of too little instructional guidance is a potential risk.",

In conversations with the heads of departments, it was established that the teachers of math and mother language in the participating classes were representative of their schools. All 20 participating classes were at the prevocational level of Dutch secondary education ('vmbo'). Furthermore, all 20 classes were grade 7, which, in the Netherlands, is the first grade after the transition to secondary education. Students attending this grade are aged from 12 to 13. Parent(s)/guardian(s) of the students were sent information by mail prior to the start of the study, which informed them that they could at any time and without further explanation decide not to grant permission for their child to participate or continue to participate (as did the parent(s)/ guardian(s) of one student prior to the start of the study).",

Geographically, these schools were spread across the Netherlands, with the exclusion of the south. For the selection of these schools, we followed a procedure consisting of four steps, using the criteria as described in the introduction. Initially, we included all schools in the central and northern parts of the Netherlands that were non-religious, public (as are nearly all schools in the Netherlands) and offered prevocational education (a total of 141 schools). Schools in the southern part of the Netherlands were excluded for pragmatic reasons, while religious schools were excluded because it would have been difficult to match the types of schools on the basis of denomination. The first step involved coding relevant information available through the websites of schools. Based on these coding, we excluded schools from the selection that clearly were neither traditional, social constructivist, nor combined (e.g. Montessori schools), and we provisionally categorised the remaining schools as being potentially 'social constructivist', 'traditional' or 'combined', or as 'unknown based on website-information'.",

In the Netherlands, the school year starts and ends at different dates depending on the school's location (either one or two weeks apart from each other), which was taken into account in our planning. On each measurement occasion, students were administered questionnaires which gathered information on their motivation for math and mother language, focusing on four motivational constructs. The questionnaires were Educational Psychology administered during a regular class by student mentors. On each measurement occasion, the mentors received a letter containing standardised instructions to guide the students through the questionnaires. The mentors were instructed not to check the students' answers and it was also made clear to the latter that all of the data would be processed anonymously.

For this purpose, we compared the scores on the first measurement between the students who had filled in the questionnaire and the students who had not filled in the questionnaire for each measurement occasion, motivational construct and subject. When significant differences were found, we checked whether these differences remained when comparisons were made within school types, respectively, schools. Generally, these comparisons did not reveal the existence of meaningful differences between students with and without missing data; except for the fifth measurement occasion in one of the prototypically social constructivist schools. In this school, students who missed the fifth measurement occasion had scored significantly lower on the first measurements of intrinsic motivation and identified motivation for math. In the interpretation of the results, violation of the assumption of missingness at random should be taken into consideration; however, the impact will be small as the assumption appeared violated for the fifth measurement occasion and for one prototypically social constructivist school only.",

The educational philosophies that encompass traditional and social constructivist views represent such distinct traditions that they can be contrasted on many aspects. Nevertheless, both continue to have an effect on current educational practice in Western countries to a large degree. In the present study, we investigated the degree to which the level and development of student motivation is associated with the type of school they attend: A prototypical social constructivist school, a prototypical traditional school or a school combining elements of both educational philosophies. We focused on early adolescents in their first year after transition to prevocational secondary education, as motivation for school has been found to decline for this group. Corroborating prior evidence (Minnaert, 2013; Opdenakker & Van Damme, 2000) , we found meaningful differences between (school) classes, although most variance in student motivation appeared attributable to the student and occasion levels. First, regarding students' general levels of motivation, we found meaningful differences between classes on all four motivational constructs that were the focus of the present studyintrinsic motivation, identified motivation, values and performance avoidancefor mother language, and even more so for math. In answer to the first part of our research question, we found that for most of these motivational constructs, students' levels were associated with the type of school they attended. The levels of intrinsic motivation for mother language, and values for math and mother language were lower in combined schools than in the other two types of schools, while for identified motivation for math and mother language and intrinsic motivation for math, this same trend approached significance. The levels of performance avoidance were not found to differ between types of schools.",

It is important to realise in this respect that the meaning of the development of a construct over time might depend upon its initial level; for example, a decline in student motivation might be more detrimental when the initial level was relatively low as opposed to relatively high. Among possible explanations for these findings is that whereas the type of school students attend does affect their motivation, this effect has largely crystallised when students have been at their new school for a few weeks. An alternative explanation could be that the effects on the development of student motivation over time are too complex to determine over the course of one school year, which could have been further complicated by, for example, differences in timing of assignments or examinations between schools. Future research is necessary to explain these findings further.",

As we will elaborate on below, this finding could be interpreted as being due to a selection bias. Alternatively, it could be argued that this finding corroborates previous empirical evidence that demonstrates the importance of the comprehensive implementation of social constructivist reforms (Felner & Jackson, 1997; Rozendaal et al., 2005) . In the present study, we compared schools that were prototypically traditional, prototypically social constructivist and schools that had characteristics of both educational philosophies. The schools of one or the other specific types shared the fact that they worked in accordance with a specific educational philosophy and, therefore, that they tended to maintain an unambiguous view on education. It could be speculated that in schools that combine characteristics of different educational philosophies, views on education tend to be less crystallised and, therefore, teachers' adherence to respective educational principles is more ambivalent. It has been argued that such ambivalence can be potentially detrimental to students' learning (Minnaert, 2013) and can cause, for example, less clear communication of expectations, while clear communication has been suggested to be a particularly effective characteristic of educational practice (see Boekaerts & Minnaert, 2003; Perry et al., 2006) .",

For example, having students share responsibility for their own learning process and the learning goals they choose (Criterion 2 for social constructivist learning environments) combined with relatively little attention to the higher order skills of self-regulation and metacognition (Criterion 1 for social constructivist learning environments) will for many students result in a lack of instructional guidance. As we elaborated on in the introduction, social constructivist instruction has been criticised for tending to provide students with too little instructional guidance. It could be speculated that the students' lower levels of motivation in combined schools were due to lack of instructional guidance being a potential risk of implementing aspects of social constructivist educational reform in particular.",

One of the most difficult challenges in evaluating differences between schools is to separate the effects of schooling from the intake characteristics of the students who attend the school (Raudenbush & Willms, 1995) . First, the relatively small number of schools (ten) participating in the present study can be considered a drawback in this sense, as coincidental differences between the schools might have influenced the results. We attempted to at least partially counteract this problem by matching participating schools on key criteria and focusing on students with comparable levels of prior achievement. Second, a particular difficulty that is always apparent when comparing types of schools is that students tend to be sorted into these different types of schools not by random selection processes, but based on their own preferences, as well as of those of their parents or guardians.",

                "text": "In conclusion, despite these limitations, the results of the present study provide further insight into the effectiveness of traditional, social constructivist and combined schools in fostering early adolescents' motivation. Such insight is crucial for evaluating educational policy and is of particular relevance considering the large number of schools in Western countries that have incorporated social constructivist views on instruction. The results point, for example, towards the potential risk of something that is common practice: Combining elements of distinct educational philosophies. Interestingly, despite prior research having shown that distinct characteristics of social constructivist instruction are effective in fostering student motivation, our findings do not support the notion that social constructivist schools are more effective than traditional schools (or vice versa). This contrast in the findings seems to confirm the notion that applying an educational philosophy in practice tends to have much wider consequences than accounted for in theory (Slavin, 2012) . Finally, our findings support the notion that the learning environment can play an important role in fostering early adolescents' motivation, and thereby they affirm the importance of future research into the characteristics of this environment. One consequence of the present study's focus on schools that actually worked in accordance with different educational philosophies is that in the interpretation of our findings we cannot readily distinguish between factors inherent in the respective educational philosophies (traditional, social constructivist and combined) and factors that are not inherent but which have indirectly resulted from these educational philosophies. For example, above we suggested that the relatively low levels of student motivation in combined schools were perhaps caused by contradictions inherent in the educational philosophy of this type of school, and/or in the teachers being more ambivalent in their adherence as an indirect result of the educational philosophy. While the former explanation would lead to the advice that combined schools stop combining elements of traditional and social constructivist views in their education, the latter explanation would lead to the advice that combined schools implement school-based interventions that train their teachers to express unambiguous views on instruction or provide coaching to schools that are, for example, in transition from a traditional to a social constructivist approach. For future research, we would recommend a focus on daily practices in the different types of schools, which will help determine the level at which there should be intervention. Such research would also be of particular relevance in providing further insight into the link between educational theory on learning and instruction and its implications in practice.",

It would be of interest, however, to investigate whether our findings can be generalised to boys and girls belonging to other age groups as well. Furthermore, it would be of interest do cross-cultural comparisons, as research indicates the importance of culturally responsive pedagogies in the classroom (see Savage, Hindle, Meyer, Hynds, Penetito, & Sleeter, 2011) . Finally, it would be of interest to include more outcome measures in any future research. In the present study, we chose to focus on motivation because of its relevance to the aims of social constructivist instruction as well as its recognised importance as a prerequisite for student learning.
