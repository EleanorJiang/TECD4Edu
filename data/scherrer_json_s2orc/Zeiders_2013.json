    "abstract": "The current longitudinal study examined changes in Latino adolescents' (N \u03ed 323, M age \u03ed 15.31 years) self-esteem and depressive symptoms across the high school years. Differences in trajectories were examined by gender and perceived ethnic discrimination. Findings revealed that self-esteem increased across high school for both male adolescents and female adolescents. Depressive symptoms, however, showed differences by gender, with female adolescents reporting a decline in depressive symptoms across high school and male adolescents reporting no change. Perceived ethnic discrimination emerged as an important predictor of male adolescents' self-esteem in early high school and predicted changes in self-esteem growth for male adolescents and female adolescents across the high school years. Perceived ethnic discrimination also emerged as a significant predictor of adolescents' depressive symptoms in early high school but did not relate to changes in symptoms across time. Together, findings suggest that Latino adolescents experience positive changes in psychological adjustment across this developmental time. Experiences of ethnic discrimination, however, have the potential of placing adolescents at risk for maladjustment over time. These findings inform our understanding of Latino youth development and point to the importance of early high school years in youths' psychological functioning.",

                "text": "Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by numerous cognitive, biological, and social changes. The challenges associated with these changes are theorized to take a toll on individuals' psychological functioning, including impacting self-esteem and increasing individuals' susceptibility to depressive symptoms (Cicchetti, Rogosch, & Toth, 1994; Mruk, 2006) . Self-esteem and depressive symptoms during adolescence not only shape youths' immediate context but also play an important role later in life. Lower levels of self-esteem in adolescence have been related to greater mental health problems and substance abuse and to lower levels of life satisfaction in early adulthood (Boden, Fergusson, & Horwood, 2008) . Similarly, higher levels of depressive symptomatology during adolescence have been linked to early adulthood depressive and anxiety disorders (Fergusson, Boden, & Horwood, 2007) , poor overall health (Keenan-Miller, Hammen, & Brennan, 2007) , and sexual risk taking (Bonomo et al., 2001 ). Because of their links to later adjustment, researchers have begun to examine the developmental progression of self-esteem and depressive symptoms during adolescence, with attention to gender differences and the role of environmental factors in shaping trajectories (e.g., Baldwin & Hoffman, 2002; Ge, Conger, & Elder, 2001; Scheier, Botvin, Griffin, & Diaz, 2000) .",

Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic minority group in the United States (Fry, 2008) , with estimates suggesting that by 2050 nearly 29% of the U.S. population will be Latino (Passel & Cohn, 2008) . The Latino population also is relatively young; the mean age of the Latino population is 27 years old, younger than African Americans (31 years old), Asians (36 years old) and European Americans (41 years old; Pew Hispanic Center, 2009) . Further, evidence suggests that Latino adolescents are at greater risk for developing mental health disorders, compared with European Americans (Gore & Aseltine, 2003; Twenge & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2002) . As such, a better understanding of developmental changes in key indicators of adjustment, such as self-esteem and depressive symptoms, in Latino adolescents is greatly needed.",

Despite theoretical advances in this area, few empirical studies have examined how perceptions of ethnic discrimination relate to the development of Latino youths' psychological functioning longitudinally (see Greene, Way, & Pahl, 2006 , for an exception). To address these gaps in the literature, the current study had three primary goals: (a) describe Latino adolescents' trajectories of self-esteem and depressive symptoms across the high school years, (b) examine gender differences in trajectories of self-esteem and depressive symptoms, and (c) examine how perceived ethnic discrimination was associated with youths' trajectories of self-esteem and depressive symptoms.",

These studies, however, have relied primarily on cross-sectional data, and the extent to which cohort effects contribute to these differences is therefore unclear. To achieve a more accurate understanding of the developmental progression of self-esteem, assessments of intraindividual change across time are needed. The few existing longitudinal studies have reported mixed findings or have examined a restricted range of time, which limits our ability to compare across studies. For instance, Scheier and colleagues (2000) examined European American adolescents from seventh to 10th grade and found declines in both male adolescents' and female adolescents' self-esteem over time. In contrast, Baldwin and Hoffman (2002) examined European American adolescents, from ages 12 years (sixth or seventh grade) to 20 years and found that male participants and female participants increased in self-esteem from middle to late adolescence (16 -20 years old). Finally, Block and Robins (1993) found that female participants' and male participants' selfesteem trajectories differed from 15 years old to 23 years old, with female participants reporting decreases and male participants reporting increases.",

It should be noted, however, that these findings are based largely on studies with European American adolescents (e.g., Baldwin & Hoffman, 2002; Scheier et al., 2000; Galambos, Baker, & Krahn, 2006) . The few studies that have included ethnic and racial minority adolescents have found significant differences between ethnic and racial groups in trajectories of self-esteem (Biro, Striegel-Moore, Franko, Padgett, & Bean, 2006; Greene & Way, 2005) . For instance, Greene and Way (2005) found that Black, Latino, Asian American, and biracial youths all reported significant increases in self-esteem from ages 13 years to 20 years, but Latino adolescents reported significantly lower levels of selfesteem at age 13 years than did Black adolescents and demonstrated significantly faster growth over time, reaching comparable levels of self-esteem to Black adolescents at age 20. These findings suggest that there might be important differences in the development of self-esteem across racial and ethnic groups and that the trajectories that have been identified for European American adolescents cannot be generalized to youths from other ethnic and racial groups without empirical examination. Research examining the trajectories of self-esteem among Latino youths is greatly needed, given the substantial population growth and prior evidence suggesting that these adolescents are at risk for relatively poor psychological outcomes (Gore & Aseltine, 2003; Twenge & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2002) .",

Latino culture has been characterized by a strong adherence to traditional gender roles, which impacts individuals' gender socialization process (Abreu, Goodyear, Campos, & Newcomb, 2000; Azmitia & Brown, 2002) . In fact, Latinos have been found to report greater adherence to traditional gender roles than have members of other ethnic/racial groups in the United States (e.g., Abreu et al., 2000) . These values are believed to be passed down from parents to adolescents, with more traditional parents encouraging male adolescents to engage in more \"manly\" behaviors and with femininity encouraged in female adolescents (Raffaelli & Ontai, 2004) . As previously mentioned, gender differences in self-esteem during adolescence have been explained, in part, by mainstream societal views that tend to favor stereotypically masculine behaviors. Thus, in a culture that strongly adheres to rigid gender role socialization, such as the Latino culture, it is possible that gender differences might be amplified. That is, Latino male adolescents might be particularly likely to report significantly higher levels of self-esteem than their female counterparts because their cultural orientation aligns with the larger societal values. Thus, because both the heritage culture (i.e., Latino) and the mainstream culture favor stereotypical masculine behaviors, Latino male adolescents may benefit from traditional gender role socialization and expectations. The current study contributes to narrowing this gap in the literature by empirically examining the trajectories of Latino male adolescents' and female adolescents' self-esteem during the high school years.",

Depressive disorders and increased depressive symptoms appear to be especially relevant to Latinos, as studies have suggested that these adolescents are at increased risk of experiencing depressive symptoms, compared with other adolescents (Anderson & Mayes, 2010) . Theories of depressive disorders suggest that many of the changes occurring during adolescence contribute to adolescents experiencing depressive symptoms and to the development of depression (Hankin, 2006; Lewinsohn & Essau, 2002) . Specifically, individuals are tasked with the goals of adapting to the numerous changes associated with puberty, having peer relationships with members of the opposite sex, and forming a sense of personal identity (Cicchetti et al., 1994) . Difficulty in adjusting can leave adolescents with limited resources, increased conflict, and other problems in interpersonal relationships, which ultimately make adolescents vulnerable to experiencing depressive symptoms and developing a depressive disorder. Depressive symptoms are more common in female adolescents than in male adolescents, as nearly twice as many female adolescents are diagnosed with depression, compared with male adolescents (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1990) . Paralleling explanations of gender differences in self-esteem, some theories of depression focus on gender role development (Hill & Lynch, 1983) . Specifically, after puberty, female adolescents face increased pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and become less assertive, which in turn is related to a less positive view of one's self and to increased depressive symptoms. Other theories have focused more on environmental stressors (Nolen-Hoeksema & Girgus, 1994) , positing that differences are likely due to the increased exposure and/or increased reactivity to stressors for female adolescents, compared with male adolescents. Although the exact mechanisms underlying differences are not understood, gender remains an important consideration in understanding adolescents' development of depressive symptoms.",

                "text": "Though there are a few studies that have examined depressive symptoms throughout adolescence, similar to the literature on self-esteem, most of this work is based on cross-sectional data. Findings from these studies imply significant gender differences, with female adolescents demonstrating higher levels of depressive symptoms in late adolescence, compared with early adolescence, and male adolescents reporting stability or decreases in depressive symptoms across these same developmental periods (Petersen, Sarigiani, & Kennedy, 1991) . The few studies that have examined intraindividual changes in depressive symptoms across adolescence, however, have produced somewhat inconsistent findings with respect to when male adolescents' and female adolescents' trajectories of depressive symptomatology converge and diverge. For instance, Ge, Conger, and Elder (2001) examined European American high school students' trajectories of depressive symptoms from seventh to twelfth grade. Female adolescents reported an increase in depressive symptoms from eighth to 12th grade, while male adolescents reported a decline from eighth to ninth grade but an increase from 10th to 12th grade. In a second study, Garber and colleagues (2002) found that female adolescents reported an increase in depressive symptoms from sixth to 11th grade, while their male counterparts reported no change during this time. Although the findings by Ge et al., and Garber et al. were based on predominately European American samples, a recent study (i.e., Adkins, Wang, Dupre, van den Oord, & Elder, 2009) found that Latino and European American youths demonstrated similar trajectories of depressive symptoms, increasing from middle adolescence (i.e., seventh grade) to about age 17 years and then declining into young adulthood. However, Latinos and female adolescents started at greater levels of depression (at seventh grade), compared with European Americans and male adolescents, respectively. Given the limited number of studies that have examined intraindividual change in depressive symptoms, however, it is difficult to draw conclusions from this work. Nevertheless, one consistent finding is that trajectories of depressive symptoms during adolescence differ for male and female adolescents, and variability by gender should be considered in this work. Given that depressive symptomatology represents a significant public health concern (O'Connell, Boat, & Warner, 2009) and that Latinos appear to be at relatively greater risk for exhibiting depressive symptoms than are European American and other racial/ethnic minority youths (Anderson & Mayes, 2010; Mikolajczyk, Bredehorst, Khelaifat, Maier, & Maxwell, 2007) , it is necessary to gain a more complete understanding of the developmental changes in depressive symptoms among this population.",

                "text": "During adolescence, individuals face a number of stressful events that influence their psychosocial functioning. For ethnic minority adolescents living in the United States, these events include experiences of ethnic discrimination or mistreatment based on preconceived stereotypes and biases (Fisher, Wallace, & Fenton, 2000) . These events are frequent, as some studies have suggested that nearly 50% of adolescents report daily experiences (e.g., Fisher et al., 2000) . For Latinos, specifically, recent attention has been given to the unique experiences of discrimination that include mistreatment based on differences from the majority culture on language and, in the case of individuals born outside the United States, immigration status (Dovidio, Gluszek, John, Ditlmann, & Lagunes, 2010) . Although the Latino population comprises individuals from diverse ethnic origins, in the context of the United States, Latinos are categorized (e.g., U.S. Census categorization) and considered to be a monolithic ethnic group. The social construction of a pan ethnic Latino ethnicity in the U.S. context makes certain experiences, such as ethnic discrimination, somewhat of a shared experience for members of an otherwise diverse population. As an example, recent research suggests that Latinos of varying ethnic origins and immigration statuses have reported perceiving greater levels of ethnic discrimination due to the increased focus on immigration in the United States (Lopez, Morin, & Taylor, 2010) . As the integrative model of minority health suggests, these perceptions of ethnic discrimination are theorized to play a key role in developmental processes by disrupting immediate psychological functioning and having lasting effects over time (DuBois et al., 2002; Garc\u00eda Coll et al., 1996) .",

Adolescents, in turn, develop a greater awareness of biases and ethnic discrimination at an interpersonal level, leading to increased perceptions of ethnic discrimination. Theory also suggests that perceptions of ethnic discrimination have the potential of impacting individuals' functioning. For instance, social identity theory suggests that adolescence is a time during which individuals undergo identity changes that are directly related to self-concept. Identities are based on social categories (e.g., ethnicity, nationality) in which individuals have a sense of belonging (Hogg, Terry, & White, 1995; Tajfel & Turner, 1986) ; for ethnic minority adolescents, these social categories often include their identification with their own ethnic group (Uma\u00f1a-Taylor, Yazedjian, & B\u00e1maca-Gomez, 2004) . Experiences with ethnic discrimination, in which one's ethnic group is devalued, can then pose a significant threat to one's self-esteem (Uma\u00f1a-Taylor & Updegraff, 2007) . Furthermore, from a stress process perspective, discriminatory experiences are theorized to take a toll on individuals' functioning both physiologically and psychologically and through numerous pathways (e.g., rumination, hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis activation) resulting in increased depressive symptoms (Pachter & Garc\u00eda Coll, 2009) .",

For instance, Smokowski and Bacallao (2007) found that Latino adolescents' reports of perceived ethnic discrimination were related to lower self-esteem and greater internalizing symptoms. Further, prospective studies of Mexicanorigin adolescents have found that perceptions of ethnic discrimination contribute to increases in depressive symptoms and decreases in academic self-efficacy, grades, and self-esteem over time (e.g., Berkel et al., 2010) . To our knowledge, only one empirical study exists examining how perceived ethnic discrimination shapes the development (or trajectories) of psychological functioning. Among Black, Latino (primarily Dominican), and Asian American adolescents, Greene and colleagues (2006) found that perceptions of ethnic discrimination were associated with decreases in self-esteem and increases in depressive symptoms across the high school years. These findings suggest that perceived ethnic discrimination has the potential of shaping minority youths' trajectories of psychological functioning. To expand our understanding of these processes among Latino adolescents, however, research that examines potential within-group variability is needed (Garc\u00eda Coll et al., 1996) .",

                "text": "Adolescent gender is one aspect of within group variability that deserves a more nuanced examination, particularly with respect to examining the impact of perceived ethnic discrimination on psychological functioning over time. Findings suggest that male participants report greater perceptions of ethnic/racial discrimination than do female participants (e.g., Chavous, Rivas-Drake, Smalls, Griffin, & Cogburn, 2008) , and some evidence suggests that male participants are more greatly impacted by these experiences than are female participants. For instance, male participants report a greater link between perceived ethnic discrimination and smoking (Wiehe, Aalsma, Liu, & Fortenberry, 2010) , academic outcomes (Alfaro, Uma\u00f1a-Taylor, Gonzales-Backen, B\u00e1maca, & Zeiders, 2009) , risk behavior (Delgado, Updegraff, Roosa, & Uma\u00f1a-Taylor, 2011) , and self-esteem (Cassidy, O'Connor, Howe, & Warden, 2004) . However, no gender differences have emerged linking perceptions of ethnic discrimination and depressive symptoms (Brody et al., 2006; Delgado et al., 2011) . In longitudinal work, Greene and colleagues (2006) found no gender differences linking perceived ethnic discrimination and both self-esteem and depressive symptoms. However, it should be noted that Greene and colleagues did not explore the role of gender within specific ethnic groups. Specific to Latino male adolescents, some scholars have posited that they might perceive more ethnic discrimination than do female adolescents because of the socialization of traditional gender roles in Latino families (Alfaro et al., 2009) . That is, Latino parents might focus on socializing their adolescent female adolescents regarding the importance of the family environment and the home setting, while male adolescents may be socialized more toward taking a larger role in activities outside of the family. In turn, male adolescents have greater opportunities to perceive ethnic discrimination and might be more impacted by such encounters because of the importance of the extrafamilial context in shaping their development (Bulcroft, Carmody, & Bulcroft, 1996; Delgado et al., 2011) . However, it could also be that the more frequent exposure to these experiences actually desensitizes male adolescents, making the influence of perceived ethnic discrimination less impactful.",

Next, time-invariant predictors (i.e., gender, perceived discrimination) were included in the model to test whether each of these explained significant variability in initial starting values and/or rate of change in the outcome variable (i.e., self-esteem, depressive symptoms). Finally, the interaction between gender and perceived ethnic discrimination was added to the model to test whether the relation between perceived ethnic discrimination and trajectories of self-esteem, and between perceived ethnic discrimination and trajectories of depressive symptoms, varied as a function of adolescent gender. In all analyses, cohort (either ninth or 10th grade at T1) and adolescent nativity (U.S.-or foreign-born) were included as control variables.",

High levels of perceived ethnic discrimination were associated with lower self-esteem and higher depressive symptoms across each time point for male adolescents, but only related to higher depressive symptoms at T2 and T4 for female adolescents. Table 3 presents latent growth model results for self-esteem trajectory analyses. First, an unconditional growth model was estimated to examine adolescents' trajectories of self-esteem across four waves of data. Specifically, a two-factor growth model was estimated in which the paths from each observed indicator to the latent intercept were set equal to 1, and linear change (i.e., slope) was estimated by setting the paths equal to \u03ea1, 0, 1, and 2, resulting in time being centered at T2. We centered at T2 because the earliest wave at which data were available for one of the predictors (i.e., perceived ethnic discrimination) was T2. Centering at different time points changes the intercept coefficient but does not change the meaning or significance of slope coefficients. The unconditional growth model revealed that adolescents' self-esteem increased significantly from T1 to T4 (see Model 1, Table 3 ). Significant variability emerged in both the intercept and the slope, suggesting that there was significant individual variability in initial starting values (i.e., self-esteem at T2) and in adolescents' rate of growth in self-esteem. Because previous work suggests that growth in self-esteem is sometimes nonlinear (Baldwin & Hoffmann, 2002) , a quadratic growth term was entered in the model. The term was not significant, and its inclusion did not result in a better fitting model; thus, we proceeded with the linear model. Next, we examined whether trajectories of self-esteem varied as a function of adolescent gender (see Model 2, Table 3 ). Gender was a significant predictor of the intercept but not the slope, suggesting that male adolescents reported significantly higher self-esteem than did female adolescents at T2, but male adolescents and female adolescents did not differ in their rate of growth over time. Next, perceived ethnic discrimination was added to the model to test whether perceived ethnic discrimination at T2 significantly predicted adolescents' rate of growth in self-esteem (Model 3). Results revealed that perceived ethnic discrimination was a significant predictor of the intercept and slope; that is, individuals who reported greater levels of perceived ethnic discrimination reported lower levels of self-esteem at T2 and a significantly slower rate of growth in self-esteem across time (see Figure 1) . Finally, the interaction between gender and perceived ethnic discrimination was added to the growth model (Model 4). Results revealed a significant interaction on the self-esteem intercept, but not the slope. Using procedures outlined by Aiken and West (1991) for probing interactions, findings revealed that higher perceived ethnic discrimination at T2 was significantly associated with lower selfesteem at T2, but only for male adolescents.",

Self-esteem and depressive symptoms are important indicators of well-being during adolescence and have been associated with important indices of youth adjustment such as substance abuse (e.g., Miyamoto et al., 2001 ) and academic challenges (e.g., Carranza, You, Chhuon, & Hudley, 2009) ; furthermore, they serve as important predictors of subsequent outcomes in early adulthood (Boden et al., 2008; Fergusson et al., 2007) . The field's understanding of how youths' self-esteem and depressive symptoms change over the course of adolescence, however, is based largely on work with European American samples (e.g., Baldwin & Hoffman, 2002; Scheier et al., 2000) , limiting our understanding of how these critical indices of adjustment unfold for Latino adolescents. Our findings paint a promising picture of Latino youth adjustment and emphasize the importance of examining changes in psychological functioning during this developmental time. First, Latino adolescents in our study demonstrated a steady increase in self-esteem across the high school years. This finding is consistent with developmental theories (e.g., Elliot & Feldman, 1990 ) that suggest that individuals acquire a more developed self-concept from the period of middle to late adolescence. Also consistent with prior work (e.g., Kling et al., 1999) , male adolescents in our study reported significantly higher self-esteem than did female adolescents at each developmental period. Such differences are theorized to be partially due to societal attitudes and influences on adolescents' gender role development (Galambos, 2004) . That is, male adolescents are socialized to adhere to more traditional masculine behaviors or traits (e.g., competition, independence), and such traits are more strongly tied to self-esteem than are feminine traits (e.g., Orlofsky & O'Heron, 1987) .",

For female adolescents, however, our findings run counter to prior work, which has generally found increases in female adolescents' depressive symptoms across the high school years (e.g., Garber et al., 2002; Ge et al., 2001 ). It should be noted that although female adolescents' initial levels of depressive symptoms were significantly greater than were male adolescents, female adolescents' symptom levels were still low (M \u03ed .85), corresponding with the response option of \"some or a little of the time,\" and importantly, this mean was comparable to or lower than mean levels of symptoms reported in prior work with multiethnic samples of female adolescents (e.g., Meadows, Brown, & Elder, 2006; Roberts, Andrews, Lewinshon, & Hops, 1990) .

Thus, one possibility is that the pattern of decreases in symptomatology evidenced in the current study could be unique to the experience of Latina adolescents. It will be important for future work to examine whether this pattern is replicated in larger, more representative samples of Latino youths. Taken together, these findings suggest that the normative developmental trajectories of Latino youths' psychosocial functioning are characterized by patterns of increased adjustment throughout middle and late adolescence. Latino adolescents are oftentimes developing within environmental contexts in which they are a numerical ethnic minority, and such contexts are often characterized as more difficult and stressful environments for development; yet our study provides evidence that despite these potential environmental constraints, youths are progressing through high school, demonstrating increases in self-esteem and relatively low levels of depressive symptomatology. Such findings come at a time when much emphasis has been placed on the underachievement and risk status of Latino youths, often highlighting negative aspects of development, including higher dropout rates (Fry, 2008) , poor academic functioning (Arellano & Padilla, 1996) , and high depression rates, especially among female adolescents (Joiner, Perez, Wagner, Berenson, & Marquina, 2001 ). To clarify, we are not arguing that Latino youths are not disproportionately at greater risk for negative outcomes; however, we do argue that our findings suggest that the normative pattern of development for Latino youths is not characterized by maladjustment. Our findings point to a resilient group, able to overcome and adapt to the many difficulties experienced during adolescence.",

The current study took an important step in understanding how perceptions of ethnic discrimination were associated with trajectories of self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Findings indicated that perceived ethnic discrimination was concurrently associated with self-esteem and depressive symptoms in theoretically expected ways and that higher initial levels of perceived ethnic discrimination predicted slower increases in self-esteem over time, while lower initial levels of perceived ethnic discrimination predicted relatively faster growth in self-esteem over the high school years. Together, these findings suggest that perceptions of ethnic discrimination place individuals at a disadvantage early in high school, and for selfesteem, specifically, perceived discrimination has the potential of changing individuals' growth patterns, making it less likely that they will increase in self-esteem across the high school years. From a prevention perspective, these are important findings because it could be that lessening the impact of perceived discrimination in early high school has implications for adolescents' psychological functioning over time. It should be noted, however, that functioning prior to high school was not assessed. Therefore, it is unclear whether changes to their trajectories prior to this time occurred. Even so, prevention efforts focused on providing early and later adolescents with coping resources and/or fostering a strong ethnic identity and maintaining cultural beliefs (e.g., familism), all of which have been found to protect individuals from the impact of discriminatory experiences (e.g., Germ\u00e1n, Gonzales, Dumka, & Millsap, 2009; Uma\u00f1a-Taylor et al., 2011; Wong, Eccles, & Sameroff, 2003) , should be considered. Turning to variability by gender, although perceived ethnic discrimination emerged as an important predictor for both male adolescents' and female adolescents' depressive symptoms, it emerged as a stronger predictor of initial levels of self-esteem only among male adolescents. Male adolescents who reported lower levels of perceived ethnic discrimination tended to report significantly higher levels of self-esteem at T2, relative to their male counterparts who reported higher levels of perceived ethnic discrimination. Gender differences in the effect of perceived ethnic discrimination on self-esteem growth were not observed, suggesting that perceived ethnic discrimination has lasting effects across male adolescents and female adolescents. These findings, along with prior work (e.g., Cassidy et al., 2004) , suggest that Latino male adolescents' self-esteem may be relatively more vulnerable to perceptions of ethnic discrimination during early adolescence.

As a result, male adolescents' developing self-concept and identity might be more strongly based on their experiences in these domains. Because perceived ethnic discrimination is experienced largely in contexts outside of the family, its impact might be particularly strong among male adolescents, whose identities are relatively more tied to these extrafamilial contexts. Given that Latina female adolescents are encouraged to spend more time in the home relative to their male counterparts (Bulcroft et al., 1996) , their identity may rely more on features of the intrafamilial context; furthermore, additional time with family might serve as a protective factor against perceived ethnic discrimination. In contrast, the association between perceived ethnic discrimination and depressive symptoms did not differ by gender in the current study, which is consistent with prior work (Brody et al., 2006; Delgado et al., 2011) . Perhaps male adolescents' and female adolescents' depressive symptoms are equally affected by perceived discrimination because depressive symptoms reflect a state focused on feelings of loneliness and sadness and have less to do with self-definition or feelings of oneself (Sedikides & Gregg, 2003) . Regardless of the importance of the context in which perceived ethnic discrimination occurred, both male adolescents and female adolescents exhibit similar depressive feelings when these experiences are encountered. This explanation is speculative; future work focusing on cognitive processes involved in individuals' perceptions of ethnic discrimination and the role of gender socialization could help to uncover such complex relations. It also will be important for future work to conduct a more nuanced examination of how gender is informing the processes of interest. For example, rather than examining moderation by gender classification (i.e., male/female), it would be beneficial to examine whether gender role attitudes or socialization experiences are what moderate the associations examined in the current study.",

From a theoretical perspective, our findings aligned with Garc\u00eda Coll et al.'s (1996) integrative model of minority development by affirming that constructs relevant to racial and ethnic minority youths, such as perceived discrimination, contribute to variance in developmental processes (Garc\u00eda Coll et al., 1996) . Further, our study suggests that there are individual characteristics and particular areas of adjustment that are especially prone to perceptions of discrimination. That is, male adolescents' self-esteem in early adolescence appeared especially vulnerable to perceptions of ethnic discrimination. With scholars' recent interest in the specificity of linking stressors to psychosocial adjustment (McMahon, Grant, Compas, Thurm, & Ey, 2003) , these findings provide some evidence that there might be some specificity in the effects of perceived ethnic discrimination. With replication, these findings have the potential of contributing to ongoing theory interested in specifying pathways underlying the effects of perceived discrimination.",

First, our study relied on a diverse Latino population comprising individuals from many different national origin backgrounds (e.g., Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican), generational statuses, and nativity statuses. Analyses were run to examine whether national origin (classifying adolescents as either Mexican origin or other), generational status (combination of parent and adolescent U.S. nativity), or adolescent nativity status (foreign-born vs. U.S.-born) moderated the link between perceived ethnic discrimination and adolescent adjustment; no significant moderation emerged. However, we had a limited number of individuals representing each origin subgroup, which limited us in our ability to test the impact of perceived discrimination on developmental trajectories among each national origin group. Further, differences in nativity and generational status by ethnic origin could not be explored. Examining variability by national origin group while taking into account individuals' place of birth and generational status will be important for future work, given that prior work has identified differences in indices of psychological functioning (Portes & Zady, 2002; Supple & Plunkett, 2011) and differences in perceptions of discrimination (P\u00e9rez, Fortuna, & Alegr\u00eda, 2008) among Latino origin subgroups.",

Prior work has demonstrated that Latinos born in the United States differ from foreign-born individuals on psychological functioning (Gavin et al., 2010) and perceptions of discrimination (P\u00e9rez et al., 2008) . From a theoretical perspective, individuals who are more recent immigrants to the United States might carry a dual frame of reference, in which they tend to view experiences in their new surroundings as generally positive because they are evaluating their current situation based on the oftentimes deleterious contexts from which they immigrated (Portes, 1999; Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 2001 ). Thus, despite potentially experiencing greater discrimination than U.S.-born youths do, such experiences might have less of an impact on foreign-born youths, given their optimism about being in the United States. Although the current study examined potential moderation by nativity, limited variability in nativity status may have impeded our ability to detect moderation. Thus, studies with samples that have large enough subsamples are needed to examine the unique impact of discriminatory experiences on both U.S.-and foreign-born Latinos' psychological functioning trajectories.",

It is possible that findings did not emerge for depressive symptoms due to the restricted range in the span of development examined (i.e., only two points of data were available for depressive symptoms after the initial assessment of perceived discrimination at Wave 2). Further, for both self-esteem and depressive symptoms, perceived discrimination was treated as a time invariant construct, constant across the high school years. Similar to psychosocial adjustment, prior literature suggests that perceptions of discrimination change across development (Greene et al., 2006) .
