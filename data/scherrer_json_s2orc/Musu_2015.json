Using growth mixture modelling, we examined trajectories of change for 421 students from 4th grade through college in their self-concept of ability (SCA) in math, interest in math, and perceived importance of math. We also assessed how these trajectories relate to choice of college major, focusing on math-intensive and non-intensive majors. Gender, parental income, and initial achievement were included as covariates in the analyses. A 3-class solution best represented underlying trajectories of change for each of the 3 constructs. A latent class relatively high in math self-concept, interest, and importance emerged for each construct respectively, and individuals in these high classes were most likely to choose a math-intensive college major. Interpretations and implications of the trajectories of change and their influence on college major classification are discussed.",

Research based in expectancy-value theory has established that students' domain-specific self-concepts of their ability (SCA), expectancies for success, and achievement task values are related to achievement outcomes in those domains, such as classroom grades (Meece, Wigfield, & Eccles, 1990) , and choices, such as the number and type of courses students choose to take in that subject area in high school and college (Eccles, Vida, & Barber, 2004; Nagy, Trautwein, Baumert, K\u00f6ller, & Garrett, 2006; Watt, 2006) . In the math domain, studies have found that SCA, interest, and perceived importance of math (aspects of task values, see below) measured in elementary school predict how many math courses students elect to take in high school (Simpkins, Davis-Kean, & Eccles, 2006) . Students' self-concept of their ability in math and their value for math measured in high school also predicts their plans to pursue a math-intensive career or course of study in college (Nagy et al., 2006; Watt, 2006) . These studies establish that individuals' SCA and values in math can be used to predict future choices. The present study builds on this work by looking at longterm prediction of activity choice; that is, how students' math SCA and values measured in elementary and high school predict their ultimate choice of a college major.",

The general pattern of change in beliefs, values, and intrinsic motivation is one of decline (Jacobs et al., 2002 ; see Wigfield et al., in press , for a review); however, several studies have found that the trajectory of motivational changes differs across students (Archambault et al., 2010; Gottfried, Marcoulides, Gottfried, Oliver, & Guerin, 2007; Marcoulides, Gottfried, Gottfried, & Oliver, 2008) .",

Such work would provide an important advance in the literature, as choice likely is based more on how beliefs and values change rather than on their level at one time point. In the present study, we focused on the math-\"intensiveness\" of students' college major choices. Examining students' choice in this area is particularly important given that math-intensive degrees are associated with higher prestige careers (Ma & Johnson, 2008) and national needs for math and science professionals are currently not being met (National Science Board, 2012) . Understanding the long-term trajectories of changes in motivational constructs in expectancy-value theory may provide insight into the likelihood of students selecting a certain college major.",

Individuals' SCA is their belief about how good they are at activities in a given domain; thus, Eccles and colleagues focus on the \"Me\" or objective part of the self (see also Harter, 2006) . Domain specificity is an important component of the theory, and the work in this area generally examines students' beliefs in a particular domain; math in the current study. Eccles and Wigfield (1995) found that expectancies and self-concept ability are strongly related empirically (see Wigfield, Tonks, & Klauda, 2009 , for a detailed review of this work). In the present study, we examined SCA for math rather than expectancies for success in math because many of the studies in this theoretical tradition that have looked at relations of beliefs to outcomes examined SCA in a particular domain rather than expectancies for success in that domain (Durik, Vida, & Eccles, 2006; Nagy et al., 2006; Simpkins et al., 2006) .",

Interest task value, as its name implies, is how much the individual likes or enjoys the task; attainment value is how important it is to the individual to do well on the task, and utility value is how useful it is to him or her.

(1990) found that middle school students' math ability beliefs directly predicted their later math performance but not their intentions to continue taking math. In contrast, the importance students gave to math directly predicted their intentions but not their performance. With respect to career choices, Durik et al. (2006) found that students' SCA, interest, and perceived importance of literacy measured in 4th grade related positively to these same variables measured in 10th grade. Children's SCA and ratings of importance in turn predicted students' increased likelihood of desiring a career where reading comprehension would be important, such as becoming a lawyer or editor (the relations between reading importance and career likelihood were especially strong). Interest did not relate to the career variables. Simpkins et al. (2006) found that students' SCA, interest in, and perceived importance of math in 6th grade was related to levels of the same constructs in 10th grade. However, they found that students' SCA and interest in math measured in 10th grade predicted their decisions to take more challenging math courses in 11th and 12th grade, but math importance did not. Eccles et al. (2004) found that plans to attend college measured in sixth grade and selfconcept of academic ability in sixth grade predicted the decision to go to college. However, these relations were mediated by high school course selection such that those students who planned to attend college in sixth grade took \"college prep\" courses in high school and high school course taking then predicted students' choice to enrol in college. Eccles et al.'s results indicate that decisions about college likely begin long before the college transition, as early as sixth grade. Given that previous work shows that students' domain-specific Educational Research and Evaluation SCA, interest, and importance differentially predict achievement outcomes and choices in those domains, it is essential to understand the unique influence each of these variables may have on students' academic choices. Additionally, we added the important new dimension of examining how change in each of the SCA and value for math variables related to college major choice.",

The declines are especially pronounced in the math domain (Gottfried, Fleming, & Gottfried, 2001; Jacobs et al., 2002; Spinath & Spinath, 2005) . However, Gottfried et al. (2007) and Marcoulides et al.

These latter two studies indicate that there are perhaps different underlying classes or trajectories of change in regard to students' motivation.

They identified seven underlying classes representing different trajectories of change in self-concept and task value for literacy over time. The trajectories for all the classes showed a decline in both variables over time, with the exception of what they called the \"Low Trajectory\". This group (2.5% of the sample) declined through middle school but then increased through high school, returning to their original levels. The declines varied in the steepness of their slopes. For the \"declining\" classes, the slopes of the decline varied. For instance, students in one trajectory (called the High Trajectory) began with high literacy SCA and values and declined only slightly. Another started declining steeply and quite early in elementary school, with some recovery during the high school years. The present study is the first to examine such trajectories in math, and we will compare our findings to Archambault and colleagues' findings.",

The finding for gender is not surprising given that the study was done in the literacy domain. In addition, several studies have found that gender is an important moderator variable in the relations of adolescents' self-concepts of ability and values to their mathematics aspirations (Eccles, Barber, & Jozefowicz, 1999; Frome, Alfeld, Eccles, & Barber, 2006; Nagy et al., 2006; Watt, 2006) . These studies show that for girls only those with high self-concepts of ability and value have high aspirations in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); boys with moderate beliefs and values can have such aspirations. Finally, Archambault et al. also found that latent classes that showed steeper declines in SCA and task value were more likely to be associated with low household income. Given these findings, in the present study gender, achievement, and parent income were included as covariates in the analyses.",

For this and other reasons, we decided to examine the relations of the trajectory of these variables to choice of college major separately rather than together, for several reasons. First, given that this is the first study to examine such relations we were interested in how the trajectory in each variable related individually to college major choice. Second, other studies of relations of beliefs and college major choice have examined these relations with individual rather than multiple predictor variables (e.g., Allen & Robbins, 2008) . Third, researchers such as Trautwein et al. (2012), who used a complex modelling procedure to examine links of SCA and values to grades, looked at the predictive relations separately for each aspect of task value rather than in combination. Given these precedents and the complexity of the modelling analyses in this study, we looked at the trajectory of each of the belief and value variables and how each relates to college major choice.",

Childhood and Beyond started in the mid-1980s, and data were collected from 12 schools in three different school districts in southeast Michigan. Data from three cohorts of students were collected, and the first wave of data collection occurred when students were in kindergarten, first, and third grade. Students and their parents were surveyed in elementary school and sent followup surveys in high school. Participants completed the measures each year from 1987 to 1990. There was a 3-year gap in data collection due to funding issues. Data collection resumed in 1994 through 1999. The oldest cohort was sent a questionnaire during their 2nd year in college.",

This scale has been adapted and used reliably in other studies classifying students into categories based on a math-intensive major (e.g., Pajares & Miller, 1995) . The adapted measure classified majors into four groups based on how much math was required: Little to no math, some math, moderate math, and intensive math. Math requirements were assessed by determining the average number of math courses required by a particular major. The majors placed in each category are displayed in Table 5 . Only a very small number of majors were not included in Goldman and Hewitt's (1976) initial taxonomy. Those that were not were examined to see whether similar majors existed. For example, \"nurse practitioner\" was not included in the Goldman and Hewitt scale, but pre-nursing was. Due to the similarity of these two majors, they were both assigned the same code. Additionally, few changes were required to adapt the measure from classifying STEM-related majors to math-intensive majors. Some majors were more math intensive than in the original scale. For example, in the adapted scale used for this study, finance majors were coded as a 4 due to the math-intensive nature of this course of study; however, they were classified as a 3 in the original Goldman and Hewitt scale.",

Results indicated that linear change over time fit best for growth in selfconcept of ability, but quadratic change more appropriately represented the change over time in interest and importance as the growth rate in each construct showed a proclivity to diminish at later times. Comparisons across models were based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) fit statistics, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the comparative fit index (CFI) to get a sense of overall model fit; these are recommended fit statistics for this type of analysis (Nylund, Asparouhov, & Muth\u00e9n, 2007) .

These covariates were achievement, gender, and parent income; covariates were chosen for several reasons, as discussed earlier. First, students' level of achievement in an area likely affects whether they choose to major in it in college. In this study, we were interested in motivation, so it was important to examine initial achievement. Similarly, studies show that girls often have lower self-concepts of ability in math than do boys (even if they perform similarly or better than boys) (US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2009; Watt, 2006; Wigfield et al., 1997) , and so we wanted to examine these possible differences. Parent income is related to trajectories of change (Archambault et al., 2010) and might also relate to choice of college major, and so we wanted to examine this variable as well. Figure 1 shows the conceptual model for the full set of analyses. The slope (\u03b1), intercept (\u03b2 1 ), and, when necessary, the quadratic term (\u03b2 2 ) were used to represent growth across Educational Research and Evaluation measurement occasions. We allowed gender, initial math performance, and parent income to influence class membership and also examined the effect of these covariates on initial levels of self-concept, interest, and importance as well as the linear growth parameter within classes. Finally, class membership was used to predict college major category. Once a final model was selected for each construct, college major was entered in the model as an ordinal outcome. For ordinal outcomes, Mplus gives threshold values that can be converted to probabilities in order to examine whether classification trends differ across latent classes (B. Muth\u00e9n, 2004) using the following equation, where u i represents the college major category:",

Further, a quadratic model with a heterogeneous covariance structure showed the best overall model fit (BIC = 6543.50, RMSEA = 0.059, CFI = 0.948). Moving forward with this information, the number of underlying latent classes was then explored in Step 2 of the analyses. We again tested models with up to seven different classes and found a three-, four-, or five-class solution showed similar levels of data model fit. Ultimately, when constraints were released within individuals and between individuals, classification got worse and the separation of the classes was not as clear. Further, the three-class solution showed the best and most interpretable separation of classes. Therefore, the fully constrained three-class model was selected due to the better and more interpretable classifications and separation of classes. The final three-class solution is shown in Figure 3 after both covariates and college major were entered in the model. Class 1 contained approximately 40% of the sample and is shown as a solid line. This class represents those students who show relatively high interest in math over time and was therefore labelled the High Interest Trajectory. These students start with the highest reported levels of interest in math (m a1 = 4.50), which decline somewhat over time, especially throughout the middle years (m b 11 = -0.42) but show an increase in interest in late high school into college as indicated by the positive quadratic term (m b 21 = 0.03) and shown as a u-shaped change. Class 2 contained approximately 22% of the sample and is shown as a dotted line. Students in this class began with moderate levels of interest in math in elementary school (m a2 = 3.38) and show a decline in their reported interest over time (m b 12 = -0.40), although this decline follows a somewhat curvilinear trend (m b 22 = 0.02) and evens out in high school and into college. Thus, we chose to label this class the Slow Decline Interest Trajectory. Students in Class 3, 38% of the sample represented as a dashed line, report initially high levels of interest in math (m a3 = 4.52), which declines rather steeply over time (m b 13 = -0.71) but also levels out at the end of high school and into college (m b 23 = 0.04). We labelled this class the Fast Decline Interest Trajectory. Table 7 shows the probability of choice of each major category across the three classes. Similar to the High Self-Concept Trajectory, the High Interest Trajectory begins with high interest in math, and although they decline slightly through the middle years, their interest in math goes up again in late high school and early college. Students in this trajectory have a 34% chance of being classified in the intensive math major category. In contrast, students in the Slow Decline Interest Trajectory and the Fast Decline Interest Trajectory have a 15% and a 0% chance of being classified in the intensive math major category, respectively. Similar to the results for self-concept of ability, there were no significant differences in gender distribution, household income, and initial math achievement across the classes. Further, these covariates were not significant predictors of the initial intercept or slope within the classes. For the High Interest Trajectory, the mean income was 5, the mean fourth-grade achievement was 10.6, and the gender distribution was .43, indicating this class contained a slightly higher proportion of females. The mean income for the Slow Decline Interest Trajectory was 5.2, the mean achievement was 9.6, and the gender distribution was .48.

Building on longitudinal studies that have shown that SCA and values in math measured at one time point predict choice of math courses in high school (Updegraff et al., 1996; Watt, 2006) , we found that trajectories of change predicted choice of a college major. Results of this study also extend prior research that shows students' confidence and interest in a subject when they are in college are associated with students' choice of a major in that domain (Eccles, 2007; Harackiewicz et al., 2002; Larson et al., 2010) by showing that different trajectories of change over time are differentially associated with individuals' choice of a math-intensive major. Further, our results are consistent with Li and colleagues (2009) , who found that interest in math and science in middle school can have long-term impact on choice of a college major; we found that individuals in the high trajectories, or the classes who maintained the most positive ability beliefs and values, were the most likely to select a math-intensive major in college. While it is clear from the literature that proximal motivations influence student choice (e.g., Larson et al., 2010; Meece et al., 1990) , students' motivations are a result of a rich history of experiences in and attitudes toward a domain that produces different motivational trajectories. We believe the most important theoretical contribution of this study is tying together two major strands of Eccles and colleagues' (e.g., Eccles-Parsons et al., 1983; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992 ) research based in their expectancy-value model. One strand concerns how children's SCA and values change over time. The other is how these variables relate to performance and choice. This study is the first to look at these two aspects together; that is, how change predicts choice. We next consider the trajectories of change and then comment on their links to choice.",

There was a fast-declining trajectory for each variable, with the groups having this trajectory ending up with the lowest SCA, interest, and importance in math. For SCA and interest, the third trajectory was one of slow decline; for importance, the Low Steady Trajectory had similar low ratings of math importance from 4th through 12th grade.

Their study did not look at importance or SCA, so we are unable to make comparisons regarding the number of classes for these constructs. Marcoulides et al.'s sample included 9-through 17-year-olds. They found greater variability in students' intrinsic motivation early on (before age 13) and (as just noted) strong stability after that. One implication from both these studies' results is that interventions to improve students' interest in math will be more likely to be successful if started earlier in the school years.",

(1997) in their examination of this sample as a whole, we found that the nature of these declines differs both within and across the measured variables in our study. One possible explanation for these different patterns could be that students who maintained higher achievement in math were more likely to have higher ability beliefs and, to a lesser extent, values for math. Although initial achievement did not discriminate among the classes for any of the variables, it is possible that later achievement did influence the pattern of change. Many students' grades in math decrease over time ; thus, the linear decline in students' math SCA could reflect such changes in grades, as well as the students becoming more accurate in their perceptions of ability as they got older (Nicholls, 1979 ; see Wigfield, Eccles, Schiefele, Roeser, & Davis-Kean, 2006 , for a review).",

Further, Eccles and Midgley (1989) and others (e.g., Wigfield, Byrnes, & Eccles, 2006) discussed how changes in school and classroom environments can produce changes in students' SCA and values. Given the different trajectories, we found our results suggest that changes in classroom environments over time may differentially impact different children.",

Frenzel et al. (2010) also found in their study of German fifththrough ninth-grade students that those coming from families who valued math maintained their own interest in math. Thus, parents can impact their children's beliefs and values in math. However, in secondary school many classrooms become more competitive, focused on performance, and less warm as students get older; this is particularly likely in math . Such changes in classroom environments likely impact students' valuing of math in particular, leading them to lose interest in it and deem it less important for them, as shown in several of the trajectories for interest and importance. Archambault et al. (2010) , also using the CAB data, identified seven trajectories of change in literacy SCA and values rather than the three we identified. One reason for this difference in the number of trajectories identified could be that the sample in Archambault et al. was larger than ours because they did not limit their sample to the college cohort. Despite the differing number of classes identified, a similarity in the results of both studies is that the general pattern of change in the groups identified was one of decline. Even those students with the most positive ability beliefs and values showed declines over time in these variables. Changes in the accuracy of students' beliefs, changes in classroom environments, and parental support are the most likely explanations for these findings, as noted above. The effects of such changes on students' choice of college major appear to be least pronounced for the students in the highest classes for each construct; these students' ability beliefs and values decline to a degree, but they choose math-intensive majors. The students in the more consistently declining classes, whether this decline is slow or fast, are much more likely to pursue non-math-related majors.",

Prior research has shown that ability beliefs and values independently predict students' choices (Durik et al., 2006; Meece et al., 1990; Simpkins et al., 2006) and also that they may not relate that strongly over time (Spinath & Steinmayr, 2008) , so these findings could explain why the trajectories are not the same for all constructs. SCA, interest, and importance appear to follow unique trajectories of change over time. One possible explanation for these differences is that there are different influences on these variables. As noted above, students' SCA relate more closely than their values to their grades (Meece et al., 1990) , so perhaps the linear change in SCA in each trajectory reflected decreases in students' grades, with stronger declines occurring for students whose grades decline more. Students' achievement values also relate to grades but somewhat less strongly (Meece et al., 1990) . Values also depend upon how an activity relates to students' feelings about the activity and sense that it is important to the self or not, as well as on the classroom environment influences discussed earlier. These multiple influences on value may explain why the pattern of change in its components was different than the linear changes observed in SCA. Future research should examine more closely what factors impact change in students' value of math.",

Although we examined several covariates in an attempt to understand why particular students may have ended up in a particular class, we found no evidence for significant differences in the gender composition, parental income, and initial achievement across the classes. This is inconsistent with prior research that has found gender differences in SCA and intrinsic value of math as well as work showing that gender related to trajectories of change (Archambault et al., 2010; Nagy et al., 2006; Watt, 2006) . Thus, additional variables that could help explain why particular students ended up in a particular class should be explored in future research. Both Nagy et al. (2006) and Watt (2006) had non-US student samples. Therefore, it could be that cultural differences account for the gender differences observed in those studies. While Archambault et al. (2010) had a US sample, they concentrated on the literacy domain. Thus, gender differences in their study tended to show females classified into more adaptive trajectories as compared to males; reflecting the stereotype that literacy activities are more appropriate for females. Our results showing no impact of gender on the trajectories may reflect changes in stereotypes about the appropriateness of math activities for females. Recent research has found that the gender gap in mathematics achievement is declining (US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2009) , and our results may reflect these changing patterns of students' achievement as well as their beliefs.",

Our results indicate that the different trajectories in children's beliefs, interest, and values all had substantial impact on their choice of college major. Students in the High SCA trajectory were 95% likely to be in a major that required either an intensive or moderate amount of math. By contrast, very few students showing slow or fast declines in math SCA chose majors requiring intensive amounts of math. Similar patterns occurred for both math interest and importance, although it should be noted that students showing slow declines in interest or importance were more likely to be in majors requiring math than were those who were in the declining SCA trajectories; these findings may reflect earlier work showing that values are a stronger predictor of choice than is SCA (Meece et al., 1990 ).",

This fact, coupled with the long-term relations of SCA and values to choice, suggests that the kinds of beliefs and values students have about math (and likely other subject areas) in late elementary school have long-term implications for their later academic choices. Thus, interventions to change the trajectories of students whose beliefs and values decline should start early during the school years. Several recent studies have shown that interventions targeting students' motivation can be implemented at a low cost and with relative ease and still show positive effects (for a review see Yeager & Walton, 2011) . In particular, interventions targeting students' interest and value have been shown to positively affect their academic outcomes (Hulleman, Godes, Hendricks, & Harackiewicz, 2010; Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009) .",

The results thus provide an important validation and extension of Eccles-Parsons et al.'s (1983) expectancy-value model of achievement performance and choice. There are, however, some important limitations of this research that must be considered when interpreting the results. First, the study employed a correlational design, and so inferences about causality are only tentative despite the longitudinal design. Second, the sample for the current study was quite homogeneous. Although the sample was chosen specifically to limit external factors that might hinder students' opportunities for success, the results may not generalize well to other populations of students, especially those that may not have more obstacles in their path to a college education. Future research should be conducted using more diverse samples of students, especially considering whether similar latent classes emerge in these different samples.",

Classroom observations would be one way to study this issue, to see if different kinds of classroom practices produce increases or decreases in motivation for different students (see Archambault et al., 2010 , for a discussion of this issue in the literacy domain). Student ratings of classroom practices also could be a useful tool. Finally, parental attitudes towards math and how they involve themselves with their children's school experiences in math may also be an important predictor of change in students' math SCA and values (Frenzel et al., 2010) .",

Expectancy-value theory suggests that SCA and task values make unique, individual contributions to achievement choices and outcomes (Eccles-Parsons et al., 1983) . Further, as noted earlier, Spinath and Steinmayr (2008) found only weak evidence for cross-lagged influence over time between students' competence beliefs and intrinsic motivation. However, SCA, importance, and interest are not wholly independent of one another, and likely levels of one influences levels of the others over time. As such, while we believe it is first necessary to understand their unique trajectories of change over time in relation to outcomes and choices, future research should address how changes in the constructs in conjunction with one another may differentially impact individuals' choices.",

Additionally, in the US, attrition out of math-heavy majors is particularly high (Chen, 2013) .
