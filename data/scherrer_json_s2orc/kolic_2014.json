A secondary aim was also to test a model of the relationships among gender, attitudes toward reading, metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies, and reading comprehension. The sample for this longitudinal study consisted of 175 students. The first data collection took place when the students were enrolled in grade 4 (10 years old), and the follow-up measurements were conducted in grades 6 and 8. At each measurement point, measures of metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies and attitudes toward reading were applied in addition to text comprehension tasks. The obtained results indicated that metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies continuously improved during early adolescence, while attitudes toward recreational reading showed continuous decline from the fourth to the eighth grade, and attitudes toward academic reading dropped significantly between sixth and eighth grades. Girls consistently demonstrated better metacognitive knowledge, as well as more positive attitudes toward both recreational and academic reading when compared to boys. The model that included only attitudes toward recreational reading fitted the data better than the model comprising both academic and recreational reading attitudes. The findings of the path analysis indicated that gender had an effect on recreational reading attitudes that consistently predicted text comprehension directly and indirectly through metacognitive knowledge during early adolescence. The model fitted the data better as students got older.",

                "text": "Reading literacy is believed to be one of the key competencies for full participation in modern societies. In longitudinal studies in Australia, Canada and Switzerland, performance in reading on the PISA assessment at age 15 was a strong predictor of future educational attainment and success in the labour market (OECD, 2010a) . However, international surveys such as PIRLS and PISA continuously show that most children do not reach the highest levels of text comprehension (Mullis, Martin, Foy, & Drucker, 2012; OECD, 2010a) . These levels require constructively responsive reading (Pressley & Afflerbach, 1995) , which involves reading with a purpose and active construction of meaning from the text. This implies the reader's orchestration of a number of skills and strategies during reading. Metacognitive knowledge of the reading strategies is a prerequisite for successful monitoring and control of reading with the purpose of good text comprehension. The student needs to know reading strategies, and he/she must be willing to use them appropriately. The knowledge and use of various (meta)cognitive strategies help students to effectively learn from texts (Flavell, Miller, & Miller, 1993) . Metacognitive knowledge of strategies contributes to an awareness of the ways to attain a learning goal. The conscious use of these strategies during reading helps the reader to recognise the relevant information in a text and to activate relevant background knowledge, as well as to monitor and regulate learning strategies in order to enhance comprehension. Flavell (1979) recognised strategy knowledge, which is knowledge about the types of strategies likely to be most useful in the cognitive task. It represents an aspect of metacognitive knowledge, along with person knowledge and task knowledge. The same components are recognised in reading (Baker & Brown, 1984; Paris, Lipson, & Wixson, 1983) . Metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies refers to the declarative, procedural and conditional knowledge of strategies: i.e., what reading strategies are, how they should be used, and when they can be used (Pressley, 2002) . Reading strategies include a broad variety of specific behaviours, which can be classified based on their goals (e.g., to activate or use prior knowledge, to infer information not explicitly stated in text, to identify the main idea of a text, to process a text additionally after reading it; see Pressley, 1995) and based on the phases of reading (strategies used before reading, during reading and after reading; see Paris, Wasik, & Turner, 1991) . There are many strategies that can be applied during reading, but some strategies have been validated in several research studies (Pressley, 1995) , such as text summarisation, question generation and answer explanation, student-generated elaborations, and organising strategies. These strategies promote active processing of text information and comprehension monitoring. Willson and Rupley (1997) found that strategy knowledge of how to read text and what to read in text begins to dominate the prediction of reading comprehension for both narrative and expository text during secondary school. Kuhn (2000) characterised the development of metacognition as the very gradual progress of acquiring better cognitive strategies to replace inefficient ones. The literature on metacognitive development in reading suggests that metacognitive knowledge about reading develops first, and control and regulation of reading develop later (Paris et al., 1991) . Children learn a lot about reading before they start schooling, through their exposure to print and through reading with their parents. Reading awareness continues to develop past the age of seven. Myers and Paris (1978) have examined the metacognitive knowledge of children between 8 and 12 years old and found that older children knew more about text structure, various reading goals and reading strategies than younger children. Pazzaglia, De Beni, and Caccio (1999) reported that metacognitive knowledge of strategies continuously improved from the age of eight to the age of twelve. During secondary education, metacognitive knowledge of the nature of reading becomes more refined, but even 12-year-olds have neither a well-defined knowledge about reading nor effective strategies that enhance reading comprehension.",

Their results showed a significant grade effect on metacognitive knowledge at the upper elementary school level, after the age of 10. In a recent study (Koli\u0107-Vehovec, Pe\u010djak, Ajdi\u0161ek, & Ron\u010devi\u0107, 2008; Pe\u010djak, Koli\u0107-Vehovec, Ron\u010devi\u0107, & Ajdi\u0161ek, 2009) , the age differences in metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies and reading motivation were examined in samples of fourth and eighth grade students from Croatia and Slovenia. In both samples, eighth graders showed greater metacognitive knowledge than fourth graders. Moreover, metacognitive knowledge of reading strategy use was consistently related to reading comprehension scores in both age groups and in both samples. Metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies continues to develop in high school, as O' Reilly and McNamara (2007) found significant effects of grade level on metacognitive reading strategy knowledge in high-school samples (ninth grade to 12 th grade). Although age differences in metacognitive knowledge related to reading are well documented, most of those findings were obtained in crosssectional studies, and there is a need for further confirmation based on longitudinal data.",

                "text": "Motivation and affect are relevant for activating metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies with the aim of better comprehension. Although motivation for reading has been investigated widely, the affect related to reading is less explored. Fox and Alexander (2009) recommended greater consideration of the role of affective processes in reading. Affect can be in the form of attitudes and emotions (Efklides, 2011) . Attitudes represent how students feel about a task, but they also have a cognitive component (i.e., beliefs) and are reflected in behavioural dispositions toward the task. Alexander and Filler (1976) defined reading attitude as \"a system of feelings related to reading which causes the learner to approach or avoid a reading situation\" (p. 1). McKenna and Kear (1990) differentiate attitude toward recreational reading and attitude toward school-related, academic reading. It was documented that recreational reading has been related to positive reading attitudes (Guthrie & Alvermann, 1999) , which are linked to better achievement in reading (McKenna & Kear, 1990) . Reading amount and reading achievement are thought to be reciprocally related -as reading amount increases, reading achievement increases, which in turn increases reading amount (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1998) . In PISA study (OECD, 2002) , which explored the reading habits of 15-year-olds in 32 countries, it was found that those students who were high achievers in reading literacy were much more likely than low achievers to read for enjoyment. Similar results were obtained ten years later, in a 2009 PISA study (OECD, 2010b) There is some evidence that reading for pleasure at home and reading for school are predicted by different variables. For example, Cox and Guthrie (2001) found that motivation predicted reading for enjoyment over and above other variables, such as past reading achievement and cognitive strategy use. By contrast, motivation did not predict amount of school reading, which was predicted only by the use of cognitive strategies. The school context, with its emphasis on assignments and assessments, places particular demands on cognitive competence and strategy use. With reading for enjoyment, however, individual interests prevail, and reading amount is determined most strongly by motivation.",

The proposed model predicts that as children mature, more leisure options are available to them in addition to reading. Therefore, students' attitudes toward reading will become less positive because they may find other activities more appealing. Research has repeatedly shown that pupils' attitudes towards reading get worse with age. McKenna, Kear, and Ellsworth (1995) , on a large national stratified U.S sample of students from the first to the sixth grade, found that recreational and academic reading attitudes become gradually, but steadily, more negative throughout the elementary school years, beginning at a relatively positive point and ending at relative indifference.",

Kush and Watkins (1996) also found that girls consistently showed more positive attitudes toward recreational reading than boys at different grade levels in elementary and middle school. McKenna (1994) argues that the expectations of significant others play a formative role in the development of attitudes. If a child's environment encourages, models, and reinforces reading, more positive attitudes should result. Gender-specific beliefs concerning what others expect about reading may explain consistent findings that girls tend to possess more positive attitudes than boys.

Most of the proposed SRL models could also be applied to the self-regulation of reading. Initial models of SRL (Bandura, 1986; Zimmerman, 1986) emphasised cognitive and metacognitive processes in learning. More recently, the role of motivational and affective processes was recognised (Boekaerts, 1996; Efklides, 2011; Pintrich, 2000; Winne, 2004) . However, research on the relationship between metacognition and affect is still scarce. Efklides, in her Metacognitive and Affective Model of Self-regulated Learning (MASRL, 2011), explained how metacognition, motivation and affect interacted in SRL on a Person level, as well as on the Task-specific level, and on the Person x Task level, emphasising the mechanisms that connect top-down and bottom-up self-regulation. For the present research, top-down processes guided by the person metacognitive and affective characteristics are of interest. The person builds a framework of action through goal-setting and planning in the forethought phase of SRL, using metacognitive knowledge of task and strategies, and reflections on the past experiences, feelings and thoughts during task processing. It is also proposed that affect in the form of attitudes should be related to metacognitive knowledge of self, task and strategies because attitudes have cognitive and behavioural components in addition to affective components.",

Four years later, similar results were obtained (Roeschl-Heils et al., 2003) . Most of the relationships between the assessed variables were found to be stable over this period. In grades 3 and 4, there were no significant gender differences in any of the variables examined, and this was also true for grades 7 and 8, although there was a tendency for girls to outperform boys on most reading and metacognitive measures. However, the researchers did not apply the same measures at the two assessment points, so developmental changes could not be examined.",

The variables were assessed on three measurement points, in grades 4, 6, and 8. Based on previous findings (Koli\u0107-Vehovec et al., 2008 , 2009 Pazzaglia et al., 1999) , it was expected that metacognitive knowledge would grow during that developmental period. It was also expected that attitudes toward reading would become less positive during the same period, especially boys' attitudes toward recreational reading, as was previously observed (McKenna & al., 1995) . This study also aimed to test the proposed model of the relationships among gender, metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies, attitudes toward reading, and reading comprehension. Based on the MASRL model (Efklides, 2011) , it was hypothesised that attitudes toward reading directly, and indirectly through metacognitive knowledge, predict reading comprehension (see Figure 1 ). We also postulated that the effect of gender on reading comprehension would be mediated by reading attitudes and metacognitive knowledge. In Croatia, where gender disparities in the PISA reading assessment (2010b) were above the OECD average, enjoyment of reading and awareness of effective learning strategies explained approximately half of the overall gender differences in reading performance. It was expected that the model would fit the data better as students got older. ",

Attitudes toward recreational and academic reading, metacognitive knowledge and text comprehension had positive intercorrelations in sixth and eighth grades. In fourth grade, metacognitive knowledge was not related to attitudes toward reading. Metacognitive knowledge and text comprehension in fourth grade had moderate positive correlations with recreational reading attitudes, metacognitive knowledge, and text comprehension in the sixth and eighth grades. To investigate whether there are gender differences and developmental changes in attitudes toward reading and metacognitive knowledge about reading strategies during early adolescence, a series of two-way ANOVAs (Gender x Grade level) was performed. The results are shown in Table 2 . Reading attitudes dropped significantly for both recreational and academic scores during early adolescence. Post-hoc comparison indicated that there were significant declines in attitudes toward recreational reading from fourth to sixth grade and from sixth to eight grade. A significant decline in attitudes toward academic reading occurred from sixth to eight grade. At all three grade levels, girls had more positive attitudes toward both recreational and academic reading. Girls also had higher metacognitive knowledge about reading strategies at all three assessment points. In contrast to reading attitudes, metacognitive knowledge increased from one assessment point to the next one. There were no interactive effects of gender and grade level on reading attitudes and metacognitive knowledge. The effect sizes for grade effects were larger than those for gender effects.",

The finding that points to developmental changes in metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies aligns with the results of the majority of cross-sectional studies that have found significant grade effects in secondary grades (Koli\u0107-Vehovec & Baj\u0161anski, 2003; Koli\u0107-Vehovec et al., 2008; Paris et al., 1991; Pazzaglia et al., 1999) . Those results strongly support the claim that an important improvement in metacognitive knowledge of reading occurs at the secondary school level, after the age of 10. This improvement may be related to interactive effects of cognitive development during early adolescence and accumulated reading practice, allowing students to gain relevant knowledge about different actions that can improve text comprehension. Kuhn (2000) asserted that cognitive development implied more frequent use of appropriate strategies. Comprehension monitoring, which develops intensively during early adolescence (Pazzaglia et al., 1999) , leads to an enhanced metacognitive awareness of the reading goal and improves insight about the extent to which the goal is being met by different strategies. Furthermore, it enhances awareness and understanding of the reading strategies themselves. The selection of strategies that best serve various functions while reading different texts and the skilful application of suitable strategies results in better text comprehension.",

However, the effect size obtained in the present study was small, as was that in the O'Reilly and McNamara study (2007) . Because gender differences were more noticeable in some educational contexts then others, it seems that educational practice and expectation might be important for gender differences (OECD, 2010b). That assumption is also supported by the finding of Koli\u0107-Vehovec et al. (2009) that gender differences in metacognitive knowledge were not significant in Slovenian eighth graders in an urban area (although they were present among fourth graders), which might be due to continuous efforts of educational authorities to enhance reading practices among Slovenian students in early adolescence. In contrast to metacognitive knowledge, attitudes toward recreational reading showed continuous decline from the fourth to the eighth grade, while attitudes toward academic reading dropped significantly between the sixth and eighth grades. These results are consistent with the findings of the large longitudinal studies (McKenna et al., 1995; Sainsbury & Schagen, 2004) . McKenna's model (1994) predicted that the drop in reading attitudes could be a consequence of new and appealing leisure activities that become available to children during early adolescence in addition to reading. Furthermore, previous findings have suggested that adolescents define reading as a school-based activity (Pitcher et al., 2007) and often do not perceive their activities outside of school (reading magazines, newspaper and on-line materials) as reading. In the present study, recreational reading activities referred almost exclusively to reading books, and other types of reading materials were not taken into consideration. Therefore, negative attitudes might be even more prominent because students in Croatia read both fiction and non-fiction books for enjoyment less often than their peers in OECD countries, but they read magazines, and especially newspapers more often (OECD, 2010b) .",

(1995) , as well as with Kush and Watkins's (1996) findings. The obtained results align with the assumption that societal expectations lead to more positive attitudes toward reading in girls. Adolescent boys in an English study are more prone to report that they would be embarrassed if their friends saw them reading than girls (Clark & Burke, 2012) . The gender gap in reading attitudes might also at least partially stem from the types of texts used in the secondary level curriculum. Although some studies show that content of secondary curriculum does not reflect gendered interest (at least in England; Clark & Burke, 2012), or even might be more male-inclined (i.e., women were under-represented in Croatian literature textbooks both as authors of texts and as characters mentioned in these texts; Baranovi\u0107, Doolan, & Jugovi\u0107, 2010) , most of the reading materials in Croatian literature text-books are narrative, fictional texts and poems. Girls are more likely than boys to read those types of texts (OECD, 2010b) . Irwin (2003) proposed that adolescents' engagement in reading was reflective of their conceptions of themselves as readers related to their understanding of gender. Namely, they see reading as a feminine activity. That may be one of the reasons why females value reading more than males do. Pitcher et al. (2007) found that students' self-concepts as readers and their valuing of reading were associated with their general enjoyment of reading and with their specific reading choices. Reading interests often did not seem to include any form of academic reading, but they derive from perceived personal connections to a topic and from individual interests, as well as from recommendations from friends and family members. The results from the PISA study (OECD, 2010b) indicate that boys could be encouraged to enjoy reading more and to read more for enjoyment because there was considerable variation among countries in boys' enjoyment in reading.",

Generally, the findings of the path analysis indicated that, during early adolescence, gender predicted recreational reading attitudes, which consistently predicted text comprehension both directly and indirectly through metacognitive knowledge. These results are consistent with the MASRL model (Efklides, 2011) .

Engaging in reading activities, adopting effective reading strategies and being a proficient reader are mutually dependent: as students read more, they become better readers; when they read well and expect good performance in reading, they tend to read more and enjoy reading more (Nurmi, Aunola, Salmela-Aro, & Lindroos, 2003) . Students who are highly engaged in reading and have knowledge of effective reading strategies are most likely to be proficient readers, and proficient readers are also those students who are most engaged and interested in reading.

Future studies should include larger sample sizes in order to obtain more reliable results and to test more complex longitudinal models. In addition, only three schools in one city were included in the study. However, because elementary schooling is obligatory, the assessed schools were public, and all of the students in one generation were assessed, we believe that the sample was heterogeneous and representative enough, at least for urban areas. However, future studies should also consider assessing students from both urban and rural areas and from more varied socio-cultural settings.",

This study contributes to the sparse literature of the relationship between metacognition and affect in reading. The obtained results are in line with the MASRL model (Efklides, 2011) and PISA findings (OECD, 2010a (OECD, , 2010b . The suggested effect of reading attitudes on metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies was mainly supported. However, compared to academic reading attitudes, attitudes toward recreational reading were found to be more strongly related to metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies and text comprehension, especially when children were younger. Multiple educational policies have proven that encouraging recreational reading during early adolescence can improve attitudes towards reading and reading achievement. Given the importance of attitudes toward recreational reading for the development of metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies and reading comprehension, various educational practices focused on reading for enjoyment should be developed.",
