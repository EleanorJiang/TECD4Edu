    "abstract": "This research examined motivational trajectories during early adolescence in the United States and China. Upon their entry into middle school at 7th grade and every 6 months thereafter until the end of 8th grade, 825 American and Chinese children (mean age = 12.73 years) reported on their motivational beliefs (e.g., mastery orientation) and behavior (e.g., self-regulated learning strategies). The quality of children's motivational beliefs deteriorated over the 7th and 8th grades (e.g., children became less mastery oriented) in both the United States and China. American children also valued academics less, with declines in their motivational behavior as well. Chinese children continued to value academics, sustaining their motivational behavior. In both countries, children's motivational beliefs and behavior predicted their grades over time. This research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant R01 MH57505.

Such declines are evident in children's beliefs and behavior, so that as children make their way through adolescence, they become less interested and engaged in school. The motivational declines are accompanied by troubling decrements in children's achievement (see Wigfield, Eccles, Schiefele, Roeser, & Davis-Kean, 2006) . Thus, there has been much attention to understanding what underlies the motivational landscape of early adolescence. To this end, investigators have focused on children's developing psychological needs, changes in their environment, and the fit between the two as they enter adolescence (see Eccles et al., 1993) . Notably, this work has been conducted almost exclusively in the United States.",

We compared the motivation of children entering adolescence in the United States and China given the distinct learning ideologies in the two countries (Li, 2005; Tweed & Lehman, 2002) : In China (vs. the United States), learning is a priority, often viewed as a moral endeavor, with much emphasis placed on effort. The goals of the current research were twofold. First, we identified similarities and differences in the pattern of motivational changes during early adolescence in the United States and China. Second, we examined the effects of such changes on children's achievement in the two countries. Addressing these issues is of import to understanding the generalizability of motivational theories beyond Western cultures (see McInerney & Van Etten, 2001 ).",

                "text": "The motivational declines during adolescence in the United States are reflected in children's beliefs and behavior. In terms of beliefs, there is a decrease in the value children place on academic achievement, particularly as they make the transition from elementary to middle school (e.g., Eccles et al., 1989; Fredricks & Eccles, 2002) . Such diminished value is accompanied by dampened concern among children with developing competence-that is, mastery orientation (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Lepper, Corpus, & Iyengar, 2005) . As children progress through the school system, they also harbor fewer autonomous (e.g., enjoyment) versus controlled (e.g., avoidance of punishment) reasons for doing schoolwork (e.g., Harter, 1981; Lepper et al., 2005) . Children's behavior shows similar declines: Over the course of adolescence, children use fewer self-regulated learning strategies, such as planning out their studying (e.g., Kenney-Benson, Pomerantz, Ryan, & Patrick, 2006) ; they also report putting decreased effort into homework (e.g., Cooper, Lindsay, Nye, & Greathouse, 1998) and increased cheating (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 2004) . Eccles et al. (1993) make the case that the declines in American children's motivation are due to a poor stage-environment fit during early adolescence. They argue that, among other changes, early adolescence is characterized by children's heightened desire for autonomy, consciousness of the self, and concern over social relationships. Unfortunately, despite major innovations, American middle schools are often at odds with children's psychological needs (see Juvonen, Le, Kaganoff, Augustine, & Constant, 2004) . For example, children may not be provided the opportunity by teachers to make decisions to the extent they desire, thereby leaving their need for autonomy unsatisfied; middle schools may place heightened emphasis on explicit evaluation and social comparison, which is likely to put children's sense of worth at stake (see Eccles et al., 1993) . Moreover, in the United States, there is a wide range of activities outside of school, such as organized sports and community volunteer organizations, competing for students' interests (Larson & Verma, 1999) . All of this may lead to children's increasing disengagement from academics during early adolescence.",

Yet, a handful of extant studies reveal motivational declines among Chinese children during adolescence (e.g., Shi et al., 2001; Zhang & Zhang, 2006) . This may be because a poor fit between stage and environment similar to that in the United States also exists in China. Chinese middle schools place much emphasis on explicit evaluation and social comparison, due in large part to the fact that children expect to take a highly competitive exam for admission to high school after finishing middle school. Success at this exam is key for attaining a college education later, which in turn makes a larger difference than in the United States in subsequent income (Tang, Luk, & Chiu, 2000) . Moreover, in a typical Chinese classroom, teachers assume great responsibility and authority, leaving limited opportunities for students to participate in decision making (Ho, 1994; Tweed & Lehman, 2002) . Chinese teachers in middle schools also provide children with less emotional support than do teachers in elementary schools (Liu, 2004) . Indeed, Chinese seventh and eighth graders perceive their classroom climate less positively than do fourth and fifth graders (B. Chen & Li, 2008) .",

The Chinese learning ideology may also aid children in sustaining their motivation during adolescence. Several scholars have contrasted ideas about learning in East Asian countries, particularly China, with a Confucian heritage to those in Western countries, particularly the United States, with a Socratic heritage (e.g., Li, 2005; Tweed & Lehman, 2002) . In Confucian teaching, learning is more than simply the pursuit of knowledge as it is often considered in the West (Li, 2005) ; the exertion of effort in the learning context is viewed as a moral endeavor involving the lifelong task of self-improvement. Thus, academic achievement may have not only pragmatic but also moral significance. Such a ''double dose'' of importance may lead to support at school and home for the maintenance of academic effort. Indeed, there is much evidence that Chinese (vs. American) parents put greater emphasis on children's academic achievement, setting higher standards (e.g., Crystal et al., 1994) and helping children more with their homework (e.g., C. Chen & Stevenson, 1989) . There may also be fewer activities in China than in the United States that interfere with schoolwork (Larson & Verma, 1999) .",

They have made the case that the experience of autonomy as reflected in harboring autonomous versus controlled reasons for pursuits such as academics is universally critical for positive functioning. However, Iyengar and Lepper (1999) argue that this may not be the case in that children from the European-American culture, which is oriented toward independence, tend to have a greater need for autonomy than children from Asian cultures, which are oriented toward interdependence. A handful of extant studies generally show that children's motivational beliefs and behavior are associated with their achievement in similar ways in the United States and China (e.g., Fuligni & Stevenson, 1995; Stevenson et al., 1990) . For example, two studies have found that the more autonomous (vs. controlled) Chinese children's motivation, the better they do in school (d 'Ailly, 2003; Vansteenkiste, Zhou, Lens, & Soenens, 2005) .",

For one, they permit only indirect comparisons with findings among American children; such comparisons are problematic because they do not take into account sampling or methodological variations across studies. Moreover, differences in the strength of the effects cannot be identified. Another issue is that because the research conducted with Chinese children has not been longitudinal, it is not possible to determine the direction of effects between motivation and achievement. In the current research, we examined in the United States and China whether children's motivation upon their entry into middle schools at seventh grade foreshadowed their achievement 2 years later at the end of eighth grade. Moving beyond prior work, we also examined whether changes in children's motivation over the seventh and eighth grades predicted their achievement at the end of eighth grade.

The American children were recruited from two public schools in the suburbs of Chicago. Both schools consisted of 7th and 8th grades, with students primarily from working-and middle-class families; one school was of average and the other of above-average achievement level. The Chinese children were recruited from two public schools in the suburbs of Beijing, with students primarily from working-and middle-class families. One school consisted of 7th to 9th grades and was of average achievement level; the other consisted of 7th to 12th grades and was of above-average achievement level. Reflecting the national norms of each country, class size (M = 26) was smaller in the United States than in China (M = 50). An opt-in consent procedure was used.

By specifying the factor loadings from the slope to the motivation construct assessed at the four waves as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the intercept indicated children's motivation in the fall of seventh grade when the study began, and the slope indicated the linear rate of change in children's motivation across the four waves over the seventh and eighth grades.

A significant chi-square difference (Dv 2 ) relative to its degrees of freedom (Ddf) between the unconstrained and the more parsimonious constrained models was indicative that the former fit the data substantially better than the latter, revealing a between-country difference in the parameters forced to be equal in the latter (Kline, 2005; McDonald & Ho, 2002) .",

To elucidate whether the effects we observed in the between-person analyses are also evident at the within-person level, we followed the analytic strategies employed by Shim et al. (2008; see also Singer & Willett, 2003) using HLM6 (Bryk, Raudenbush, & Congdon, 2000) , which is robust to missing data.",

The approach of directly comparing the two countries in conjunction with a multiwave longitudinal design represents a major advance in extending knowledge about children's motivational development beyond the context of Western cultures. First, despite a wealth of extant research on differences in American versus Chinese children's motivation (see Pomerantz et al., 2008) , the oftenchallenging stage of early adolescence has seldom been of focus. Second, the current research directly compared fairly equivalent samples of children from the United States and China who responded to an array of statistically equivalent measures. This allowed us not only to capture broadly the motivational landscape during early adolescence in these two countries, but also to rule out a number of possible methodologic explanations. As such, the current research revealed notable similarities as well as differences in American and Chinese children's motivational trajectories during early adolescence, with such trajectories being comparably predictive of children's achievement in the two countries.",

Replicating prior research (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Lepper et al., 2005) , over the seventh and eighth grades, American children became less oriented toward mastering schoolwork; their relative autonomy, however, remained stable. Like their American counterparts, Chinese children also became less concerned with mastery over the seventh and eighth grades; their relative autonomy decreased as well, although they maintained their edge over American children. Such deterioration in the quality of American and Chinese children's motivational beliefs may reflect a mismatch in both countries between children's developing psychological needs and the school setting as they make their way through adolescence. When American and Chinese children enter adolescence, they may experience heightened desire for autonomy, self-consciousness, and concern over social relationships, but be faced with heightened emphasis on explicit evaluation, and social comparison, as well as inadequate autonomy and emotional support in school (B. Chen & Li, 2008; Eccles et al., 1993; Liu, 2004) .",

Consistent with the greater emphasis on learning in China than in the United States (see Pomerantz et al., 2008) , Chinese children began the seventh grade more positively than did their American counterparts in terms of the quality of their motivational beliefs, maintaining this advantage over the seventh and eighth grades. Moreover, the value that American, but not Chinese, children placed on academics decreased over time despite the fact that children in the two countries began seventh grade placing equal value on academics. Paralleling this trend and in line with prior research (e.g., Cooper et al., 1998; Kenney-Benson et al., 2006) , American children's motivational behavior in terms of self-regulated learning strategies and time on schoolwork outside of school declined over the seventh and eighth grades; in contrast, Chinese children's behavioral engagement remained stable. These findings are consistent with evidence for Asian (vs. American) children spending more time on schoolwork (e.g., Fuligni & Stevenson, 1995; Larson & Verma, 1999) but at odds with evidence for increases in time on schoolwork over the longer span (i.e., 5th-11th grades) among both American and Taiwanese children (Fuligni & Stevenson, 1995) . This may be because over the longer span, children are given more homework that obscures relatively smaller changes due to lack of engagement on children's part.",

For example, much evidence suggests that Chinese parents are highly involved in children's academic lives (see Pomerantz et al., 2008) ; they may sustain this involvement to a greater extent than do their American counterparts as children enter adolescence. Notably, the heightened emphasis on and support for learning and achievement in China (vs. the United States) along with the one-child policy (see Fong, 2004) may motivate both Chinese girls and boys to achieve, which is evident in the lack of sex differences in China as compared to the United States where girls were generally more motivated than were boys.",

Given the independent orientation in the United States and the interdependent orientation in China, American children may have a greater desire for autonomy than do Chinese children (Iyengar & Lepper, 1999) . In addition, American children may have more alternatives (e.g., organized sports and community volunteer organizations) to academics (Larson & Verma, 1999 ) that draw their attention away from school. The differential motivational trajectories may also be due to differences in the structures of the schools in the two countries. In the current research, the two schools in the United States housed 7th and 8th grades only, whereas in China, one school went up to 9th grade and another up to 12th grade, with children in both schools expecting a highly competitive admission examination to high school at the end of 9th grade. It is possible that because American children anticipate another school transition in the near future without much continuity from the present, their motivation decreases. In contrast, because Chinese children expect a crucial examination depending to a large extent on their continued engagement in school, they sustain their motivation.",

Surprisingly, contrary to some prior concurrent research (e.g., Grolnick, Ryan, & Deci, 1991) , this was not the case in the United States (for a similar finding of lack of effect, see Grolnick & Slowiaczek, 1994) . Moreover, in both countries, no effect of change in relative autonomy over time on children's achievement was evident in either the between-or within-person analyses. One possible explanation is that dampened relative autonomy resulting from having controlled (vs. autonomous) reasons for pursuing academics may not necessarily harm achievement as it may heighten the effort children put into such things as rote learning, which pays off in terms of performance when deep learning is not required (see Vansteenkiste, Simons, Lens, Soenens, & Matos, 2005) .",

Although the quality of both American and Chinese children's motivational beliefs may decrease as they make their way through early adolescence, which appears to disrupt their learning as reflected in their grades, American children's learning may be further impaired by declines in their valuing of and behavior toward academics. In contrast, Chinese children continue to value academics and maintain their behavioral engagement in schoolwork, which may counter, or at least mute, the negative effects on learning of the decline in the quality of their motivational beliefs. However, although the sustained value and behavior among Chinese children may bode well for their achievement, it may take an emotional toll on them. As the quality of Chinese children's motivational beliefs deteriorates, they may come to experience their engagement in schoolwork as not only tedious but also pressured, which may cause emotional problems (see Ho, 1994) . Of course, key to examining the contribution of the differences in American and Chinese children's motivation to the differences in their learning is to assess children's achievement with tests that are directly comparable between the two countries (see Stevenson et al., 1993) . The current research, however, only examined children's grades which were based on different criteria in the United States and China, leaving the ''learning gap'' between the two countries uninvestigated.",

First, children's motivation was assessed exclusively through children's reports. Although self-reports have the merit of revealing subjective experience that is essential in understanding children's motivational beliefs, future research using multiple informants will provide a more complete picture of children's motivational development. Second, we speculated that the similarities in children's motivational trajectories in the United States and China reflect a similar poor fit in the two countries between children's developmental stage and their environment as they enter adolescence, but we did not actually assess stage-environment fit. Although some investigators have suggested that there are changes in the environment from elementary to middle school in China that may be a poor fit to children's developmental stage (e.g., Liu, 2004; Zhang & Zhang, 2006) , empirical evidence on the issue is yet to emerge (e.g., B. Chen & Li, 2008) . Similarly, we attributed the motivational differences to the distinct learning ideologies in the United States and China, but such ideologies were not examined. Also of note is that motivational dimensions based on notions indigenous to the Chinese culture such as social motivation (Yu, 1996) did not receive attention in the current research.",

First, the current research examined an important developmental period following children for 2 years upon their entry into middle school, but for a more comprehensive view of cultural variations in children's motivational development, future research spanning longer periods is needed to cover further academic milestones in the United States and China (e.g., entrance into high school and college). A significant issue that remains is whether Chinese children never experience motivational declines to the same extent as their American counterparts do, or they do, but not until they enter middle to late adolescence. Second, in the current research, fairly homogenous urban samples in each country were recruited. Questions remain regarding within-culture variations. For example, the pragmatic and moral significance of academic achievement may be maintained or transformed to different extents in different regions in China as they undergo economic and sociocultural changes to different extents.",

Despite such differences, the mutually facilitative effects between motivation and achievement are comparable in the United States and China: Heightened motivational beliefs and behavior upon entry into middle school in the fall of seventh grade as well as the better preservation of such motivation over time are predictive of enhanced performance over time, with evidence for feedback effects of performance on motivation. The current research advances the understanding of the role of culture in motivational development in showing both culture-specific and culture-general processes. It also underscores Juvonen et al.'s (2004) call for continued efforts to improve middle schools in the United States, highlighting the necessity of such efforts in China as well.",
