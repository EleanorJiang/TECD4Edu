    "abstract": "For decades, researchers have proclaimed the positive psychosocial benefits of participation in physical activity. However, recent meta-analyses of the literature have found infrequent and inconclusive empirical support for the link between physical activity and psychosocial well-being. In this study, we use data from a longitudinal study to explore the links between participation in physical activity and global self-esteem among girls from childhood into early adolescence and the direction of this relationship. Methods: Participants included 197 non-Hispanic white girls. Girls' participation in physical activity and their global self-esteem were assessed when they were 9, 11, and 13 years old. Panel regression was used to assess the lagged effect of physical activity on self-esteem and the lagged effect of self-esteem on physical activity, controlling for family socioeconomic status (SES) and girls' body mass index (BMI). Results: A significant lagged effect of physical activity on self-esteem was identified. Specifically, higher physical activity at ages 9 and 11 years predicted higher self-esteem at ages 11 and 13 years respectively, controlling for covariates. Positive effects of physical activity on self-esteem were most apparent at age 11 and for girls with higher BMI. No support was gained for the lagged effect of selfesteem on physical activity. Conclusions: Results suggest that participating in physical activity can lead to positive self-esteem among adolescent girls, particularly for younger girls and those at greatest risk of overweight. These findings highlight the necessity of promoting physical activity among adolescent girls as a method of fostering positive self-worth.",

Mental health benefits of physical activity may result from increases in social support and a sense of mastery as well as changes in noradrenaline and neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin [1] . Recent reviews of the literature, however, indicate that empirical support for the link between participation in physical activity and psychosocial well-being is infrequent and inconclusive [2] [3] [4] [5] . With this in mind, this study assesses the longitudinal association between physical activity and global self-esteem in a sample of adolescent girls, a population at risk for depression and low selfesteem [6] [7] [8] .",

Higher levels of self-esteem are associated with increased self-efficacy, body image, and leadership, and reduced levels of depression and anxiety [5, 9] . As outlined in recent reviews [2, 5, 10] , few studies have examined the link between physical activity and self-esteem among adolescent girls, and no studies have tested the direction of this association. Given the low rates of physical activity participation in this population [11] , these are important questions to address. The lack of detailed information on the relationship between physical activity and psychosocial well-being impedes the development of effective intervention programs. More specifically, it is not clear whether increasing self-esteem may lead to higher physical activity among girls or whether increasing physical activity may lead to higher self-esteem. Both are worthy efforts to pursue, but conclusive evidence of an association between physical activity and self-esteem and the direction of this effect will ensure more effective use of limited intervention resources.",

Although there are no validity data available for the activity checklist, activities included on the checklist are consistent with preferred activities as reported by youth living in rural areas. Youth in rural areas have different interests and opportunities than youth living in urban or metropolitan areas. It was therefore important that the measure appropriately reflect the needs and interest of this group. The most preferred activities among rural youth, as identified by Savage and Scott [15] include tennis, volleyball, swimming, softball, bicycling, football, ice skating, backpacking and hiking, and weightlifting.

That is, the effect of physical activity age at 9 on self-esteem at age 11 is stronger than the effect of physical activity at age 11 on self-esteem at age 13. Second, the positive effect of physical activity on self-esteem increases as BMI increases. This effect is illustrated more clearly in Figure 1 . More specifically, at one standard deviation above the mean BMI z-score, a one-unit increase in activity at age 9 increases self-esteem at age 11 by .13 point, whereas a one-unit increase in activity at age 11 exerts about one-third that magnitude (.04) on self-esteem at age 13 years. At two standard deviations above the mean BMI, a one-unit increase in activity at age 9 increases self-esteem at age 11 by .20 point; whereas a one-unit increase in activity at age 11 years yields a .11-point increase in self-esteem at age 13. The reverse pattern is noted for girls with a BMI z-score below the mean. This effect, however, was only noted at age 13. For these girls, a one standard deviation increase in physical activity at age 11 is associated with a .10-. 17-unit decrease in self-esteem at age 13 years.",

Yet few longitudinal studies have assessed the association or the directionality of the relationship between physical activity and psychosocial well-being, particularly self-esteem, in an adolescent population. Using individual growth models, we investigated the lagged effect of physical activity on self-esteem and the lagged effect of self-esteem on physical activity among girls aged 9-13 years. No support was found for the lagged effect of self-esteem on physical activity. In contrast, higher participation in physical activity at ages 9 and 11 years predicted higher self-esteem at ages 11 and 13 years, respectively, illustrating a lagged effect of physical activity on self-esteem. These effects, however, differed by age and BMI, suggesting stronger effects at younger ages for girls who were more overweight. Results from this longitudinal study provide more definitive evidence than previous cross-sectional research of the psychosocial benefits of physical activity [12, 29, 30] and concur with findings based on older populations [12] .",

The effect of physical activity at age 9 on self-esteem at age 11 years was stronger than the effect of physical activity at age 11 on self-esteem at age 13. It is possible that this result is caused by social expectations of gender behavior, developmental differences in adherence to these expectations among youth, and the confusing messages that girls receive regarding the role of women in society. Previous research has suggested that, as children, boys and girls are afforded latitude to pursue activities and behaviors regardless of social expectations of gender, without risk of stigma [30] . As a result, younger girls may readily experience the positive psychosocial effects of participation in physical activity. However, as children approach adolescence, they become more rigid in their perceptions of gender and latitudes of behavior [30] . For adolescent girls, this means a decrease in traditionally masculine activities, such as participation in physical activity. According to social ideals of gender, participation in physical activity is contrary to what adolescent girls may perceive they should do as they develop into young women (i.e., the notion that participation in physical activity un-feminine) [31] [32] [33] . In this social context, adolescent girls who are physically active are operating in opposition to what is expected of them, thereby decreasing the likelihood that they will experience the psychosocial benefits of physical activity. These suggestions are purely speculative, however, and warrant further investigation.",

At ages 11 and 13, the positive effect of physical activity on self-esteem was more apparent for girls with above-average BMI than for girls with average BMI. It is interesting to consider the potential reasons why the positive effects of physical activity on self-esteem are disproportionately experienced by girls with a higher than average BMI. Given that all girls reported relatively high self-esteem in this sample regardless of weight status, effects of physical activity on self-esteem for girls with high BMI cannot be explained by particularly low levels of self-esteem in this group. It is possible that girls with above-average BMI scores may garner the benefits of participation in physical activity more tangibly in that they are apt to lose weight, whether intended or not, as a result of being active than their average and below-average BMI colleagues. It is also possible that participation in physical activity is linked with greater increases in self-efficacy and perceived competence, and in turn self-esteem, among girls with a high BMI in comparison to girls with a lower BMI. Similarly, girls with high BMI may experience a greater increase in peer connectedness than their leaner colleagues as a result of being physically active. As with possible explanations for the moderating effect of age, these suggestions were not examined in the current study and are possible questions for future research.",

This effect was noted at age 13 years only. Of note in this instance, however, are the large standard deviations around values for low BMI as shown in Figure 1 . This result is counterintuitive but may reflect concerns regarding physical appearance and weight that are common among girls as they enter puberty [34] . Previous researchers have contended that there is a negative relationship between participation in physical activity and psychosocial well-being if participation is sought for weight loss or body image purposes [35, 36] . In this sample of white middle-class girls, it is possible that girls with below-average BMI were physically active for extrinsically motivated reasons such as body image or weight loss.

Given racial and ethnic differences in self-esteem and body image [37] [38] [39] , as well as pressure from family and friends to lose weight or participate in physical activity [40] , it is likely that the mental health benefits of physical activity differ across races and ethnicities. Second, we did not have access to an objective (and direct) measure of physical activity, such as accelerometers, at all times of assessment. As a result, physical activity was assessed using a combination of self-report measures, with limited reliability and validity, and physical fitness, an indirect measure of physical activity. We used an aggregate score of physical activity based on all measures of physical activity as a means of reducing concerns in this regard. Finally, girls in general reported high levels of self-esteem. A ceiling effect of self-esteem would decrease the ability to identify a positive association between physical activity and self-esteem. As a result, findings from this study may underestimate the benefits of physical activity on self-esteem in the general population of adolescent girls.",

Future research can build on results from this study by assessing similar associations in a more diverse sample of adolescents and with other measures of mental health and by using objective and direct measures of physical activity.
