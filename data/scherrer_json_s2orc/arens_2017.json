Extending previous research on the reciprocal effects model (REM), this study tests (1) the assumption of developmental equilibrium as time-invariant crosslagged paths from self-concept to achievement and from achievement to self-concept, (2) the generalizability of reciprocal relations when using school grades and standardized achievement test scores as achievement indicators, and (3) the invariance of findings across secondary school achievement tracks. Math self-concept, school grades in math, and math achievement test scores were measured once each school year with a representative sample of 3,425 German students.

The findings supported the assumption of developmental equilibrium for reciprocal effects between self-concept and achievement across time.

                "text": "When examining the link between academic self-concept and academic achievement, many studies have attested substantial cross-sectional relations (e.g., Arens, Yeung, Craven, & Hasselhorn, 2011; Marsh et al., 2013) . Studies scrutinizing longitudinal relations have attracted even more attention because they help elucidate causality in the relation between self-concept and achievement. Thus, a critical question has been whether selfconcept is an outcome of achievement or whether achievement is an outcome of self-concept. Calsyn and Kenny (1977) posited two models for the temporal relation between self-concept and achievement. While the skill development model suggests that achievement predicts self-concept, the self-enhancement model suggests that self-concept predicts achievement. Originally, the skill development and self-enhancement models were strictly contrasted but recent research indicates that such a clear either-or stance is inappropriate because self-concept and achievement share mutually reinforcing relations. Therefore, in contemporary self-concept research, the reciprocal effects model (REM) prevails for depicting the relations between self-concept and achievement. Accordingly, self-concept is both an outcome of former and a predictor of subsequent achievement (e.g., Huang, 2011; M\u00f6ller, Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2011; Niepel, Brunner, & Preckel, 2014) .",

The assumption of developmental equilibrium would expect skill development and self-enhancement paths to be of similar size from one wave to the next (for studies integrating related assumptions see, e.g., Marsh, Craven, et al., 2016; Marshall, Parker, Ciarrochi, & Heaven, 2014) .

For complex models resulting from the assessment of self-concept and achievement across many waves with many items used in each wave, the added parsimony provides more robust and precise estimates and facilitates the presentation and interpretation of results. Moreover, support for developmental equilibrium offers some protection against alternative interpretations of the results based on potential other variables not considered (Kenny, 1975) . More importantly, if developmental equilibrium can be supported, self-concept (achievement) exerts a similar influence on later achievement (self-concept) at different time points. Hence, studies testing developmental equilibrium are best based on a large number of measurement waves which cover a long and relevant period of time. For instance, it would be interesting to examine the robustness of skill development and self-enhancement effects across adolescence or secondary school years.",

Thus, there seems to be a need for further studies that include more than two or three measurement waves. In line with these considerations, the present study covers five waves tracking German students from the fifth to the ninth grade. Students' self-concept and achievement were collected once every school year. Therefore, the present study can replicate findings on the REM over an exceptionally long time interval and examine developmental equilibrium across students' fifth to ninth grade, the years of mandatory secondary schooling in Germany.",

                "text": "The REM is commonly tested by cross-lagged panel models embedded in the framework of structural equation modeling (SEM; Curran & Bollen, 2001; . This modeling approach includes autoregressive or stability paths estimating the effect of one variable on the same variable across subsequent measurement waves, for example, the relation between selfconcept measured at Time 1 (T1) and self-concept measured at Time 2 (T2). In addition, cross-lagged paths represent the reciprocal relations of one variable on another variable between measurement waves (i.e., effects of self-concept at T1 on achievement at T2 and effects of achievement at T1 on self-concept at T2). In studies that cover more than two measurement waves, it is possible to include both first-order and higher order paths. First-order paths depict the relation between two directly adjacent time points, that is, the effect of self-concept at T1 on self-concept at T2 as an example of a first-order stability path, and the effect of selfconcept at T1 on achievement at T2 as an example of a first-order cross-lagged path. First-order paths thus describe \"lag 1\" paths referring to the effect of one variable on the same variable across two adjacent measurement waves. Higher-order paths describe the relations between constructs measured at more distal time points. Second-order paths refer to \"lag 2\" paths among constructs measured at T1 and T3, third-order paths refer to \"lag 3\" paths among constructs measured at T1 and T4 and so on. Thus, for instance, second-order stability addresses the relation between self-concept measured at T1 and self-concept measured at T3, and second-order cross-lagged paths depict the reciprocal relations between selfconcept at T1 and achievement at T3.",

School grades are very salient to students as they are directly communicated, easy to compare among classmates, and entail important implications for students' school careers. School grades do not only narrowly represent student achievement but also refer to other student characteristics such as students' effort or classroom behavior (Brookhart, 1993; McMillan, Myran, & Workman, 2002; Zimmermann, Sch\u00fctte, Taskinen, & K\u00f6ller, 2013) . On the other hand, students are often unaware of their relative performance on standardized achievement tests. Therefore, students' self-concept has been found to be more strongly related to school grades than to standardized achievement test scores (Marsh et al., 2014; Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, K\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 2005) .",

Hence, teachers use the classroom as a narrow frame of reference in their grading procedure. Accordingly, the same student with the same level of objective achievement can receive divergent grades depending on the average achievement and achievement standards in the individual student's class. For this reason, school grades are difficult to compare across classes, schools, and nations whereas standardized achievement tests are particularly designed for the purpose of such comparisons. Thus, school grades and standardized achievement test scores each have their advantages and disadvantages when they are used as achievement indicators, emphasizing their distinct yet complementary nature.",

Nonetheless, the majority of studies supporting reciprocal relations between self-concept and achievement have included school grades as achievement indicators (e.g., Marsh, 1990; Niepel et al., 2014 ; for an overview see Huang, 2011 ). Yet, there is also evidence that reciprocal relations between self-concept and achievement exist when using standardized achievement test scores as achievement indicators (M\u00f6ller, Zimmermann, & K\u00f6ller, 2014; Retelsdorf et al., 2014; Seaton, Parker, Marsh, Craven, & Yeung, 2014) . However, most previous studies have considered school grades or achievement test scores separately whereas a more sophisticated approach would be to consider both achievement indicators simultaneously. The study of Marsh, Trautwein, et al. (2005) provided evidence of the REM for math self-concept and math achievement when analyzing math grades and math test scores separately as well as when combining them into one model. As this study included only two measurement waves, there still seems to be a need for studies that combine both achievement indicators and consider multiple waves across a longer time interval to more adequately test the validity of the REM and the assumption of developmental equilibrium for both kinds of achievement indicators.",

This is surprising because many educational systems implement at least some kind of tracking, particularly in secondary education (Chmielewski, Dumont, & Trautwein, 2013; LeTendre, Hofer, & Shimizu, 2003) . Students attending different achievement tracks seem to differ in various respects. For instance, they have been found to reveal different levels of academic achievement, motivation (e.g., interest), and academic self-concept (e.g., Baumert, Watermann, & Sch\u00fcmer, 2003; Becker, L\u00fcdtke, Trautwein, & Baumert, 2006; Hanushek & W\u00f6\u2424mann, 2006; K\u00f6ller & Baumert, 2001 ). This finding might be partly due to differences in the students' learning environments. Students attending high-achievement tracks have been found to receive higher levels of instructional quality and to experience fewer disciplinary problems in the classroom, but also to get lower levels of individual learning support from the teacher compared to students in lower achievement track schools (Klieme & Rakoczy, 2003; Kunter et al., 2005) . The present study aims to investigate and compare the REM among students attending different secondary school tracks as this provides an opportunity to test the generalizability of the REM across students experiencing different learning environments and educational opportunities.",

High levels of student achievement have also often been linked to a high IQ (Frey & Detterman, 2004; Furnham & Monsen, 2009; Spinath, Spinath, & Plomin, 2008) . Furthermore, student achievement is associated with gender. Specifically, girls display higher achievement in verbal subjects (De Fraine, Van Damme, & Onghena, 2007; Van de gaer, Pustjens, Van Damme, & De Munter, 2008) including reading (Lietz, 2006; Mullis, Martin, Kennedy, & Foy, 2007) . The findings related to math are less clear and seem to vary contingent upon the achievement indicator. Some studies have found higher scores for boys on standardized math achievement tests (Brunner, Krauss, & Kunter, 2008; Matteucci & Mignani, 2011; Van de gaer et al., 2008) , but other studies have reported no or only small gender differences (Hyde, Fennema, & Lamon, 1990; Nowell & Hedges, 1998) . When considering school grades in math, girls were found to obtain higher grades than boys (Marsh & Yeung, 1998) , although other studies could not find any gender differences (Marsh, Trautwein, et al., 2005) . Regarding domainspecific academic self-concepts, there is consistent evidence for gender differences which are in line with gender stereotypes. Hence, girls show higher levels of verbal self-concept whereas boys display higher levels of math self-concept Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, & Wigfield, 2002; Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2004) .",

Moreover, this study examines the generalizability of reciprocal effects between math self-concept and math achievement across German students attending three different achievement tracks. The analytic approach starts with a complex full-forward model before turning to more parsimonious models in order to consider and test the adequacy of first-order and higher order stability and cross-lagged paths. School grades and standardized achievement test scores are simultaneously considered in combined models to account for the two most widely used yet distinctive achievement indicators (Marsh, Trautwein, et al., 2005; Marsh et al., 2014) . Finally, gender, IQ, and SES are considered as covariates to control for other important variables influencing students' self-concept and achievement.",

PALMA is a large-scale longitudinal study investigating the development of math achievement and its determinants (e.g., math-related motivation, classroom instruction, family variables) during secondary school in Germany. The study was conducted in the German federal state of Bavaria and covers six measurement waves spanning grades 5 to 10 with one measurement point each school year. Sampling and the assessments were conducted by the German Data Processing and Research Center of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The sample represented the typical student population in the German federal state of Bavaria in terms of secondary school achievement tracks and student characteristics such as gender, urban versus rural location, and SES. Participation rate at the school level was 100%. At the first measurement wave in grade 5, the sample comprised 2,070 students (49.6% female, 37.2% lowachievement track students, 27.1% middle-achievement track students, and 35.7% high-achievement track students). The students then had a mean age of 11.75 years (SD \u03ed 0.68), which is the typical age for fifth grade students in Germany. A number of 42 schools participated in the study and two classes were randomly drawn within each school for final participation. For the subsequent data collections, the study did not only track the students who had already participated in the earlier assessments, but also included students who more recently entered classrooms participating in the PALMA study and thus had not yet participated in the study (for more details on the sampling procedure, see Pekrun et al., 2007) .",

Low-achievement track students commonly leave school after the ninth grade with a qualification allowing them to apply for an apprenticeship, middleachievement track schools end after the tenth grade and students may begin vocational training, and high-achievement track students attend school until the thirteenth grade after which they may enter university. For reasons of including low-achievement track students, the present study focuses on the first five measurement waves covering students grade 5 to 9. The final sample of the present study consists of 3,425 students (n \u03ed 1,714, 50.0% girls; n \u03ed 1,710, 49.9% boys; n \u03ed 1, 0.01% no gender) and included all students who participated in at least one of the five assessments.

This test was explicitly designed for the PALMA study serving to measure students' development of math competencies across secondary school years. Thus, different test versions are available for the different grade levels. The conception of this test has substantially and methodologically been linked to the concept underlying the math tests applied in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Following the construct of mathematical literacy, the test operationalizes math competences as mathematical modeling and problem solving in terms of students' abilities to convert real-world problems into mathematical models, to solve these problems in the context of mathematical models, and to transfer the solutions to reality. On the basis of this conceptualization, the test targets students' modeling competencies and algorithmic competencies in arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. Methodologically, the test was constructed within the framework of item response theory (IRT; Wu, Adams, Wilson, & Haldane, 2007) . At each measurement point, students worked on one of two different parallel test versions with 60 to 90 items each, the exact number of items varying across waves. The items were formulated either as multiple-choice or open-ended items. Prespecified guidelines were given to two trained raters to score the open-ended items. The ratings showed a high level of interrater agreement supporting their objectivity (i.e., interrater disagreement for the test version A [the parallel to version B] was 0.04% [0.13%], thus 0.085% on average). Depending on the measurement wave, approximately 20 anchor items served to link the two parallel test versions within each measurement point and the different tests across the five measurement points. Achievement test scores were scaled using one-parameter logistic IRT applying concurrent calibration (Rasch scaling; Wu et al., 2007) that has been found to have many advantages (e.g., model parsimony, parameter linearity) relative to alternative models (Liu, 2010; Wright, 1999) and that was also used in previous studies utilizing the PALMA math achievement test (Murayama et al., 2013) . The reliability of item separation in IRT scaling was 0.99.",

The Mplus option \u03fd type \u03ed complex \u03fe was used to accommodate the hierarchical nature of the study. Specifically, students were nested within the 42 participating schools and students attending the same school might be more similar to each other than students from different schools, resulting in nonindependence of observations. Failure to attend to the hierarchical nature of the data could lead to biased standard errors-a miscalculation that is corrected by this Mplus model command (Muth\u00e9n & Satorra, 1995) . 1 As inherent in any longitudinal study, the data set consisted of missing values on the measured variables which should be appropriately dealt with. In this study, missingness on variables mainly originates from the fact that students entered the study at later measurement waves without having completed the measures at earlier waves. The attrition rate could be kept rather low during the time period covered in the present study, that is, up to grade 9 after which the attrition rate is higher due to the low-achievement track students' leaving school. More concretely, among the total sample 1 It was not possible to use students' classes as a clustering variable because the composition of students' classes changed across time.

This model incorporates all possible first-order and higher order paths and only replaces the correlations among constructs by path coefficients. Therefore, it is statistically equivalent to Model 5 and results in the same fit. The path coefficients of Model 6 (see Table S6 in the online supplemental materials) suggest that multicollinearity might be at play since some coefficients for self-concept-achievement relations had implausible negative and small coefficients (Marsh, Dowson, Pietsch, & Walker, 2004) . Hence, the full-forward model (Model 6) was compared to a less complex model (Model 7), which included only first-order stability and cross-lagged paths. The fit of Model 7 declined substantially compared to the full-forward Model 6 (\u232cCFI \u03ed \u03ea.017; \u232cRMSEA \u03ed \u03e9.008), suggesting that the inclusion of any higher order paths seems to be warranted. In Model 8, we integrated first-order and higher order stability paths, but only first-order cross-lagged paths. Here, the fit was highly similar to the fit resulting from the full-forward Model 6. However, when assuming first-order and higher order cross-lagged paths along with first-order stability paths (Model 9), the model fit substantially declined compared to the full-forward Model 6 (\u232cCFI \u03ed \u03ea.015; \u232cRMSEA \u03ed \u03e9.008).

Model 12 extends Model 11 in terms of invariance constraints on the stability coefficients. More concretely, Model 12 assumed the first-order and higher order stability paths of all three constructs (i.e., math self-concept, math grades, and math achievement test scores) to be of equal size across measurement waves for the three school tracks.

The model fit remained stable supporting the appropriateness of this highly restrictive model. When consid-ering the resulting standardized path coefficients of this final model (see Table 2 ), it is obvious that math self-concept and math achievement (both school grades and test scores) were best predicted by their former levels given the substantial positive coefficients for the first-order stability paths. However, the significant higher order stability estimates imply that the stability of constructs does not only address consecutive waves but goes further. Second, the findings demonstrated reciprocal relations between math self-concept and math achievement both in terms of school grades and achievement test scores. The cross-lagged paths leading from math self-concept to math achievement and those leading from math achievement to math self-concept were positive and significant across all measurement waves in the three groups of students irrespective of whether achievement was operationalized by school grades or achievement test scores. Considering the effects of the covariates, gender was found to have a significant effect on math self-concept with boys displaying higher levels. Moreover, students with a higher IQ demonstrated higher levels of math self-concept whereas students' SES was found to be unrelated to math self-concept. Boys and girls were found to obtain similar school grades in math, whereas students of higher SES and higher IQ were found to earn higher grades.

As exemplified in this study, such a complex model can serve as the starting point for deriving and empirically testing more parsimonious and less complex models. Accordingly, we could demonstrate that there was no additional benefit of including both first-order and higher order cross-lagged paths, but the incorporation of both first-order and higher order stability paths contributed to significantly better models.

Consistent with previous studies Jacobs et al., 2002; Watt, 2004) , boys were found to display higher levels of math self-concept. Boys were also found to perform better on the math achievement test, but boys and girls obtained similar school grades in math. This finding corresponds to previous studies indicating that gender differences in math achievement might vary contingent upon the achievement indicator used, and that despite boys' consistent superior levels of math self-concept, gender differences in math achievement are less consistent (Hyde et al., 1990; Leahey & Guo, 2001; Lindberg, Hyde, Petersen, & Linn, 2010) . Future research should also consider the situation and environmental circumstances in which students' math achievement is assessed. For example, according to the stereotype threat paradigm (Nguyen & Ryan, 2008; Steele, 1997) , females' math achievement might be lower when the stereotype that girls are poorer in math than boys is activated, as compared to test situations when this gender stereotype is not prevalent.",

                "text": "This study followed a traditional cross-lagged modeling approach to investigate reciprocal effects between self-concept and achievement which delivers easily interpretable results and facilitates comparability across numerous previous studies on the REM that also utilized this approach (e.g., Guay et al., 2003; Marsh et al., 2007; Marsh, Trautwein, et al., 2005; M\u00f6ller et al., 2011 M\u00f6ller et al., , 2014 Niepel et al., 2014; Seaton et al., 2014) . However, the standard cross-lagged panel modeling approach has recently been criticized (Hamaker, Kuiper, & Grasman, 2015) mainly because of the lacking separation between the within-person level and the between-person level which would enable consideration of traitlike (i.e., stable) individual differences. Hence, it might be worthwhile to consider the application of proposed alternative models to the REM in the future. Alternative models should also be taken into account for the math achievement test. In this study, achievement test scores were scaled based on a one-parameter logistic IRT model, but alternative estimations including two-parameter models could be used in order to test the generalizability of findings. Indeed, there has been a long debate on the advantages of oneparameter relative to two-parameter IRT models (Bergan, 2013) , and this debate might benefit from the application and comparison of both approaches to the same study and research question.",

The robustness of reciprocal effects was further substantiated by the generalizability of the findings across achievement indicators and school tracks even when controlling for important covariates. As such, although the REM has been well established and become an inherent characteristic of the self-concept construct , the present study has pointed out remaining important questions on reciprocal self-concept-achievement relations, delivered answers to these questions, and once again underscored the generalizability and robustness of the REM at least for secondary school students.",
