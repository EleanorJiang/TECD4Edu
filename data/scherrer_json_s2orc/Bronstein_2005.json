An intrinsic orientation refers to the performance of behaviors that are motivated by interest or enjoyment in the activity itself, whereas an extrinsic orientation refers to the performance of behaviors that are motivated by external rewards or consequences (Rigby et al., 1992) . Researchers consistently have found a significant relation between children's motivational orientation and both learning and academic performance (Ginsburg and Bronstein, 1993; Gottfried, 1990; Grolnick and Ryan, 1989; Harter and Connell, 1984) . Specifically, children whose academic behavior is intrinsically motivated have been found to do better academically (Ginsburg and Bronstein, 1993; Grolnick and Ryan, 1989) , feel more academically competent, and perceive themselves as having greater control over their level of 1 University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont. 2 Associate Professor, Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine.

However, because both types of motivation may occur in the same child, depending on individual and contextual factors, it is useful to regard motivational orientation as a continuum-with a tendency more toward one direction than the other-rather than as a simple intrinsic-vs.-extrinsic dichotomy.",

A number of laboratory studies have found that aspects of the environment that can be considered controlling rather than autonomy-supporting-such as deadlines, rewards, and surveillance-tend to lower intrinsic motivation by shifting the perceived locus of causality from internal to external (see Ryan, 1985, 1987; Lepper and Greene, 1978, for reviews) . In addition, there is a growing body of research on the role of socializing agents in the development of children's academic motivational orientation, which suggest that parenting style may have an important influence. Early studies by Baumrind (1967 Baumrind ( , 1971 found that preschool children of parents categorized as authoritative (i.e., encouraging children's individuality and open communication, while also exerting control by establishing and enforcing rules) were more self-motivated, achievement-oriented, and sociable in a nursery school setting than were children whose parents were categorized as either authoritarian (emphasizing obedience and conformity) or permissive (making few demands on children and not enforcing rules).",

Thus, it was not possible to consider longer-term effects of socialization or to examine the directionality of the relations that were found-e.g., whether children's previous poor performance in school and low intrinsic motivation might also lead parents to become more controlling. As well, the relations among the child outcomes warrant additional study-in particular, to investigate whether intrinsic motivation is an antecedent or consequence of academic achievement. Finally, the overall developmental process needs to be considered further, regarding whether parenting leads to one outcome via the other-i.e., whether a particular parental style fosters intrinsic motivation which in turn leads to higher achievement, or whether a parental style fosters higher achievement, which then leads children to development a more intrinsic motivational orientation to schoolwork.",

The authors found that parents' involvement in children's academic and social lives was related to children's autonomous self-regulation, but that self-regulation did not predict achievement. Gottfried et al. (1994 Gottfried et al. ( , 1998 , examining children's' self-reports of academic intrinsic motivation both in verbal subjects (e.g., reading and social studies) and math, found parenting practices to be a concurrent and longitudinal predictor of academic intrinsic motivation; in addition, they found that intrinsic motivation at age nine predicted both intrinsic motivation and achievement at age ten (Gottfried et al., 1994) . However, because there was no measure of achievement at age nine, it was not possible to know the extent to which achievement might also have predicted intrinsic motivation over time. Furthermore, in an earlier study, Gottfried (1990) found that although children's earlier self-reported intrinsic motivation was associated with later achievement across subjects, the strongest associations were between earlier achievement and later intrinsic motivation. Thus, in considering the effects of parenting on children's academic outcomes, there remain some questions concerning the relations among the variables and the directionality of effects.",

The middle school years are a particularly important period for the examination of factors related to motivational orientation. Whereas in the primary grades, generally children have one main teacher who knows them well and who monitors their work habits and academic performance, in middle school, they often have different teachers for different subjects, each of whom they see for 1 period per day. Because children in middle school are therefore likely to receive far less overall guidance and attention, internal motivational factors may become more relevant in relation to ongoing school success. Further, as Eccles et al. (1984) pointed out in their review of the effects of school environments on achievement motivation, classrooms in middle schools and junior high schools are generally more formal and teacher-controlled than are those in elementary school, with less opportunity for student choices and responsibility in the learning process. They concluded that a decrease in student autonomy and control in such environments was likely to lead to a decrease in intrinsic motivation. Thus, given those classroom factors during the middle-level school years, parental influences may become especially important in helping children to develop and maintain an intrinsic motivation for learning.",

Some of its more obvious forms are directives, demands, surveillance, criticism, and punishment. Promising and providing extrinsic rewards for school performance are also forms of external control, using enticements to induce children to conform to parental wishes. Although these two approaches are very different in their affective valence, the outcomes may be similar. Children whose parents use pressure and coercion to get them to attend to their schoolwork, or offer gifts and contingent rewards to induce them to work harder, may come to believe that schoolwork is aversive-something they have to be forced or enticed to do. In regard to more harshly controlling behaviors, children whose parents are critical and shaming may internalize those messages, and thereby lose confidence in their own abilities (Rigby et al., 1992) -becoming less likely to exert effort in school, or approaching schoolwork in a haphazard way. Doing little or poor schoolwork may also become a means for challenging harsh parental authority, with resulting negative effects on achievement. In these various ways, parental external control may serve to undermine achievement and intrinsic motivation in the academic domain.",

This approach is similar in some ways to the permissive style described by Baumrind (1967 Baumrind ( , 1971 in her studies of preschoolers and their parents, which included low control coupled with a fairly high degree of warmth. However, it is more suggestive of the indifferent-uninvolved parenting style proposed by Maccoby and Martin (1983) , which involved laxity and emotional distance, and the lack of structure and low level of interest and involvement in children's lives described by Grolnick and Ryan (1989) .",

We reasoned that autonomy-supporting parental behavior would tend to foster achievement, and that higher achieving children would tend to feel more confident of their academic abilities and thus become more intrinsically motivated in dealing with the academic challenges of middle school. Conversely, parental external control and lack of guidance would tend not to foster academic achievement or might undermine it, and lower achieving children would be less likely to perceive themselves as scholastically competent, or to develop an intrinsic motivational orientation.

As in the SPCC, each subscale contains 6 items and 4 responses choices, with children asked to indicate which of a pair of opposite statements is \"really\" or \"sort of\" true for them. Subscale scores are obtained by averaging their item scores, with higher totals indicating a more intrinsic motivational orientation; thus subscale scores represent children's average motivational tendency along an intrinsic-extrinsic continuum. A higher order factor analysis (Harter and Connell, 1984) revealed 2 factors, which formed the basis for 2 composites labeled Intrinsic Mastery Motivation and Autonomous Judgment; they will be referred to here respectively as Mastery and Judgment. Mastery includes the Preference for Challenge, Curiosity/Interest, and Independent Mastery subscales. It is a purely motivational component that describes what children prefer or do in their approach to schoolwork (e.g., \"Some kids read things because they are interested in the subject . . . BUT . . . Other kids read things because the teacher wants them to\"). Judgment includes the Internal Criteria and Independent Judgment subscales. It reflects the extent to which children trust their own opinions and evaluations of their work or whether they rely on others' judgments (e.g., \"Some kids almost always think that what the teacher says is OK. . ..BUT. . .Other kids sometimes think their own ideas are better\"). The Mastery and Judgment composites are included in the present study as in-dicators of motivational orientation in school.

Similarly, GPA and Achievement were manifest variables comprising the latent variable Academic Performance, and various direct measures of parenting were manifest variables comprising the broader latent parenting constructs. Whereas latent variables were theoretically determined, the manifest variables that made up each latent variable were included if they operationalized an important aspect of the latent variable, and if they were substantially correlated with one another. In all of the models, we used 2-headed arrows (to indicate bidirectionality) between latent variables measured during the same year, and single-headed arrows to link 5th-with 7th-grade variables.

On the other hand, consistent with a mediating effect, in the expanded models the coefficients for the direct path between 5th-grade academic performance and 7th-grade motivational orientation were greatly reduced, becoming nonsignificant in one case, and going from 0.56 to 0.22 in each of the others. In addition, the changes in R 2 between the original and expanded models were highly significant. These results suggest that children who do well in school in 5th-grade are likely to feel more academically competent, which over time may lead to their becoming more intrinsically motivated in their approach to learning and schoolwork in middle school.",

It also points to the possibility that the negative relation between extrinsic reward and achievement may have reflected some parents' attempts to improve the performance of 5th graders who were already doing poorly in school. This approach would be in keeping with clinical research that has found the use of contingency rewards to be effective in modifying children's problematic behaviors (McMahon and Wells, 1998) . However, when we computed the correlation between 5th-grade parental Extrinsic Reward and 7th grade GPA for children with GPA's below 3.0 (n = 31), it turned out to be similar to the correlation for the sample as a whole (\u22120.31 and \u22120.37 respectively), which suggests that rewards from parents did not tend to bring about improvement over time for low achieving children. Thus, whereas the use of contingency rewards have proven to be useful for modifying oppositional behavior in clinically referred children, the present findings do not show the same kind of beneficial effect on academic outcomes in a nonclinical sample. 5 .

However, the directionality of relations between any 2 variables measured at fairly close points in time can only be speculative, and in some cases, a convincing argument can be made for a bi-directionality of effects. For example, in the 5th-grade year, parents may have become more controlling and punitive about homework and grades if their children were doing poorly in school. Similarly, parents whose children were doing well may have responded with more autonomy-promoting behaviors in the 5th-grade year, as well as was seen over time in Fig. 3 . In regard to child outcomes, 5th graders who were more confident about their scholastic abilities may have put more effort into their schoolwork, so that they had higher grades and achievement scores. Likewise, a more intrinsic motivational orientation in 7th grade may have led children to put more effort into schoolwork, and thus achieve higher grades. Also, although the alternative models did not confirm the pathways from 5th-grade motivation to 7th-grade achievement, the correlations in Table II suggest that academic performance and intrinsic motivational orientation may be mutually reinforcing. It may be that children who do well in school tend to gain confidence and become more intrinsically motivated, as Harter and Connell (1984) concluded, and that greater intrinsic motivation tends to result in children becoming more invested in their schoolwork, which then may lead to a higher level of achievement, as has been suggested in previous research (Gottfried, 1990; Gottfried et al., 1994) .",

The implications of the current findings are that parents' everyday engagement with their children in ways that encourage independent thinking, problem-solving skills, and selfefficacy may serve to promote achievement and foster intrinsic motivation for academic work. Further, the use of externally controlling behaviors in regard to children's school learning, including pressure, coercion, and shaming as well as contingency rewards and punishment, may serve to impede the development of academic competence and lead to a more extrinsic motivational orientation in educational endeavors.",

Such research might also include a measure of children's perceived control over the causes of their academic successes and failures which, according to Harter and Connell, plays a key role in influencing children's academic performance. In addition, the relation between motivational orientation and school failure and dropout warrants further study, to see whether an intrinsic motivational orientation might in fact prevent adolescents from leaving school prematurely. From a methodological standpoint, additional perspectives on children's motivational orientation-such as teachers' observations-would help address the limitation of using only children's self-report measures for motivational orientation and perceived academic competence.",

Research on parenting in relation to adolescent school achievement and academic self-concept has revealed differences among ethnic groups; for example, several studies have found that authoritative parenting was advantageous for Caucasian but not Asian Americans students (Dornbusch et al., 1987; Steinberg et al., 1994) . In future research it will be impor-tant to examine whether these differences are also reflected in the developmental pathways to motivational orientation.",
