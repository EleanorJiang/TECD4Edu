Early adolescents in the sample showed significant changes in their adjustment following the transition, as indicated by their increased psychological distress or decreased academic achievement following the transition. Gender differences were found in adjustment changes over time, suggesting that boys and girls may be differentially affected by middle school transition. Different patterns of adjustment changes were explored by means of cluster analysis on the basis of psychological distress scores before and after the transition. Three distinct patterns were identified across genders, including (a) an average start but increasing to high pattern, (b) an initial low but increasing to moderately high pattern, and (c) a pattern of consistently high scores over time. The results are discussed in terms of individual differences among early adolescents in their adjustment to middle school transition. Implications for research and practice in school psychology also are elaborated.",

The contextual shift from elementary school to junior high school or middle school alters the ecology of the early adolescent through a change in both the school setting and the student role (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Fenzel, 1989) . Most children move from a relatively small, more personalized and task-focused elementary school environment to a larger, more departmentalized, impersonal and achievement-oriented middle or junior high school. In the new school, they face differences in grading practices, teacher expectations, and teacher-student relationships (Eccles & Midgley, 1990; Eccles et al., 1993; . Their social relationships, particularly peer relationships, are also affected by these transitions (Blyth, Hill, & Smith, 1981; Felner, Primavera, & Cauce, 1981; Hirsch & Rapkin, 1987) . This discontinu-ity in both school structure and social roles requires significant adaptive efforts from early adolescents, and, for some, these transitions can be stressful and challenging.",

These studies have provided convincing evidence on the potential stressfulness of the middle school transition, but the findings concerning coping and adaptation have been mixed. There appear to be large individual differences among early adolescents in their response to the middle school transition: some adolescents show significant negative changes following the transition, while others manifest no negative and sometimes even positive changes subsequent to the transition (Crockett et al., 1989; Fenzel & Blyth, 1986; Hirsch & Rapkin, 1987; Nottlemann, 1987; .

The specific aims of the present study are as follows: (a) to examine early adolescents' adjustment before and after middle school transition; (b) to examine gender differences among early adolescents in their adjustment patterns before and after middle school transition; (c) to identify subgroups of early adolescents who exhibit distinct patterns of adjustment changes during middle school transition on the basis of psychological distress before and after the transition; (d) to examine how these subgroups are differentiated in terms of their pre-and posttransition adjustment, measured by academic achievement, self-concept, school behavior, and social support; (e) to examine subgroup differences on the basis of their coping with adaptational tasks of middle school.",

School psychologists often encounter students with a range of adjustment difficulties related to school transition. While some students experience no or mild adjustment difficulties following the transition, other students undergo severe difficulties that may precipitate psychological crisis (Ingraham, 1985) . In order to provide effective services, it is important for school psychologists to understand different developmental patterns of students' adaptations. By examining different patterns of early adolescents' adaptations associated with middle school transitions, the present study will provide useful implications for school psychologists in identifying students at risk as well as in developing effective, developmentally appropriate intervention and prevention strategies for early adolescents making middle school transitions.",

The middle school was much larger, receiving students from three elementary schools. It was structured such that students had different subject area teachers and traveled across the building to those classes. In addition, the demands on students to take notes in class, keep track of assignments, and do homework were much greater than was the case in elementary school. The middle school also had an explicit code of conduct with detentions, versus a much more classroom-based discipline system in the elementary school.",

Because the psychological distress measure significantly changed over time among participants of both genders in the sample, Time 1 and Time 2 psychological distress scores were used as criterion variables for cluster analysis. Ward's method was employed to group adolescents into clusters so that the minimum variances within clusters were optimized. The 3-cluster solution was determined as the most probable solution for both genders by examining the value of the fusion coefficients. The conceptual meaningfulness of the clusters was also considered in determining the number of clusters to retain. The average Time 1 and Time 2 psychological distress scores of the three clusters are shown in Table 5 for boys. Cluster 1 (average to high) included 22 (44%) of the boys in the sample and was characterized by an average score at Time 1 and a high score at Time 2. Cluster 2 (low to moderately high), containing 20 (40%) of the adolescents, started with a low score at Time 1, but demonstrated a higher score at Time 2. Eight (16%) of the boys in the sample represented Cluster 3 (consistently high). These adolescents demonstrated consistently high scores across the time points. The accuracy of the clusters derived was examined by the percentage of correct classification with discriminant analysis. A total of 92.65% of the sample was correctly classified into the derived clusters, with the fit ranging from 95.45 to 87.50. Table 5 also presents the average Time 1 and Time 2 psychological distress scores of the clusters for girls. Cluster 1 (average to high) consisted of 15 (30.61%) of the girls in the sample and was characterized by an average score at Time 1 and a moderately high score at Time 2. Cluster 2 (low to moderately high) included 28 (57.14%) of the girls in the sample. These adolescents started with a low score at Time 1 but demonstrated a moderately high score at Time 2. Cluster 3 (consistently high) contained 6 (12.24%) of the girls in the sample and was characterized by consistently high scores across the time points. The accuracy of the clusters derived was examined by the percentage of correct classification. Discriminant analysis revealed that all girls in the sample were correctly classified into the derived clusters.",

However, inconsistent findings of the effect of school transition on early adolescents' self-esteem have been reported, partially due to variations of sample characteristics, different meth-odologies, and unmeasured differences in school environments. Therefore, previous findings of self-esteem changes in adolescents following the transition should be interpreted with caution. In the present study, the data were collected once each year in the spring, toward the end of the school year. It is not clear whether this finding would have been the same if the assessments had been conducted earlier in the school year, as is the case with most previous research. In fact, some researchers have argued that early adolescents' self-esteem decreases immediately after the school transition but gradually increases as they adjust to the school change (Nottlemann, 1987; Wigfield et al., 1991) . Therefore, the current finding may reflect a long-term effect rather than a short-term, immediate effect of school transition.",

In the present study, the results were obtained for predominantly White, working-class students in a suburban community. Specific results may differ for other samples with different characteristics. Second, as discussed earlier, necessarily small sample sizes for some clusters may attenuate findings of significant effects; it would be useful to replicate the results in larger and/or more varied samples. Third, it is possible that preexisting group differences in unmeasured variables may have confounded the observed differences between groups. Finally, the focus of this study was on examining individual differences in adaptation to middle school transition using multiple indices of adjustment. However, the range of indices used in the present study was not exhaustive of all important characteristics relevant to the transition. To develop a more comprehensive picture of adaptation to the transition, future research must incorporate a wider range of indices, including family-related variables and characteristics of various middle schools.",

Further, school psychology services often are organized so that different ''teams'' have responsibility for students before and after middle school, with transition issues getting little attention in the pressure of daily crisis management and accountability.",
