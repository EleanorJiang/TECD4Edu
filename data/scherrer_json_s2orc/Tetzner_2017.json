This study examined the relation between optimism and academic achievement in early adolescents. It investigated the functional form of this relation, addressed whether the initial achievement level moderates this association, and compared this with effects on self-esteem. Method: We used a large German sample (N 5 6,010; 53.2% females; baseline M age 5 14.1) with two measurement points over a period of 5 months (middle and end of 7th grade). Estimating LOESS curves and latent change-regression models revealed three main findings. Results: (a) Optimism showed a nonlinear association with subsequent changes in academic achievement: Optimism promoted academic achievement, but this positive association reached a plateau in above-average optimism ranges and a minimum value in below-average ranges of optimism. (b) The achievement level at t 1 moderated this relation so that high optimism exerted a more positive effect for high-achieving adolescents. (c) By contrast, optimism had an overall positive effect on self-esteem. Conclusions: The results therefore broaden the evidence on benefits of optimism by linking optimism to academic success in early adolescents but indicate only small and nonlinear associations.",

Optimists experience lower levels of distress, have better interpersonal relationships and physical health, and report better occupational outcomes and well-being (Carver, Scheier, & Segerstrom, 2010; Segerstrom, 2007) . However, previous studies that examined the effects of optimism on adolescents' academic achievement repeatedly failed to confirm these beneficial effects and for the most part found no longitudinal association (Rand, Martin, & Shea, 2011; Solberg Nes, Evans, & Segerstrom, 2009; Tetzner & Becker, 2015) . Instead, theoretical assumptions and empirical findings on the negative effects of optimism, especially of high levels of optimism (e.g., Dillard, Midboe, & Klein, 2009) have raised the question of whether strictly linear relations sufficiently reflect this association. Aiming to address this so far unexplored issue, the present study takes a closer look at the relation between optimism and subsequent changes in academic achievement using a prospective study of a large sample of German early adolescents. It examines whether the effect of optimism on academic achievement could be better described in nonlinear ways. Finally, we compare these associations with effects on adolescents' self-esteem.",

Whereas related constructs, such as hope and self-efficacy, primarily refer to thoughts about an individual's capability to control future outcomes, optimism also encompasses positive expectations about factors that lie outside his or her own control (Bandura, 2006; Rand, 2009) . These generalized positive expectations appear to help optimistic people to develop more positively in several areas of life. Optimism is associated with better adaptation to a broad range of stressful situations, such as educational transitions (Brissette, Scheier, & Carver, 2002) , the death or serious illness of a spouse (Kivim\u20ac aki et al., 2005) , and daily stressors (Robinson & Liu, 2013) . Optimism is also linked to success in multiple domains, such as higher well-being (Scheier & Carver, 1992) , better occupational outcomes (Segerstrom, 2007) , and better physical health (Rasmussen, Scheier, & Greenhouse, 2009) .",

The majority of previous research used adult samples, and the developmental significance of optimism in adolescence received little attention (Oberle et al., 2011) . Other studies used cross-sectional designs and investigated domain-specific indicators rather than dispositional optimism, or they examined effects on self-perceived rather than actual academic success. To the best of our knowledge, very few studies have used longitudinal data to examine the influence of dispositional optimism on academic achievement in adolescent or emerging adult samples. The studies that did do this found no association for the most part. A study that investigated whether optimism helps 7th-grade students cope with their parents' separation found no general association between dispositional optimism and subsequent developmental changes for either academic achievement or self-esteem (Tetzner & Becker, 2015) . Looking at college students, Solberg Nes et al. (2009) found that dispositional optimism was associated with higher motivation, lower distress, and a lower chance of dropping out of college. However, optimism did not predict students' grade point averages in that study. Studies by Rand and colleagues also found no association between optimism and subsequent academic performance (law school GPA) in first-year law students (Rand et al., 2011) , but they indicated that a common factor of hope and optimism predicted their class grades, even after controlling for high school GPA (Rand, 2009) .",

However, there are related lines of research that can inform us in developing our hypotheses. One explanation may be that optimism has general unbeneficial effects on developmental outcomes. Research on positive thinking has indicated that positive thoughts and images about the future are associated with a lower likelihood of positive outcomes across a variety of contexts, including achievement-related outcomes (see Oettingen, 2012) . For example, Sevincer, Wagner, Kalvelage, and Oettingen (2014) found that positive thoughts about the future in U.S. presidential inaugural addresses predicted economic declines in subsequent presidential tenures. Similarly, students with positive thoughts about an upcoming exam appear to achieve lower course grades than other students (Oettingen & Mayer, 2002) . Therefore, the negative consequences of positive thinking may also hold for early adolescents' academic achievement. However, past research has focused conceptually on positive thoughts and images about the future rather than on positive general future expectations (cf. Oettingen & Mayer, 2002) .

Therefore, both the beneficial and detrimental effects of optimism may affect academic development. The well-documented phenomenon of \"unrealistic optimism,\" which relates to the tendency to have more favorable future expectations than suggested by an objective standard (Shepperd, Waters, Weinstein, & Klein, 2015; Weinstein, 1980) , indicates that only an especially high level of optimism may be associated with negative outcomes (see Shepperd et al., 2015) . For example, Dillard and colleagues (2009) examined the alcohol consumption of college students and asked them about their expectations regarding negative alcohol-related events in the future. Students with unrealistically optimistic expectations (i.e., those who underrated their own probability of having negative experiences in relation to their actual alcohol consumption) were more likely to experience alcohol-related problems during the next 2 years than their counterparts with realistic or pessimistic expectations. Applying these assumptions to the effects of optimism on academic achievement, we may expect a curvilinear association. Optimists' attentional bias to positive information may generally promote academic development among early adolescents by causing higher persistence and academic engagement (see Carver et al., 2010; Solberg Nes & Segerstrom, 2006) . But when there is particularly high optimism, the attentional bias may hinder them from noticing threats and identifying challenges that require additional effort, thus impairing early adolescents' academic success (Isaacowitz, 2005; Segerstrom, 2001 ).",

It is thus debatable whether these results are transferable to dispositional optimism as a more global personality trait. Nevertheless, previous research on personality-performance relationships has provided some initial hints regarding nonlinear associations with personality traits. For instance, Cucina and Vasilopoulos (2005) investigated the relation between the Big Five personality traits and academic performance in college students and found a curvilinear relationship for Conscientiousness.

Research on unrealistic optimism has indicated that optimism only exerts detrimental effects when the individual expectations are too positive, that is, unrealistic (see Dillard et al., 2009) . To distinguish unrealistic expectations from merely optimistic expectations, it is necessary to consider the basis upon which people decide that there is reason for optimism (see Tennen & Affleck, 1987) . In this regard, it should be considered that although dispositional optimism is generally assumed to be stable, it is also shaped by individual experiences (Atienza, Stephens, & Townsend, 2004; Segerstrom, 2007) . For instance, growing up in socioeconomically advantaged households is associated with optimism in adulthood (Heinonen et al., 2006; Korkeila et al., 2004) . Thus, highly optimistic people may differ in whether they have reasons to expect positive outcomes in their futures because they may differ in the resources that may help them to reach their goals. In the case of early adolescents' academic achievement, the effects of optimism may depend on individual academic potential. For a high-achieving student, a high level of optimism may represent a well-grounded future expectation and boost his or her further academic development. Conversely, the same level of optimism may be unrealistically high for a previously low-achieving student and may impede his or her academic development. To date, no previous study has investigated whether individual differences in the availability of resources moderate the effects of dispositional optimism on academic achievement.",

Empirical findings indicated that the factors that help individuals cope with stressful situations or challenging life periods may differ in how they influence various areas of adaptation. Therefore, an especially high level of optimism could impede adolescents' academic achievement but promote their self-esteem. To that effect, motivational theories indicate that high optimism may prevent declines in positive self-perception and well-being (see the hedonic contingency model, Wegener & Petty, 1994 ; see also socioemotional selectivity theory, Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999) . These theories state that an attentional bias toward positive stimuli may be grounded in an underlying motivation to achieve and maintain positive affect and well-being (Isaacowitz, 2006) . Although early adolescents with a high level of optimism may be more likely to fail academically, their focus on positive information and their own strengths may prevent declines in their self-esteem.",

We further allowed for cross- sectional correlations between the intercept of optimism and the intercept of academic achievement and between their slopes. Second, we tested for nonlinear effects of optimism on academic achievement (Table 2, Model 2). To this end, we estimated latent interaction terms for quadratic and cubic terms of optimism at t 1 and added them to the model as predictors for mean-level changes in academic achievement. We estimated a third model to investigate whether the initial level of academic achievement moderates the association between optimism and subsequent changes in academic achievement (Aim 2). Therefore, we estimated latent interaction terms of academic achievement and optimism at t 1 (as well as the quadratic term) and included them in our model as additional predictors for mean-level changes in academic achievement (Table 2, Model 3; see Figure 1 ). To the best of our knowledge, Mplus does not allow for the estimation of overall model fit indices for analyses that include latent interactions (e.g., Klein & Moosbrugger, 2000) .

LOESS curves are nonparametric and provide a graphical tool for depicting the shape of a bivariate association using local regression techniques. The statistical procedure therefore splits the values of the independent variable (optimism) into smaller subsets, uses them to compute multiple regression lines, and, finally, combines these lines into a smoothed curve. Since LOESS curves are obtained empirically rather than by using a specific statistical model (e.g., linear, quadratic), they can reveal complex relationships between variables that may be overlooked when using other statistical techniques (Jacoby, 2000) .

We residualized the mean-level changes in academic achievement for the initial level of academic achievement. We then estimated a second graph to further examine the moderating effect of initial academic achievement (Aim 2). To plot this interaction effect, we divided our sample into three groups, separated by their academic achievement at t 1 (average 5 between 1 SD above and 1 SD below the average academic achievement, below average 5 more than 1 SD below the average, above average 5 more than 1 SD above the average). We group-centered the mean-level changes in academic achievement. We estimated additional LOESS curves to determine whether we could find similar associations for self-esteem (Aim 3). We used the same procedure described for academic achievement. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics and correlations for the study variables, which indicate positive associations between optimism and academic achievement as well as between optimism and self-esteem within and across time. To examine these associations more comprehensively, in the following sections we report our results from structural equation modeling and from estimating LOESS curves.

Although the reverse relation is not a focus of our study, the results suggested that academic achievement at t 1 predicted subsequent meanlevel changes in optimism, which indicated that the individual level of optimism may increase following academic success. Our second model (see Table 2 , Model 2) tested whether optimism at t 1 predicts subsequent mean-level changes in academic achievement in a nonlinear way. The results supported our assumption of nonlinearity because they indicate a curvilinear association. Optimism predicted mean-level changes in academic achievement in terms of small cubic effects (linear effect: b 5 .08, p < .001; quadratic effect: b 5 -.05, p < .001; cubic effect: b 5 -.03, p < .001), indicating a positive association with turning points toward less favorable effects.

Confirming the results of the latent change-regression model, the curve followed a curvilinear pattern. Scores in the middle range of optimism (in the range between 1 SD below and 1 SD above the average optimism in our sample) were positively related to meanlevel changes in academic achievement. In the aboveaverage range, the enhancing effects of optimism on further academic achievement seemed to reach a plateau. However, the curve indicated no detrimental effects of above-average optimism. In the below-average range, the effects of optimism seemed to converge to a minimum value. Since our latent change-regression models indicated that the initial achievement level may moderate the effects of optimism on academic achievement, we estimated additional LOESS curves to depict this interaction effect (Aim 2). Figure 2 , Graph 1B therefore plots this association once more, showing groups of different achievement levels at t 1 (average vs. above average vs. below average). Confirming a moderating influence, the curves indicated more pronounced effects of optimism in adolescents whose initial achievement was average or above average rather than below average. In line with our hypotheses, the point at which higher optimism no longer boosted academic achievement seemed to vary between achievement groups. Above-average optimism seemed to be additionally beneficial for academic achievement among adolescents with aboveaverage initial achievement, but not for early adolescents with below-average initial achievement.",

At aboveaverage levels of optimism, the positive effects on academic achievement reached a plateau. This finding of a negative quadratic effect is consistent with theoretical assumptions about the drawbacks of optimism (e.g., Isaacowitz, 2005) and research on unrealistic optimism (e.g., Shepperd et al., 2015) . Highly optimistic adolescents may see the world through rose-colored glasses. This attentional bias may hinder them from dealing with setbacks and challenges adequately, for example, by taking private lessons or investing more effort in homework. However, the findings do not support the assumption that above-average levels of optimism impair academic achievement. One possible explanation is that the potentially detrimental effects of high optimism, such as ignoring threats and failures (e.g., Isaacowitz, 2005) , may not apply within the school context because in such educational settings, students receive frequent feedback that Note. S-E 5 self-esteem; Opt 5 optimism. Model parameters were standardized relative to the first measurement. (The mean of the latent factors at t 1 were constrained to 0, and the variance was fixed to 1.) they cannot ignore. Another possible explanation is that high optimism may have detrimental effects, but that these detrimental effects may simply be counterbalanced by the positive effects of high optimism (i.e., the negative effects may prevent further increases in engagement and effort; Carver et al., 2010; Solberg Nes & Segerstrom, 2006) . This simultaneity of mechanisms that promote academic achievement and mechanisms that hinder academic achievement may result in an unchanged association for those with above-average levels of optimism. Notably, our results also indicated that the effects of optimism on adolescents' academic achievement converge to a minimum value in those with below-average levels of optimism. This finding of a cubic association hints at a complex relationship between optimism and academic achievement. Therefore, only mid-level optimism appears to be necessary to promote adolescents' success at school. In contrast, both the positive and the detrimental effects of extreme levels of optimism seem to reach limits.",

Although this relatively small contribution may contrast with ideas about the crucial role of optimism in guiding human thoughts and behavior (cf.

First, we measured academic achievement using standardized achievement test scores that were highly stable between the middle and end of 7th grade. This measure might have provided few opportunities for the influence of psychosocial factors such as optimism. Second, even if the effects were small over a period of 5 months, these influences may accumulate over time to have a meaningful impact on educational success across the life span.",

Drawing on research on unrealistic optimism (e.g., Dillard et al., 2009) , we predicted that high optimism may have more pronounced negative effects in adolescents with lower academic achievement. Our results confirmed this assumption. The positive effects of optimism on academic achievement seemed to be greater for average and high-achieving students than for their lower-achieving peers. For high-achieving students, the range of optimism that exerted a positive effect and the point at which this positive effect reached its limit appeared to be located in higher optimism scores than was the case for their lower-achieving peers. These results indicated that the effects of optimism vary as a function of the fit between expectations and individual aptitude. Optimism may only exert a positive influence when early adolescents also have useful academic skills that boost their further academic achievement. In general, this finding provides evidence that the availability of resources and skills may influence the kind and strength of the effects of optimism. Therefore, it may be useful to consider the individual foundation of positive expectations in the research on dispositional optimism.",

We tested this for self-esteem in early adolescents. Drawing on motivational theories (e.g., Isaacowitz, 2006) , we expected to find that optimism exerts significant beneficial effects on early adolescents' self-esteem. In line with our assumptions and contrary to effects on academic achievement, optimism appeared to have a positive linear effect on selfesteem. As with the relation between optimism and academic achievement, a nonlinear relation seemed to describe this association better, but the positive effect seemed to hold for the whole range of optimism scores. One possible explanation is that optimists' attentional bias toward positive information may help them to focus more on their personal strengths and less on setbacks, thereby protecting their self-esteem (cf. Isaacowitz, 2006) . These results are also in keeping with general assumptions about the crucial role of optimism for success in multiple areas of life (e.g., Carver et al., 2010) and with empirical findings regarding its positive association with mental health indicators (e.g., Rand et al., 2011) . Whether early adolescents had high or low self-esteem did not influence optimism effects. Therefore, the effects of optimism on self-esteem in early adolescents may be somewhat different from the effects of optimism on their academic achievement. Our findings thus highlight the need to examine the effects of optimism on different developmental domains separately.",

For example, \"getting good grades\" may be a more precise goal for early adolescents than \"being high-achieving,\" potentially leading to more specific actions to achieve better grades (e.g., preparing intensively for a test vs. preparing each day for school).

In our study, the particularly young age of the participants and the extensive and fundamental challenges and changes during early adolescence (e.g., 7th grade is the first school year of secondary schooling in some federal states in Germany) may additionally contribute to the low stability.

In the case of academic achievement, this positive association reached a plateau in above-average optimism ranges and a minimum value in belowaverage optimism ranges. For self-esteem, we found a positive linear association. The results therefore highlight the necessity of investigating developmental associations more thoroughly by accounting for nonlinearity in relations. They also underscore the need to specifically investigate the effects of optimism and the underlying mechanisms for different outcomes and to consider the fit between optimistic expectations and individual resources. Although the findings indicated that optimism matters for early adolescents' development, they also suggested that optimism only makes a small contribution to explaining why some early adolescents develop more positively in terms of academic achievement than others. Being optimistic may therefore help early adolescents cope with this challenging life period, but it does not seem to be a \"key\" that fosters positive development in all areas.",
