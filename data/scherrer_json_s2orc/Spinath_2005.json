As the main aim of schools is to prepare children for a successful mastery of future challenges, teachers are expected not only to convey knowledge, but also to foster a sustained learning motivation. It is important for teachers to be aware of this necessity and to possess both the knowledge and means with which to enhance students' learning motivation. Many teachers do not feel well prepared for this task due to a lack of professional knowledge about motivation, its development, and strategies for boosting it.",

Together, researchers and teachers developed and examined hypotheses about the beginning decline of learning motivation in elementary school, which has been noted in previous research (e.g., Bouffard, Marcoux, Vezeau, & Bordeleau, 2003; Gottfried, Fleming, & Gottfried, 2001; Harter, 1981; Meece & Miller, 2001; Wigfield et al., 1997) . The present paper first establishes the term learning motivation, which we consider to be at the core of motivational constructs from different research traditions. Second, we focus on the hypothesis that the decline in learning motivation during the first school years might be causally linked to the parallel decline in pupils' competence beliefs.",

The motor for this desire has been described as competence or effectance motivation (Harter, 1978; White, 1959) , a kind of motivation that is directed towards and satisfied by a feeling of efficacy (White, 1959, p. 322) . From the point of view of effectance motivation theory, individuals do not engage in a task because they want to learn something, but because they want to experience the feeling of efficacy, i.e. they want to feel competent. Since this feeling is only derived from moderately new tasks, individuals are unconsciously directed towards new learning experiences. Therefore, according to this approach, learning progress comes about as a by-product of engaging in enjoyable tasks. Individuals who enjoy tasks that bear potential learning experiences are considered to be motivated to learn. In modern motivation theories, this conception of learning motivation corresponds to the concept of intrinsic motivation (Deci & Ryan, 1985) or interest/intrinsic task values (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . The concepts of intrinsic motivation and interest converge in the notion that an individual is attracted to a task for reasons that lie within the task itself and that task engagement evokes positive affects regardless of future consequences.",

                "text": "Although there is ample evidence of a decline in learning motivation throughout elementary and middle school, the factors underlying this development are not well understood at this time. One assumption that can be derived from effectance motivation theory, and which was held by many teachers in our project, is that learning motivation is connected to children's competence beliefs: Children should be motivated to learn to the extent that they feel competent, i.e. believe in their abilities (White, 1959 ; see also Bandura, 1993; Eccles & Wigfield, 1995) . It is consistently reported that many young children view their abilities very optimistically and that this optimism is not easily shaken in the face of failure (cf. Stipek & MacIver, 1989) . Over the course of elementary school and beyond, children form increasingly realistic and therefore in most cases less positive self-perceptions of ability (e.g., Newman, 1984; Stipek & Daniels, 1988; Wigfield et al., 1997) . Thus, the general decline in learning motivation over the first school years is paralleled by a decline in competence beliefs. Moreover, several studies indicate a substantial positive association between concurrently measured intrinsic motivation (e.g., Deci & Ryan, 1985; Harter, 1981) or interest values (e.g., Eccles & Wigfield, 1995; Wigfield et al., 1997) and competence beliefs. The largest longitudinal study pertaining to these constructs, the Michigan Childhood and Beyond Longitudinal Project initiated by Eccles and her associates, provided evidence for increasing associations between intrinsic values and competence beliefs from grade 1 to grade 6 (Wigfield et al., 1997) . Similarly, Obach (2003) found substantial correlations between pupils' concurrently measured mastery goals and competence beliefs, which became stronger between grade 5 and grade 7. Surprisingly, few studies have tried to provide evidence for the hypothesized causal link between competence beliefs and learning motivation. In a study with a relatively small sample, Obach (2003) found that pupils' school-related competence beliefs were not predictive of mastery goals one year later when controlling for initial mastery goals. Another longitudinal study, in which the motivational measure encompassed interest/liking and investment in a certain domain, also found no evidence for a causal link between prior competence beliefs and subsequent motivation (Skaalvik & Valas, 1999) . In a similar vein, a recent study by Nurmi and Aunola (2005) , which focused on intrinsic task values as a motivational measure, found no conclusive evidence for causal determination of intrinsic task values through competence beliefs. Contrary to this, a study using the Michigan Childhood and Beyond Longitudinal Sample (Jacobs et al., 2003) concluded that students' competence beliefs explain substantial variance in the change of values over time. One reason for the diverging results of this latter study might be sought in the motivational measure that the researchers used, which differs markedly from the concept of learning motivation. Whereas learning motivation includes only intrinsic motivation and learning goals, Jacobs et al. used a composite score that combined interest values with importance and utility values, both of which would rather be part of the 'performance' factor of motivation proposed by Marsh et al. (2003) . Other than this, we are not aware of any studies that have investigated the possible causal link between school-related competence beliefs and learning motivation in a longitudinal classroom study. Given the scarce and in part inconsistent results of the existing studies, further studies are needed to shed light on the subject.",

To identify the model, several constraints were applied, including the equation of autoregression estimates for each construct (a and b), cross-lagged causation from one variable to the other (c and d) and reciprocal causation at each measurement occasion (e and f). This model also allows for the testing of series of nested submodels, i.e. submodels that are completely included in the full model and are fitted by constraining paths from the full model, thus gaining additional degrees of freedom. Typically, a more parsimonious variant is preferred if the reduced model does not lead to a significant deterioration in fit (Neale & Cardon, 1992) . Differences in fit between nested models can be tested by means of likelihood ratio tests (LRT). In the model depicted in Fig. 1b (Correlational Model) , cross-lagged causal paths were omitted and reciprocal causation at each measurement occasion was replaced by correlations. This model does not assume any causal effect between learning motivation and competence beliefs and it was devised as an alternative to the causal model. Within the correlational model, a variant that fixes the correlations between learning motivation and competence beliefs to be equal across age can be compared to a model that allows these correlations to vary. Because the correlational model is not nested within the causal model, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was used to compare the two models (Akaike, 1987) , with more negative AIC values indicating better fit.",

This finding is in line with previous research and adds to our knowledge about developmental trends that seem to be universal across a variety of culturally different classroom contexts (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Bouffard et al., 2003; Gottfried et al., 2001; Meece & Miller, 2001; Midgley et al., 1995; Newman, 1984; Stipek & Daniels, 1988; Stipek & MacIver, 1989; Wigfield et al., 1997) . A closer look at the evidence of decreasing motivation and competence beliefs reveals that these trends take different courses for boys and girls as well as for different school subjects (e.g., Wigfield et al., 1997) , and that the onset of the decline does not always fall within the first two school years (Nurmi & Aunola, 2005) . But even in the face of such differences, the overall picture of declining general school-related motivation and competence beliefs throughout elementary school and beyond is very clear. It is therefore particularly important to investigate the processes underlying these changes. A clearer understanding of the corresponding causes and effects will finally help us to understand to what extent the decline in learning motivation and competence beliefs are inevitable developmental phenomena and to what extent they can be influenced by characteristics of the educational setting.",

Specifically, the longitudinal development of four cohorts of first to fourth graders was best represented by a statistical model that predicts children's competence beliefs and learning motivation (a) to be substantially stable in terms of interindividual differences, (b) to be moderately to highly intercorrelated with each other, and (c) to have no causal influences on one another. Compared to previous studies, the interindividual stability as well as the concurrent intercorrelations of the two constructs is relatively high in the present study. Correlations of such magnitude are usually found in children at the end of elementary school or at the transition to middle school (e.g., Obach, 2003; Skaalvik & Valas, 1999) , whereas in the first years of elementary school these associations tend to be weak to moderate (as reported for the Michigan Childhood and Beyond Study by Wigfield et al., 1997) . The higher correlations in the present study could in part be due to the general school-related measures we used in comparison to the domain-specific measures used, for instance, in the Michigan Longitudinal Study. For example, considerable interindividual stability can be observed among children in grades 1 and 2 when looking at motivational patterns across different domains rather than focusing on one domain (Nurmi & Aunola, 2005) . A second reason for stronger associations reported in the present study is that the correlations are predictions derived from our statistical model, which tend to be somewhat higher than the first-order correlations.",

                "text": "Although moderate to strong concurrent correlations between learning motivation and competence beliefs might suggest causal influences between the two constructs, the present data provide no evidence for such mechanisms. This is especially important, because many prominent motivation theories include, more or less explicitly, the assumption of causal links between learning motivation and competence beliefs (e.g., Deci & Ryan, 1985; Eccles & Wigfield, 1995; Harter, 1978; White, 1959) . The present findings do not rule out the possibility of some causal influences between competence beliefs and learning motivation, but they do indicate that these influences would be rather small. Further studies would benefit from taking a closer look at variables that might either influence both competence beliefs and learning motivation, or function as moderators of the association between the two. For example, the predominance of either a social or an individual norm of reference (Rheinberg, Duscha, & Michels, 1980) might moderate the strength of association between learning motivation and competence beliefs. In a learning environment with a predominant social norm of reference, both competence beliefs and learning motivation rely strongly on perceptions of abilities relative to others. Normative ability feedback, as conveyed by grades, competitions, or simply comparing pupils' achievements with one another, is likely to engender both high competence beliefs and strong feelings of efficacy, i.e. learning motivation, in children with high abilities relative to others, whereas children with low abilities are likely to end up with low competence beliefs and few reasons for feelings of efficacy under such feedback conditions. Opposed to this, in a learning environment with a predominant individual norm of reference, children can experience feelings of efficacy independently of their ability relative to others. Because an individual norm of reference defines success in terms of individual learning progress, all children have the opportunity to feel efficient independently of their ability relative to their classmates. Therefore, competence beliefs and learning motivation should be more closely associated in a learning environment where a social norm of reference prevails compared to settings with a prevailing individual norm of reference. As the emphasis on normative feedback and performance outcomes instead of learning goals usually increases after elementary school (e.g., Midgley et al., 1995; cf. Eccles, Midgley, & Adler, 1984) , a causal link between competence beliefs and learning motivation is more likely to be found in middle school than in elementary school.",

(2003) reported that students' competence beliefs in mathematics, language arts, and sports explain substantial variance in the change in domain-specific task values over time. Contrary to this, Skaalvik & Valas (1999) failed to demonstrate causal associations between domain-specific competence beliefs and motivational measures in mathematics and language arts. Such inconsistent results may also in part be due to different methodological approaches, which can be more or less sensitive for detecting causality. Altogether, future studies are needed to investigate domainspecific learning motivation and competence beliefs with different methodological approaches.",

Many teachers in our project held the assumption that declining learning motivation was an inevitable consequence of children's increasingly realistic self-perceptions. Some teachers even reported practices meant to preserve these overoptimistic selfperceptions by giving either unrealistically positive or imprecise feedback. In light of the current research findings, teachers should be guided to reconsider their implicit theories about the maintenance and enhancement of pupils' learning motivation and to change their feedback practices. Feedback practices meant to preserve unrealistic self-perception are likely not only to fail to foster children's learning motivation but also to hamper learning progress. Unrealistic or lack of feedback sets children up for future failure experiences. Instead, only if children are able to evaluate their abilities realistically they are able to choose adequate tasks and perceive their own learning progress. This, in return, is likely to foster children's actual abilities and positive selfevaluations.",

An optimistic, motivationally beneficial attitude towards learning is largely independent of the absolute level of ability the individual possesses at a given moment.",

If the decline of children's learning motivation throughout elementary school and beyond is not an inevitable consequence of declining competence beliefs, then it might be possible to disentangle the developmental curves of the two constructs.
