                "text": "Inter-individual differences in development of global self-esteem Huang (2010) proposed that global self-esteem may change when people are going through changes in their lives, and that global self-esteem may increase when people succeed in confronting the developmental challenges of maturation and environmental changes in adolescence. According to the self-determination theory (Ryan & Brown, 2006) , genuine and true global self-esteem develops as a result of the satisfaction of three fundamental human needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Need satisfaction is dependent on a supportive environment that provides the appropriate opportunities. It is likely that for most adolescents, the support provided by significant others, in particular their families, is quite high and stable during adolescence. Thus, their global self-esteem may also be high and stable during this age period (Huang, 2010) . However, some individuals may not receive the support they need, thereby disabling them to confront developmental challenges in an appropriate way. These adolescents may experience a trajectory of decreasing global self-esteem into adulthood. Block and Robins (1993) noted that although they found no age differences in the mean levels of global self-esteem during adolescence, about 60% of the participants showed either an increase or a decrease in global self-esteem of at least one standard deviation. Baldwin and Hoffman (2002) used growth curve modelling to estimate intra-individual changes in global self-esteem from early adolescence (age 11 years) to young adulthood (age 21 years). They found that the mean level of global self-esteem changed in a non-linear way during adolescence, and that these changes varied significantly among individuals. Furthermore, a three-wave longitudinal study focusing on young adulthood (ages 23-28 years) found few normative changes but consistent evidence of individual differences in these changes (Donnellan, Trzesniewski, Conger, & Conger, 2007) . This indicates that there are considerable individual differences in development of self-esteem during adolescence. Hirsch and DuBois (1991) analyzed longitudinal data from 128 American adolescents in grades 7-9 (aged 12-14 years). Global self-esteem was measured at four points in time within two years, and cluster analysis extracted a four-class solution. They designated the classes \"consistently high\" (35%), \"chronically low\" (13%), \"steeply declining\" (21%), and \"small increase\" (31%). Zimmerman, Copeland, Shope, and Dielman (1997) replicated this study with 1160 American adolescents from the sixth to the tenth grades (aged 11-15) and identified four trajectories: \"consistently high\" (48%), \"moderate and rising\" (19%), \"steadily decreasing\" (20%), and \"consistently low\" (13%). In the study by Deihl, Vicary, and Deike (1997) of American adolescents in grades 7-10 (aged 12-15 years), three distinct trajectories were identified: \"consistently high\" (47%), \"small increase\" (37%), and \"chronically low\" (16%). These studies examined relatively short time periods and identified changes over only 2-4 years during early adolescence. These studies are all cluster analysis, which divides data sets into multiple partitions either by maximizing between-group variance or by minimizing within-group variance (similar to factor analysis).",

Global self-esteem and life satisfaction show correlations in the range of 0.40-0.60 (Gilman & Huebner, 2003) . Another global measure of psychological adjustment is depressive symptoms. In a study of two samples of adolescents between the ages of 15 and 21 years and 18 and 21 years, low global self-esteem predicted subsequent levels of depression, but depression did not predict subsequent levels of global self-esteem (Orth, Robins, & Roberts, 2008) .",

Cluster analysis and newer methods such as latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and growth mixture modelling (GMM) may be used for these purposes. LCGA estimates mean growth curves of a given number of classes, where no individual variation around the mean growth curves is allowed. To allow for more flexibility, Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n (2000) proposed GMM, which combined features of LGM and LCGA. GMM estimates mean growth curves for each class and permits individual variation around these growth curves. Cluster analysis, LCGA and GMM have all been criticized for being a structure-imposing rather than structure-seeking procedure and because the extracted sub-groups are not necessarily discrete (Beauchaine & Marsh, 2006) . Heterogeneity in the sample does not necessarily indicate presence of sub-populations (Bauer, 2007) . In GMM, it is assumed that 1) the observed distribution is non-normal, and consists of a finite mixture of unobserved non-identical distributions, and 2) the unobserved distribution has a known distributional form (e.g. normal distribution). If either or both these assumptions are not met, the number of classes may be over-extracted. These assumptions are important to keep in mind when searching for true and qualitatively different classes of development. However, there are different ways to interpret the extracted classes. The different classes may also be viewed as approximations of distributions, as a way to depict and describe some of the most typical developmental trajectories within a continuum without stating that these are qualitatively different classes (Johnson, Hicks, McGue, & Iacono, 2007) . These models may be seen as summaries of the data with classes that do not have to correspond to psychologically meaningful categories that are qualitatively different. It is likely that developmental trajectories of global self-esteem are fairly continuous in nature, and that the boundaries between them are fuzzy. The use of GMM to detect developmental groupings is in this case a systematic approach to explore the nature and extent of heterogeneity in developmental patterns experienced by the majority of people. It is a comprehensible way to sort various developmental experiences into different types, which may shed new light on typical trajectories and predictors and consequences of them. In the present study, GMM is used to describe distinct developmental patterns in global self-esteem from age 14-23 years. The validity and number of the trajectory classes were determined by examining the available indicators of goodness of fit. Furthermore, each individual was assigned to the latent class with the developmental profile that best fitted their trajectory.",

Table 3 shows the sizes and specifications of the one-and three-class solutions. The last and very important criterion in selecting a model is whether it makes theoretical sense and shows the classes to have qualitatively different trajectories. Because the three classes are indeed different, both at the baseline level of global self-esteem and in their trajectories, this criterion is considered to be fulfilled. Fig. 1 show the observed mean developments of global self-esteem from 14 years to 23 years for the three classes. 87% of the sample fitted best a consistently high and somewhat increasing trajectory of global self-esteem, 5.5% fitted best a chronically low and somewhat decreasing trajectory of global self-esteem, whereas 7.5% fitted best a U-shaped trajectory which seems to have a turning point at age 18.",

The second discriminative function did not show significant association with the predictors. The significant function is displayed in Table  6 and, as can be seen, the most powerful discriminators are body image and relations with parents.

However, these classes are still considerably smaller than the 87% found in the present study. The main reason for this may be that in the earlier studies, global self-esteem was measured over a time-span of 2-4 years and only in early adolescence, from about 11 to 15 years of age. The present study had a broader scope, and because its duration was longer and the number of measurements higher, certain differences from the other studies should be expected.",

Because of the short time-spans evaluated, none of the previous studies of global selfesteem development in sub-groups had the opportunity to identify a U-shaped developmental trajectory. These individuals may have experienced a period of lower support, need satisfaction and coping during adolescence. This class has their lowest level of self-esteem in late adolescence around age 18. Previous findings regarding drop in self-esteem in adolescence appear to be particularly robust, but there is a lack of consensus about at what age the lowest scores are reported. The present study replicated the findings of Robins et al. (2002) , which provided data on self-esteem from childhood through adulthood and found declining scores during adolescence with the lowest mean score reported in the group of young adults (ages 18-22), followed by a gradual rise in adulthood. It is possible that this class of adolescents may experience increasing problems threatening their self esteem at high school (12-5), and even more increasing problems at secondary high school (16) (17) (18) (19) . At 19, about half of Norwegian adolescents quit school and start working, as well as moving out from their parent's home. Such life transitions offer new opportunities that may contribute to an increase in self esteem, for example by enabling adolescents to choose a job that they like and master, as well as feeling better about themselves because they can make their own living arrangements.

This finding indicates that even when there was an improvement in the way the individuals in the U-shaped class evaluated themselves in their early twenties, by age 30, they still experienced more negative outcomes than those in the consistently high global self-esteem class. In addition, all classes scored significantly differently on depressed mood. A possible implication is that a U-shaped trajectory of global self-esteem during adolescence may have long-term effects. This assumption is consistent with the \"scar\" hypothesis (Rohde, Lewinsohn, & Seeley, 1994) , which proposes that during a period of depression and low global self-esteem, individuals acquire characteristics that persist after the period of low global self-esteem has passed. Furthermore, the class with chronically low global self-esteem reported significantly higher levels of insomnia than those in the consistently high and U-shaped classes. Perhaps there is a dose-response relationship between number of years with low global self-esteem and mental distress such as high levels of depressed mood, high levels of insomnia and low levels of life satisfaction. Orth et al. (2008) asserted that low global self-esteem is a risk factor for development of depression, especially in the face of major life stressors.",

Perhaps there are no differences at age 13, and that the adolescents following the U-shaped trajectory subsequently may experience difficult life events (such as school-related problems) that culminate upon leaving school at age 18-19. Another explanation may be that there may be differences in other characteristics that are not measured in the present study. Some individuals (e.g. those in the U-shaped class) may have a vulnerability that reveals itself when they confront changes and difficult developmental challenges. This is in line with Kernis' theory about fragile global self-esteem (2003) , which posits that there are two qualitatively different types of global high self-esteem; stable high global self-esteem and unstable high global self-esteem. Unstable global self-esteem that fluctuates in line with positive and negative experiences will make individuals vulnerable to threats, while individuals with stable high global self-esteem will be more resistant to the effects of negative events and failures. Originally, Kernis conceptualized this theory for short-term fluctuations in self-esteem, but it may also be relevant with long-term fluctuations that may come as consequences of the physical, psychological, and contextual changes during this age period.",

These exploratory model estimation algorithms seek to find the best representation of the data, given the specifications of the models. This means that the specifications of the models must be considered, with adherence to the predictions of the theory and of common sense. Moreover, when the GMM is used in studies of class differences, it is important to acknowledge that the class memberships are based on the most probable class memberships. Also, the small class sizes of the chronically low and Ushaped trajectories should be noted when interpreting the results.",

However, one has to be careful when interpreting the extracted classes. In this study, the classes are interpreted as a way to allow data reduction and describe development, and not as qualitatively distinct classes. About 7% of adolescents appear to experience a period of low global self-esteem and seem to carry scars into adulthood. A class of 6% of adolescents also seems to have chronic problems related to their global self-esteem. Determining the predictors of these problems may allow these individuals to be identified and provided with support that can help them into a more positive developmental trajectory.",
