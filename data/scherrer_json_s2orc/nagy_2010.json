The development of children's and adolescents' academic self-views is thus of great interest to researchers working in the framework of these theories. Various labels have been used to describe competence self-perceptions (e.g., Pedhazur & Schmelkin, 1991) ; in this article, we use the term ''academic self-concept'' (or simply ''self-concept''). The domain-specific academic self-concept reflects an individual's evaluation of his or her ability in a specific domain or academic area. It is usually assessed via self-report measures. Typical self-concept items are ''I am quite good at mathematics'' (mathematics self-concept) and ''I have a poor vocabulary'' (verbal self-concept). Domain-specific academic self-concepts are characterized by rather descriptive self-evaluations (compared with the more affective self-evaluations used in global self-esteem or interest measures).",

The literature offers two competing theories of self-concept development in males and females. On the one hand, gender intensification theory (Hill & Lynch, 1983) suggests that gender-role activities become more important to young adolescents over time as they try to conform more to gender-role stereotypes (see also Eccles, 1987) . Females become more negative about male-stereotyped domains, such as mathematics, and males become more negative about female-stereotyped domains, such as arts. On the other hand, the gender convergence hypothesis proposes the opposite development in gender differences in self-concept (Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, & Wigfield, 2002) . Proponents of this perspective argue that boys begin school with higher and unrealistic expectations, but that they adjust these expectations over the school years in response to performance feedback and the increased salience of social comparison processes. According to this view, the gender gap in self-concept decreases because girls do not initially overestimate their capabilities to the same extent as boys, meaning that the (negative) change in girls is smaller or even absent.",

The cultural context provides norms, such as gender-role stereotypes, which impact individuals' self-concept formation. These influences are thought to be transmitted by socializers' beliefs and behaviors (e.g., Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Frome & Eccles, 1998) and by their direct effects on individuals' perceptions.",

It is thus not clear to what extent the empirical results presented to date (see below) generalize across cultures that differ in their educational systems and prevailing gender norms. This article makes a first attempt to overcome previous limitations by drawing on large and representative data sets to investigate the development of students' selfconcept in relation to gender in three distinct cultural settings: Australia, Germany, and the United States. We focus on self-concept in the domain of mathematics and on the period from grades 7 to 12.",

However, these studies also showed that the pattern of decline varies across academic domains, with the sharpest drop in mathematics and a more modest decline in English (e.g., Eccles et al., 1983; Eccles & Midgley, 1989; Marsh, 1989; Wigfield, Eccles, Mac Iver, Reuman, & Midgley, 1991) . Early research linking the age-graded pattern of self-concept to gender revealed increasing gender differences, suggesting that these differences emerge during early adolescence and grow larger during late adolescence (Eccles, 1987; Eccles, Adler, & Meece, 1984) . However, later research has indicated that gender differences in self-concept emerge during the elementary school years and remain stable later on (Eccles et al., 1993; Marsh, 1989 Marsh, , 1993 Marsh & Yeung, 1998; Wigfield et al., 1997) . Recent studies were able to capitalize on more extended longitudinal assessments and more sophisticated statistical models, such as growth-curve modeling. For example, Fredricks and Eccles (2002) and Jacobs et al. (2002) drew on a data set spanning grades 1-12. They found a decreasing trend for mathematics, English, and sports self-concept. Initial gender differences in mathematics in favor of boys declined over time; gender differences in English in favor of girls increased until grade 8 and then declined somewhat; gender differences in sports in favor of boys declined very slightly. Most recently, Watt (2004) investigated the development of students' talent perceptions-a construct that is related to, but nevertheless different from, self-concept (Watt, 2000) -in mathematics and English. Watt found that gender differences in mathematics in favor of boys remained stable from grades 7 to 11, whereas there were no gender differences for English.",

(2002) found a pattern of gender convergence that was most evident for the domain of mathematics, Watt (2004) found such a pattern only for English (although point estimates for gender groups at each grade were not statistically significantly different) and observed a stable gender gap for mathematics. Because these studies are based on data sets from different cultural contexts with different school structures (i.e., the United States and Australia), it might be inferred that the cultural/institutional setting moderates students' self-concept development in relation to gender. Such an interpretation is very appealing, but the difference between studies may equally be attributable to other artifacts.",

Whereas the data set gathered in the United States (i.e., Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Jacobs et al., 2002) assessed students' competence beliefs, Watt (2004) used a measure of perceived talent. As noted by Watt (2000) , selfconcept and perceived competence are related, but load on different factors in factor analysis. Second, the growth curve modeling approaches (Meredith & Tisak, 1990) used differed in the degree of model restriction. Fredricks and Eccles (2002) and Jacobs et al. (2002) used a growth model with linear and quadratic time trends; Watt's model (2004) included an additional cubic trend. Third, the studies covered different time frames. Whereas the longitudinal studies conducted in the United States used observations from grades 1 to 12, the Australian study relied on assessments from grades 7 to 11.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of how contextual influences impact gender differences in self-concept development, we therefore extended previous research by including a new setting with a rather different educational structure from Australia and the United States, namely, Germany.",

The degree of gender differences in sex-typed attributes, such as mathematics self-concept, is likely to depend on the extent to which gender norms are differentiated in a cultural setting (Lynn & Martin, 1997) . Gender norms are said to be highly differentiated when many adjectives are clearly ascribed to men or to women, but not to both. Gender differentiation is said to be low when adjectives are ascribed to both genders (Williams & Best, 1990) . As shown by Williams and Best, countries differ in their degree of gender norm differentiation. Regarding the cultural settings investigated in this study (i.e., Australia, Germany, and the United States) Williams and Best (1990, p. 251) reported relatively high gender norm differentiation in Germany and substantially lower gender norm differentiation in Australia and the United States.",

The school systems under investigation differ in a number of respects. First, tracking takes place on the within-school level in Australia and the United States, but on the between-school level in Germany (with students being assigned to the lower, intermediate, or academic track). Second, tracking is implemented on the level of academic domains in Australia and the United States, but not in Germany, where students are assigned to tracks depending on their ''overall'' achievement in primary school. Third, tracking starts at different ages, beginning earlier in Germany (most often in grade 5) than in Australia or the United States. Furthermore, the German school tracks themselves differ. The intensity of the curriculum differs markedly across three secondary school tracks, meaning that once tracking has taken place students are exposed to different curricular demands for the rest of their school career. In Australia and the United States, in contrast, exposure to curricular demands is more flexible in terms of reversibility and domain specificity. It can be thus concluded that the German school system is rather different from the systems implemented in the United States and Australia (for more details, see Appendix A).",

Instead of using the conventional approach that relies on scale scores, we analyzed the data on the item level. To this end, we first formulated occasion-specific measurement models linking the observed item responses to the underlying time-specific constructs. The measurement part was constrained to be measurement invariant across time points (i.e., invariant factor loadings and measurement intercepts). Furthermore, we allowed for correlated item uniquenesses across time to account for the effects of specific factors not accounted for by the underlying common factors. Because measurement invariance is crucial for the proposed models, we investigated this issue very carefully. We found clear support for strong measurement invariance (Meredith, 1993) , meaning that factor loadings and measurement intercepts could be constrained to be invariant across time points in all samples considered. Establishing strong invariance is a prerequisite for interpreting the results of our LGM, because these imply a specific covariance structure of time-specific self-concept factors (requiring invariant factor loadings) in addition to a specific mean structure of the factors (requiring invariant measurement intercepts).

The initial-level factor was identified by fixing all loadings to unity. In order to identify the change factor, we fixed its loading in grades 7 to 0 and its loading in grades 10 to 1.

The w 2 -test is a classic goodness-of-fit index that is routinely reported in empirical studies, despite some well-known limitations. The w 2 measure tests the null hypothesis of zero deviations between modelgenerated data and observed data. A specified model is said to be falsified if the w 2 -test is statistically significant. However, it is well known (e.g., Brannick, 1995; Kelloway, 1995) that the test rejects correctly specified models far too often, especially when sample sizes are large (e.g., Hoyle, 1995) . Hence, in the case of large-scale data-as used here-the w 2 goodness-of-fit test is virtually always statistically significant. Because of the fundamental problems associated with the w 2 statistic, we judged model fit mainly on basis of the practical fit indexes CFI and RMSEA. Several guidelines for cut-off values have been suggested. CFI values 4.90 are typically taken to reflect an acceptable fit to the data (Marsh, Hau, & Grayson, 2005) . RMSEA values o.05 and .08 are taken to reflect a close fit and a reasonable fit, respectively; values between .08 and .10 reflect a mediocre fit, and values 4.10 are generally unacceptable (Browne & Cudeck, 1993) . In order to be better able to judge model fit, we also report the RMSEA test of close fit, which gives the probability that the fit index is RMSEA .05.",

The comparison of the form of change is based on the freely estimated factor loadings of the time-specific self-concept factors on the slope factor. As stated above, the growth factor was identified by fixing its loading on the grade 10 self-concept to 1. The remaining loadings can thus be interpreted in reference to the change from grades 7 to 10. The loading for grade X reflects the change from grades 7 to X relative to the change between grades 7 and 10. For example, a loading of 0.8 for grade X means that the change that has occurred between grades 7 and X is 80% of the size of the change between grades 7 and 10. Because the loadings are not sensitive to differences in the metrics of the analyzed items, they can be compared across groups. Note that the potential for comparing the functional form of self-concept across settings is rather restricted in this study on account of the limited number of data points available. Our comparison of the form of change is thus intended to be exploratory and descriptive. Figure 5 plots the loadings from the Australian (Sydney), German (four states), and U.S. (Michigan) samples. As shown, change in self-concept was nonlinear in Australia, with self-concept remaining more or less stable until grade 9 and then declining until grades 11 or 12 (see also Figure 2 ).",

The pattern of self-concept decline observed in the Australian (Sydney) sample is also in line with biological explanations: The steepest declines occurred between grades 9 and 10, when most students were between 14 and 16 years old, the time when the most dramatic pubertal changes are experienced.

From this perspective, stereotypic gender roles seem to have an important impact early in individual developmental trajectories. Our research suggests that such stereotypes seem to be more influential in some countries (e.g., Germany) than in others. This finding is line with the higher gender norm differentiation reported for German society (Williams & Best, 1990 ).

Furthermore, gender differences in mathematics self-concept account for a good deal of the gender effect on activity choices. From this perspective, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of self-concept development in males and females. As shown in the present article, the development of mathematics self-concept appears to be highly similar across cultural settings. No qualitative differences were found in the form of self-concept change, and gender relations with selfconcept development were absent in all investigated settings. Taken together, the present findings for grades 7-12 do not support the predictions of either gender intensification theory or the gender convergence hypothesis. On the contrary, the period under investigation seems to be characterized by stable gender differences across cultures. advanced, intermediate, and standard mathematics classes based on their demonstrated ability up to that point. In grades 11 and 12, which lead up to the Higher School Certificate, a major external examination supplemented by within-school assessment, students elect which subjects to study. Although mathematics is not compulsory, the overwhelming majority of students opt to take the subject, which is generally perceived to be important and is a requirement for many tertiary courses. Students preparing for the Higher School Certificate also select within each academic domain which difficulty level they wish to undertake.",
