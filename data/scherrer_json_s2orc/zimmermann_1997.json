Female adolescents were more likely to be in the steadily decreasing self-esteem group while male adolescents were more likefy to be in the moderate and rising ffoup. African American and white youth were equally distributed across groups.

Researchers also suggest that a universal human desire exists to protect and enhance one's self-worth (Covington, 1984; Maslow, 1970) . The role of self-esteem in adolescent development is well documented (Harter, 1990; Suls, 1989) . Low self-esteem has been associated with depression (Harter, 1986; Reinherz et al., 1989; Rosenberg, 1965) , suicide (Kazdin et al., 1983) , delinquency (Bynner et al., 1981; Rosenberg et al., 1989; Wells and Rankin, 1983) , substance use (Dielman et al., 1989a; Selnow, 1985; Stacy et al., 1992) , and poorer academic outcomes (Barnes and Welte, 1986; Hawkins et al., 1992; Johnston and O'Malley, 1986; Kandel, 1980) . Consequently, the successful development of a positive sense of selfworth may help enhance healthy outcomes or protect youth from engaging in problem behaviors.",

Research that has included longitudinal analysis of self-esteem change over time has produced inconsistent results. Demo and Savin-Williams (1992) report that over extended periods of time \"there is remarkable consistency and stability to self-concept and overall judgments of self-regard\" (p. 135). They found slight increases, however, in self-esteem from ninth to tenth grades using both the Rosenberg and Coopersmith measures and also peer ratings (Savin-Williams and Demo, 1984) . Other investigators who have reported changes in self-esteem over time have also found gradual increases from Grades 7 to 12 with no apparent decrease during the adolescent years (McCarthy and Hoge, 1982; Nottelmann, 1987; O'Malley and Bachman, 1983; Rosenberg, 1986; Simmons et al., 1973) . Simmons et al. (1973) , however, found that when transition from elementary to junior high school included a change in school context, youths' self-esteem tended to decrease during this period. Conversely, when school context did not change between sixth and eighth grades, researchers have found increases in self-esteem (Demo and Savin-Williams, 1983; Simmons et al., 1979) .",

                "text": "In longitudinal studies examining change or developmental stability, researchers have focused on average self-esteem scores for all respondents to detect mean change over time. Developmental stability has been studied using across-occasion correlations of a single variable measured repeatedly. Correlations of .60 are typically presented as evidence of stability over time (Simmons and Blyth, 1987 ). Yet, both of these approaches have serious limitations (Hirsch et al., 1993) . Hirsch and DuBois (1991) pointed out that these two approaches may not be sensitive to intragroup variation. Studies of average change over time in a sample cannot determine if evidence of no change is due to no real change, or to the offsetting increases and decreases of individuals in the sample on the variable of interest. Correlational studies of stability are also limited because they typically account for less than half of the variation in the variable of interest (Dusek and Flaherty, 1981; O'Malley and Bachman, 1983) . This leaves open the possibility that subgroup differences exist. As a way to address these concerns, Hirsch and DuBois (1991) used a cluster analytic approach to identify subgroup variation. They found that youth could be characterized by one of four self-esteem trajectories-consistently high, consistently low, slightly increasing, and steeply decreasing. Their results suggest that self-esteem may be stable over time for some youths, but vary considerably for others.",

The sample consisted of over 1000 youth from sixth through tenth grades, almost 14% of whom were African American. This study builds on Hirsch and DuBois' work in two significant ways. First, the sample was considerably different. They studied 128 youth from a single school district. The sample in this study was larger, included more African American youth, and consisted of youth from several different communities and schools. Hirsch and DuBois (1991) recommended that their study be replicated with a larger, more representative sample. Second, Hirsch and DuBois' time frame for their study covered Grades 6-8, while the current analysis extended through Grade 10.",

The shortened version included items from all four domains: 6 global items, 4 school items, 3 peer items, and 4 family items. Sample items included the following: \"Do you like the way you are?\" \"Are you proud of your school work?\" \"Do kids your age like you?\" \"Do you get a lot of attention at home?\" Also, responses for the 17-item scale were dichotomized (yes = 1/no = 0) to present youth with a forced choice.

Thus, each youth had four data points-self-esteem scores in Grades 6, 7, 8, and 10-that were entered in a cluster analysis. Cluster analysis is a statistical procedure that classifies respondents by the pattern or profile defined by their responses on specific variables (e.g., self-esteem scores from four waves of data). The profiles may differ in shape or scale. A difference in shape for longitudinal data on the same variable might indicate that one respondent has similar values on all measures over time (a flat line) while another respondent might have successively increasing values on all measures over time (a sloped line). A difference in scale occurs when an individual has consistently higher scores as compared to another individual.",

Then, the total sample was clustered using initial centroids set to the weighted averages of thecentroids obtained from the split-half analyses. This procedure was used for the total sample analysis because the split-sample results provided an empirical basis for defining initial parameters. The number of youths who were assigned to different groups in the split and total sample analyses were then examined to assess cluster stability. Two procedures were used to determine the number of clusters to retain. These were (1) inspecting the change in values of the proximity coefficients, and (2) examining the theoretical meaningfulness of different solutions (see Aldenderfer and Blashfield, 1984; Everitt, 1980) . Ward's method, which uses squared euclidean distance as a proximity measure, was the clustering technique chosen to identify the initial cluster solution. Ward's method was especially suitable because it maximizes within-group homogeneity and between-group heterogeneity (i.e., defines groups that are highly dissimilar from each other). We also used Ward's method because it does not require specification of the number of clusters as other methods (e.g., k-means) typically do. Although the study by Hirsch and Dubois (1991) suggests that a four-cluster solution would be appropriate, we did not wish to constrain our solution based on a single study. In addition, enough differences existed between the studies (e.g., sample, measures) that specification of clusters might not be warranted. Finally, we believed an effort to replicate should not impose the results from earlier work because it would create a biased situation in which similar findings would be more likely.",

In fact, it is remarkable how similar the self-esteem trajectories were in our study and the Hirsch and DuBois (1991) study in spite of the fact that we used different measures of self-esteem, the samples are quite different, and our clustering algorithm differed. Our largest self-esteem group, as in Hirsch and DuBois (1991) , comprised youth with consistently high self-esteem. Similarly, our smallest group included those youth with low self-esteem, although in our sample, this group also displayed steadily falling levels of self-esteem. This difference from the Hirsch and Dubois (1991) study may well be attributed to the fact that our study included self-esteem assessment in tenth grade, but most of the decrease occurred from sixth to eighth grade. It is also possible that this difference is due to the fact that we did not use the same self-esteem measures. Both studies, however, revealed a group of youth who show a steady decline in their self-esteem over time, and a group that show an increase in self-esteem over time.",

Although the number of African Americans in the sample was small, it corresponded with the proportion found in the general population. Nevertheless, future research should include a more diverse sample in order to adequately explore possible race differences including Latino, Asian American, and other ethnic groups. Perhaps more to the point, studying youth from varying socioeconomic backgrounds may be more informative than simply examining race differences. Our results are consistent with previously reported gender differences (Eccles, 1984; Simmons and Blyth, 1987) . More female adolescents reported decreasing selfesteem trajectories than male adolescents and vice versa for increasing self-esteem. This seems to support findings by Eccles and Midgley (1990) , who indicated that females were more likely than males to report a decline in self-esteem as a consequence of school transition. Youth in our sample actually experienced two school transitions during the course of the study.",

The results of grades, however, for these two groups were even more divergent. The two groups essentially switched places in high school for grades.

This raises some question about the stability of the self-esteem trajectories identified in the study. The limitation is offset by several points. First, the shapes of the profiles in the two split-half and final solutions were similar. Although some youth had profiles that were borderline to two groups, the underlying patterns of self-esteem remained the same. Second, most disagreement between solutions occurred between the consistently high and moderately increasing groups. In other words, the movement from one group to another was subtle, and probably a result of the clustering algorithm. Ward's method adjusts the group centroid as new cases are assigned and then uses that new information for assignment of the next case. Thus, respondents with values that are between two centroid series may be assigned to different groups depending on who was entered before them. Third, the cluster solution replicated previous research. The similarity of the split-half and final trajectories to the Hirsch and DuBois (1991) findings (which resulted from a different clustering algorithm) suggests that the longitudinal self-esteem profiles found in this study accurately characterize self-esteem patterns in early to middle adolescence.",

It allows for the possibility of discovering intergroup variation in a sample and avoids problems associated with studying average change over time.
