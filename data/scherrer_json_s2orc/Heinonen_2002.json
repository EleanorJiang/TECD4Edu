    "abstract": "A six-year longitudinal study investigated the impact of maternal hostile child-rearing attitudes, role dissatisfaction, and maternal perceptions of adolescent temperamental difficultness on self-esteem in late adolescence, after controlling for the initial self-esteem measured in early adolescence. Adolescents (n \u00bc 313), derived from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study, rated their self-esteem at the study entry at age 12, and six years later at age 18. Maternal reports of child-rearing attitudes, of role satisfaction, and of the temperament of the adolescent were obtained at the study entry and three years later. Mother's perceptions of adolescent's temperament as difficult at ages 12 and 15 predicted adolescent's self-reported self-esteem in late adolescence, whereas earlier self-esteem did not predict later perceptions of temperament or parenting. We found no evidence that maternal perceptions of parenting indirectly, or after controlling for the initial level, predicted adolescent's self-reported self-esteem.",

                "text": "Adolescence has been targeted as a developmentally consequential period for self-esteem. Self-esteem, conceptualized as evaluative judgements about self (Coopersmith, 1967; DuBois, Felner, Brand, Phillips, & Lease, 1996) , or as overall feelings of worth or value as a person (Harter, 1993; Rosenberg, 1979) , has shown to be one of the central factors affecting psychological and social adjustment and well-being (Dumont & Provost, 1999; Dekovic & Meeus, 1997; Hammond & Romney, 1995; Scheier, Botvin, Griffin, & Diaz, 2000; Willcox & Sattler, 1996) . Although self-esteem has shown to have substantial rankorder stability across time (Alsaker & Olweus, 1992; Block & Robins, 1993; O'Malley & Bachman, 1983) , there are considerable variations in developmental trajectories as well (Block & Robins, 1993; Deihl, Vicary, & Deike, 1997; Hirsch & DuBois, 1991) . In particular, self-esteem may change during adolescence because the period is characterized by several novel events and experiences, such as pubertal development, increases in cognitive abilities, and transition to middle school, that challenge individuals' views of themselves (cf. Caspi & Roberts, 1999; Twenge & Campbell, 2001 ). In fact, longitudinal studies have shown that adolescence is an important stage for the development of selfesteem (see e.g. Block & Robins, 1993; McCarthy & Hoge, 1982 ; see Twenge & Campbell, 2001 , for meta-analysis): The rank-order stability of self-esteem tends to increase from adolescence onwards (Alsaker & Olweus, 1992) and the mean level decreases slightly during transition from elementary school to junior high and then rises again (Twenge & Campbell, 2001 ). However, relatively little empirical information exists on environmental and temperamental predictors of changes in self-esteem during adolescence. Thus, this study focuses on maternal child-rearing attitudes, maternal role satisfaction, and perceived difficult temperament as predictors of self-esteem in adolescence.",

                "text": "Theoretically and empirically, parenting has shown to be one of the most important factors affecting the development of self-esteem. Early symbolic interactionism theory (see Cooley, 1902; Mead, 1934) has pointed out that the primary source for the development of self-esteem is the evaluations received from significant others. These evaluations are suggested to shape individuals' own self-perceptions. Additionally, attachment (Bowlby, 1982) theory emphasizes the importance of mother-child interaction for self-development: children who experience parents as emotionally available, loving, and supportive are suggested to view themselves as valuable, loveable, and competent. Shek (1998) has shown that adolescents' or parents' perceptions of low levels of conflict with the father predicted increase in self-esteem over one year, but that conflicts with the mother did not predict change in self-esteem. Further, adolescents' perceptions of paternal but not maternal favourable parenting characteristics predicted increase in self-esteem over one year (Shek, 1999) . Fenzel (2000) has shown that social support from parents measured just before children went to middle school did not predict change in self-esteem during the transition. Finally, Deihl et al. (1997) demonstrated that students who had consistently high levels of self-esteem between the 7th and 10th grades reported retrospectively more satisfactory relationships with their parents than the group of students with a low level of self-esteem during the same period; students whose level of self-esteem increased slightly from the 7th to the 10th grades fell between these two groups.",

Indeed, it has been shown that maternal role dissatisfaction (e.g. as a mother, as a spouse, or at work; Katainen et al., 1999; Lerner & Galambos, 1985; McLoyd et al., 1994) and temperamental difficultness of the child (Katainen et al., 1997 (Katainen et al., , 1999 Lee & Bates, 1985; Lerner & Galambos, 1985; R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen & Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, 1992; van den Boom & Hoeksma, 1994) are associated with more negative parenting. Parental negativity may, in turn, increase maternal role dissatisfaction (see Belsky et al., 1991 ) and perceptions of the child as difficult (Bezirganian & Cohen, 1992; Engfer, 1986; Lee & Bates, 1985; Lerner & Galambos, 1985; R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen & Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, 1992) . Also, role dissatisfaction is linked with perceptions of the child's temperament as difficult (Katainen et al., 1999; Lerner & Galambos, 1985) . Finally, in addition to parenting, maternal role satisfaction (Matteson, 1974 ) and child's temperament (Klein, 1992 (Klein, , 1995 Windle et al., 1986) are also suggested to be among the factors that are directly associated with the child's/adolescent's self-esteem. Thus, it is possible that parenting, role satisfaction, and temperament may have a joint impact on the development of self-esteem. However, to our knowledge there are no previous studies that have examined the direct and indirect effects of maternal child-rearing, maternal role satisfaction, and child temperament on self-esteem during the adolescent years.",

A previous article (Heinonen, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, & Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, submitted) , based on the young Finns sample (\u00c5 kerblom et al., 1991) , tested whether maternal child-rearing attitudes, role dissatisfaction, and maternal perceptions of the child's difficult temperament measured in childhood predict self-esteem in adolescence across six years. It was shown that in a group of six-and nine-year-old children maternal perceptions of the child's temperament as difficult predicted maternal hostile child-rearing attitudes three years later, attitudes that, in turn, predicted lower self-esteem three years later in adolescence. The age of the sample, i.e. 6 and 9, precluded ratings of self-esteem at the study entry, and, consequently, precluded studying changes in self-esteem across time.",

The first scale, comprising four items, tapped the emotional significance of the child (e.g. 'The child is not emotionally significant to me', 'I do not enjoy being with the child'), the second scale including three items focused on the mother's tolerance toward the child (e.g. 'The child makes me nervous', 'The child is a burden to me'), and the third scale, consisting of two items, concerned the disciplinary style of the mother (e.g. 'disciplinary actions are regularly needed with the child'). Items were answered with a five-point scale from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree), except the disciplinary style questions at the baseline, when the scale was 1 (no) to 2 (yes). The component constellation closely resembles the constellation named 'a hostile child-rearing attitude' (Schaefer, 1959 ; see also Holden & Edwards, 1989; R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen & Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, 1992) . According to Schaefer (1959) , hostile child-rearing attitudes consist of three elements: the mother's emotional rejection of her child, her feelings that the child is a burden, and her strict disciplinary style. The reliability estimates of internal consistency for the individual dimensions have been shown to range from 0.54 to 0.91 (Katainen et al., 1997; R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen & Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, 1992) . More detailed information regarding the questionnaire is available in the article by R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen (1992) . (For validity and three-year rank-order stability of the hostile child-rearing attitudes construct, see the results section; see also R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Katainen, & Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, 2000.) Mother's role satisfaction The mother's role satisfaction was assessed using scales derived from the Operation Family Study (Makkonen et al., 1981) . These items addressed the mother's satisfaction with herself as a mother, and as a spouse, and with her role at work, evaluated on a scale ranging from 1 (totally agree) to 5 (totally disagree) (e.g. 'I am satisfied with myself as a mother'). The one-item nature of the scale prohibited internal consistency testing. For validity and three-year rank-order stability of the mother's role satisfaction construct, see the results section (see also Katainen et al., 1999) .",

Activity was assessed on a four-point scale ranging from 4 (always extremely active and energetic, even restless) to 1 (always calm and controlled). Cooperation was evaluated on a threepoint scale ranging from 3 (continuous problems in cooperating with peers) to 1 (always very cooperative and responsive to others). Negative emotionality of the child was evaluated using three items ('Other children's parents often complain about the child's behaviour', 'The child often fights', and 'The child uses too many swear words') on a twopoint scale (statement doesn't fit the child-the statement fits the child) at the baseline and on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree) at the first follow-up. Together, these dimensions refer to a constellation of perceived child difficultness or perceived difficult temperament (see Goldsmith et al., 1987) . The one-item nature of the activity and cooperativity scale prohibited tests of internal consistency. The reliability of negative emotionality has previously been shown to be acceptably high, ranging from 0.63 to 0.81 (see Katainen et al., 1997; Katainen, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, & Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, 1998) .

Self-esteem A shortened version of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (Coopersmith, 1967; Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, 1990 was used.

Self-esteem was evaluated on a three-point scale at the study baseline and on a five-point scale at the six-year follow-up, ranging from 'totally disagree' to 'totally agree' at both data collections.

Thus, we included paths from child-rearing measured at the study entry to the later self-esteem, controlling for initial values of self-esteem, as well as for concurrent correlations between child-rearing and self-esteem at the study entry (cf. Neyer & Asendorpf, 2001 ). Next, we replaced the childrearing construct with the role satisfaction construct, and finally with the temperament construct, and re-ran the model. The same models fitted both for girls and for boys. The results showed that mother's hostile child-rearing attitudes and perceived difficult temperament of the adolescent predicted adolescent's lower self-reported self-esteem in late adolescence, after controlling for the initial self-reported self-esteem in early adolescence ( > |0.23|, p < 0.01; 2 /df < 1.52, CFI > 0.90, NNFI > 0.89, RMSEA < 0.058, R 2 > 0.18, for the combined models of girls and boys). Maternal role satisfaction was not significantly associated with adolescent's self-reported self-esteem. Second, we tested an a priori saturated model, which included (i) paths from the maternal perceptions measured at the study entry, when the adolescent was aged 12, to adolescent's self-reported self-esteem measured at the follow-up exam in late adolescence at age 18; (ii) paths from the maternal perceptions at the follow-up exam, when the adolescent was aged 15, to adolescent's self-reported self-esteem measured in the follow-up exam in late adolescence at age 18; (iii) paths between the dissimilar maternal perceptions from the study entry to the follow-up, e.g. from hostile child-rearing attitudes measured at the study entry to perceived difficult temperament measured at the follow-up; (iv) paths from self-esteem measured at the study entry to maternal perceptions measured at the follow-up. The model controlled for initial values of self-esteem, for initial values of the maternal perceptions, and for all correlations between the study variables at the baseline and at the three-year follow-up (cf. Neyer & Asendorpf, 2001 ). The saturated model did not show acceptable fit. Thus, we omitted the non-significant paths one by one. Figure 1) . We found no evidence that maternal perceptions, indirectly or after controlling for their initial level, predicted adolescent's self-reported self-esteem. Neither were there any significant relations from self-esteem to maternal perceptions, suggesting the associations between maternal perceptions and self-esteem are not bi-directional.",

The hostile child-rearing attitudes are stable when measured individually ( \u00bc 0.58, p < 0.01); however, the stability becomes secondary in this model. study participants were followed from early to late adolescence, a period during which self-evaluations have been suggested to be challenged (cf.

In addition to the theoretical perspectives of symbolic interactionism (Cooley, 1902; Mead, 1934) or attachment (Bowlby, 1982) , the personality-environment transaction may provide a fruitful perspective to interpret the findings. A significant proportion of the population variance in self-esteem is due to genetic factors, which, in turn, is probably manifested or acts via temperamental characteristics (Kendler, Gardner, & Prescott, 1998) . Moreover, the finding that the rank-order stability of maternal perceptions of adolescent's temperamental difficultness was high, and our results that mothers' perceptions of the adolescents' temperament as difficult at ages 12 and 15 did indeed predict adolescent's self-reported self-esteem, may support the suggestion that the effect of a stable personality trait is constant and may accumulate over time (cf.

Further, it has been suggested that heritability of most traits may increase across adolescence because genetic effects presented early in life help to create larger phenotypic differences across time (Plomin, DeFries, McClearn, & Rutter, 1997; cf. Plomin, DeFries, & Loehlin, 1977; Scarr & McCartney, 1983 , for proactive personality-environment transaction).",

Although the hostile child-rearing attitude constellation did predict self-esteem in late adolescence when the maternal perceptions were tested separately, hostile child-rearing attitudes did not significantly predict self-esteem in the final model in the presence of the other maternal perceptions. This result may reflect the fact that even though adolescents still evoke parental responses that are in line with their temperamental characteristics, the contextual family factors (e.g. maternal child-rearing and role satisfaction) may become less relevant in adolescence when compared with childhood (Pekrun, 1990) .

During adolescence, the relevance of a peer group increases (see e.g. Kirchler, Palmonari, & Pombeni, 1993) and might become a more significant source of social feedback than feedback given by parents.

The non-standardized childhood measures used in this study to evaluate the mother's child-rearing attitudes, her role dissatisfaction, and perceived difficult temperament of the child are not the best currently available. Measurement limitation stems partly from the fact that the baseline of this study was conducted over 20 years ago. However, the confirmatory factor analyses do provide some evidence of the construct validity of the childhood measures (see also Katainen et al., 1999; R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen et al., 2000) . Further, we have recently demonstrated that maternal perceptions of difficult temperament predict self-rated difficult temperament over 17 years (Pesonen, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Keskivaara, & Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, in press ). Moreover, maternal subjective evaluations have been shown to be relatively stable (see also e.g. Katainen et al., 1997 Katainen et al., , 1998 R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen et al., 2000) .",

The mother's evaluations may have been affected by subjective bias or measurement error. However, maternal evaluations have also earlier been shown to predict self-reported personality and psychological and physiological well-being in earlier reports using the current dataset (e.g. Katainen et al., 1999; Pesonen et al., in press; Ravaja, Katainen, & Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen, 2001; R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen et al., 2000) , which strengthen the validity of these measures. Furthermore, regarding the maternal reports of child's temperament there is evidence of objective as well as subjective components of a mother's evaluation (Mebert, 1991) . Furthermore, Bates (1983) has suggested that both the mother's subjective perceptions and the objective within-the-child temperament factors affect later developmental outcomes. Finally, parental and observer ratings have shown to be correlated (Matheny, Wilson, & Thoben, 1987) . However, a need for studies that use multiple measurements and informants of temperament and parenting characteristics certainly exists.",

Moreover, besides parenting, other environmental factors, e.g. peer and sibling support, should also be included in studies of adolescent self-esteem. Finally, future research on the development of self-esteem may benefit from combining different perspectives of studying change (see Caspi & Roberts, 1999) : these include approaches that focus both on rank-order and mean-level change, and that combine both the individual differences in developmental paths of self-esteem and general trajectories of its development.",
