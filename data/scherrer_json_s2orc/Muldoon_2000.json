    "abstract": "Little is known about the changes in self-perceptions over the course of middle childhood, despite this being a crucial period for the development of the self. This study examined stability and change in children's self-competence and self-esteem in a two-wave longitudinal study of primary school children. The in uence of psychosocial factors, gender, religion/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES), on the development of self-perceptions was also examined. A sample of 110 children completed the Harter Self Perception Pro le for Children at age 8 and age 11. Analysis of these data indicated considerable stability in children's perceptions of themselves. At age 11, a greater variety of domain-speci c self-perceptions was predictive of global self-esteem, suggesting a more complex view of the self. Additionally, between-group differences suggested that girls' global and athletic competence, as well as their con dence in their physical appearance, decreased over time. Further, children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and those from the minority community in Northern Ireland (Roman Catholics) displayed less positive self-perceptions in a number of life domains at both age 11 and age 8. Discussion of these results highlights the in uence of societal factors on children's social development and the need to consider the combined effects of psychosocial identities and socioeconomic background on the development of the self.",

Self-esteem is most often viewed as the evaluative component of the self which re ects a generalized sense of social worth: an indication of a child's perception of his or her value as a person (Harter, 1985 (Harter, , 1993 . Self-competence is a theoretically related construct which re ects a person's sense of ef cacy in a particular area of life. As such, self-competence can be seen as a more autonomous or inner dimension of the self (Tafarodi & Swann, 1996) .

During this period, self-perceptions are thought to become both more balanced and more highly differentiated. Thus children's self-perceptions tend to become more consistent with the views that others have of them (Harter, 1990 (Harter, , 1997 .

In terms of overall self-competence or self-esteem, the position is less clear. A number of studies have reported increases in global self-esteem during the transition from elementary to junior high school in the US (e.g. Proctor & Choi, 1994) , whilst others suggest that this period is marked by a decrease in selfcompetence (e.g. Wig eld, Eccles, Maclver, Reuman, & Midgley, 1991) . However, any changes in children's self-competence over this transition may re ect the effects of school change rather than spontaneous developmental processes. Available cross-sectional research, undertaken in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, suggests that for some groups of children their self-perceptions become less positive over the ages of 8 to 11 (Harter, 1982; 1988; Muldoon & Trew, in press) .",

First, in comparison to middle childhood, self-perceptions are relatively stable during adolescence (Lintunen, Leskinen, Oinonen, Salinto, & Rahkila, 1995) . Alsaker and Olweus (1992) suggested the gradual consolidation hypothesis to explain this increased stability associated with adolescence. This position proposes that later experiences have a decreasing impact on self-perceptions and, as such, points to the importance of middle childhood to the development of selfperceptions. Secondly, such studies have highlighted the fact that gender differences in self-perceptions are most likely to develop during middle childhood. Marsh (1989) concluded that small gender effects favouring boys were evident in relation to global selfesteem measures, whereas gender differences in children's competence across speci c domains tended to favour boys and girls in line with traditional gender role stereotypes. These differences that are evident in early adolescence have been attributed to the assumption of gender roles (Eccles et al., 1989) , with children of both genders displaying increasingly extreme differences in their activities and perceptions.",

Granleese, Trew, & Turner, 1988; Harter, 1982 Harter, , 1988 Muldoon & Trew, in press; Van Wersch, Trew, & Turner, 1990) in selfperceptions during late childhood and early adolescence is not surprising, given the importance of social factors to both the acquisition of knowledge (Bruner, 1990) and the development of the self-concept (Harter, 1985 (Harter, , 1988 . Although theorists differ as to the exact origins of the concept of the self, the importance of social in uences is widely acknowledged (Harter, 1988; Taylor, 1997) . Self-esteem is believed to be in uenced by other aspects of the self such as one's social or collective identity and esteem (Frable, 1997; Taylor, 1997) . Collective identity and esteem relate to how individuals view and evaluate groups of which they are members (Porter & Washington, 1993) . Self-esteem is believed to derive in part from collective esteem: for example, positive evaluation of one's social group is likely to result in more positive evaluations of the self (Frable, 1997; Major, Spencer, Schmader, Wolfe, & Crocker, 1998) . Negative evaluations or stereotypes of given groups may have an effect on the individual's collective and personal esteem, even if they do not subscribe to such stereotypes (Major et al., 1998) . Further to this, the effects of societal evaluations of social groupings are most likely to rst manifest themselves in middle childhood as this is the period during which children develop an awareness and understanding of the constant nature of their own gender, class and ethnic group identities (Aboud, 1987; Maccoby, 1990) .",

Generally, the majority Protestant community, the unionists, wish to remain part of the United Kingdom, whereas the minority Catholic community, the nationalists, wish to be united with the Republic of Ireland. Previous authors have suggested that there is a psychological cost associated with minority group status that may be evidenced in lowered self-esteem and competence (Simpson, 1993; Thompson & Spacapan, 1991) . As yet limited evidence is available to support this position in the Northern Irish context. Two studies undertaken suggest that Catholic (minority group) adolescents are more ambivalent about their social identities and evaluate their own group less positively than do Protestant (majority group) adolescents (Cairns, 1987; Stringer & Cairns, 1983) . However, a more recent study (Hunter, Stringer, & Coleman, 1993 ) that measured selfesteem directly found no differences in adolescents' (aged 14-15) scores in relation to religious/ethnic identity. Conversely, a cross-sectional study of 8-11-year-old children in Northern Ireland found that Roman Catholic children perceived themselves as less accepted socially than their Protestant counterparts (Muldoon & Trew, in press ). Cairns (1989) suggested that this equivocal relationship may result from the complexity of the Northern Irish situation, where in fact both groups may view themselves as a majority: the Protestants as a majority in Northern Ireland and the Catholics as a majority in the island of Ireland. The need for further studies in this area is nonetheless marked. First, available research evidence has failed to establish the nature of the relationship between ethnic identity and self-perceptions (Frable, 1997; Phinney, 1990) . Additionally, to date there is no longitudinal research in Northern Ireland directly examining the relationship between ethnic group membership and self-perceptions in children.",

In an early study by Rosenberg and Pearlin (1978) , SES was found to be moderately related to adults' and adolescents' self-esteem; lower self-esteem was observed in those from lower classes. However, in childhood no association between self-esteem and SES was evident. A subsequent study of young adolescents' self-esteem and SES found that where non-traditional, child-centred measures of SES were used, the deleterious effects of social disadvantage were more readily observed (Wiltfang & Scarbecz, 1990) . In effect, the authors suggest that the failure to observe a relationship between SES and self-esteem in childhood may be because of the particular measure of SES employed. Measures of SES that tap into aspects of social disadvantage, pertinent to the day-to-day lives of children, are those that are likely to be the most useful.",

The absence of research in this area undermines many previous ndings (Frable, 1997) , given that there is some evidence to suggest that social identities may interact to in uence self-esteem (Munford, 1994) and as such the meaning of any main effects are altered (Johnson & Wichern, 1992) . The purpose of this study therefore was to examine the development of self-perceptions in middle childhood whilst also examining the effects that psychosocial factors have on its development. In the rst instance, this study aimed to examine changes in children's self-perceptions between the ages of 8 and 11, including an examination of the nature of the relationship between the various domains of self-perceptions at both ages. In addition, the study examined the role that psychosocial factors such as gender, SES and ethnicity/religion play in the development of children's self-perceptions. Speci cally, it was predicted that boys would have higher selfcompetence than girls in stereotypically male domains, and in line with the gender intensi cation hypothesis that these differences would become more marked with increasing age (Simmons & Blyth, 1987) . Secondly, it was predicted that middle-class children would report more positive self-perceptions than lower-class children and that Protestant children (the majority in Northern Ireland) would report more positive selfperceptions than Roman Catholic children (the minority group). Finally, the study aimed to examine the cumulative effects of these factors on children's developing selfperceptions.",

Children were designated as lower or middle SES on the basis of the school they attended and their place of residence. Children from three of the schools participating were categorized as lower SES whilst the children from the remaining two schools were categorized as middle SES. The low income schools were categorized as such because more than 70% of pupils at the schools were children of parents in receipt of income support (Local Management of Schools Statistics, 1996) and the Townsend deprivation scores (Townsend, 1979) for these children's area of residence indicated considerable poverty. Children classi ed as middle SES, on the other hand, attended schools where less than 7% of parents were in receipt of income support and corresponding deprivation scores did not suggest poverty was endemic to their area of residence.",

A four-way interaction relating to the effects of gender, SES, religion and age at testing on global self-esteem scores was observed (F(1,100) = 5.62, p < .05; see Table 5 ). To fully understand this effect, two ANOVAs were undertaken to examine the between-participants effects on global self-esteem scores at Time 1 and Time 2 separately. Analysis of the children's global self-esteem scores at age 8 suggested no signi cant differences between the various social groups (overall mean = 3.11, SD = 0.55), although there was a trend that related lower self-esteem to lower SES (group mean = 2.99; F(1,100) = 3.098, p < .085). By age 11, however, gender, SES and religion interacted to signi cantly affect children's global self-esteem scores (F(1,100) = 8.91, p < .01). Post hoc analyses of this effect indicated that it was attributable to lower-class Roman Catholic girls reporting signi cantly lower global self-esteem scores at age 11 (M = 2.74) than both middle-class Protestant (M = 3.40) and Catholic (M = 3.21) boys as well as working-class Roman Catholic boys (M = 3.34) of the same age (see Fig. 1 ).

Boys (M = 3.21, SD = 0.58) reported signi cantly higher levels of global self-esteem at age 11 than their female counterparts (M = 2.95, SD = 0.54).

At age 11, however, children's global self-esteem was predicted by scores from four domains of self-competence: physical appearance, social acceptance, scholastic competence and athletic competence. In all cases the predictive power of these perceptions was in the expected direction, that is higher scores in each of these domains fed into higher global self-esteem. This nding is important for two reasons. First, it suggests that children's global self-esteem is generated from a wider and more diverse picture of their competencies towards the end of childhood than at an earlier age. Such ndings are consistent with previous research which suggests that over the course of middle childhood children develop an ability to process information about the self in a more abstract and differentiated manner (Case, 1996; Harter, 1990) . Secondly, the ndings of the regression analyses point to the signi cance of children's perceptions of their physical appearance in predicting global self-esteem. Thus it can be said that children's perceptions of their physical appearance is of central importance to successful adjustment during the transition from childhood to adolescence.",

Girls' scholastic competence scores increased signi cantly over the ages of 8 to 11, so that no gender difference was evident by age 11. Similarly, Protestant children's scholastic competence scores increased signi cantly from Time 1 to Time 2, so that differences in these scores related to religion were no longer evident at age 11. In the same way, children from middle-class backgrounds reported a signi cant increase in perceived social acceptance over the ages of 8 to 11.

MANOVA indicated that children's global self-esteem was related to age, gender, religion and SES. Subsequent analysis of this effect revealed that these differences were attributable to differences in global self-esteem at age 11. Whilst girls tended to have signi cantly lower global self-esteem than boys, lower SES, Roman Catholic females seemed to be particularly at risk of developing low global self-esteem.

This nding is not consistent with the notion that majority group status is bene cial to children's perceived competence. In fact, this nding is counterintuitive. The reason for this nding, whilst subject to speculation, may relate to the more disciplinarian approach to education normally associated with Catholic schooling. It is also worth noting that these results suggest that children tend to view their behaviour more negatively at age 11, possibly because of the increased incidence of both major and minor delinquent acts associated with adolescence.",

Five of the six dimensions of self-perceptions considered were related to gender through either a main or interaction effect. In all but one case, that of behavioural conduct, differences related to gender favoured boys. In the case of scholastic competence, gender differences in evidence at age 8 were no longer in evidence at age 11. Conversely, differences relating gender to global self-esteem and physical appearance scores were only evident at age 11. This nding is consistent with the gender intensi cation hypothesis, which suggests that gender differences in selfperceptions increase with age (Simmons & Blyth, 1987) . Gender differences in athletic competence were, however, evident at both age 8 and age 11.",

This research, though enhanced by a longitudinal design, would have been strengthened by a larger sample of children and in particular an increase in cell sizes. Secondly, the indicators of religious af liation and SES employed in this study were based on characteristics of the school attended. These factors were indexed in this manner because of the dif culties associated with questioning children about their social and religious backgrounds against a backdrop of armed political con ict. These indicators are open to a degree of error. Future research should attempt to establish directly the relationship between children's evaluations of their own social identities and their self-perceptions, to further understanding of the complex relationship between psychosocial factors and the development of the self. Future research would also bene t from a larger sample, accessed from a larger number of schools. This would prevent cells, representing a particular religion and social class, being comprised of children from only one school. This factor limits the interpretation of two interaction terms which relate SES and religion to self-perceptions.",

The study highlights the relative stability of self-perceptions across middle childhood and the pivotal role of children's perceptions of their physical appearance to their global self-esteem. The ndings also highlight that the development of selfperceptions in middle childhood is a complex process that is in uenced by the psychosocial context of children's development. Finally, the between-group differences suggest that membership of less socially potent groups confers a psychological disadvantage on children, at least in terms of self-esteem and self-competence. This conferral is perhaps best conceptualized as the psychological representation of social disadvantage.",
