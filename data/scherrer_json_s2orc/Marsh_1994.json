A wide variety of approaches were critically examined that considered the stability of means, individual differences (i.e., test-retest correlations), and factor structures using traditional approaches (e.g., ANOVA and correlations) and structural equation models. Structural equation models based on multiple indicators provided a unified analytic approach for evaluating different aspects of stability and offered important advantages over traditional approaches. We describe a hierarchy of invariances and the nature of interpretations that are justified by different patterns of factor structure invariance associated with each level. We conclude that the assumptions underlying the typical repeated-measures ANOVA approach to testing mean differences in longitudinal data are far more restrictive, less easily tested, and less likely to be met than those in the structural equation modeling approach advocated here, and that the use of ANOVA for this purpose requires a huge leap of faith that can rarely be justified on logical or empirical grounds. This investigation is a methodological demonstration of different approaches to evaluating stability in longitudinal, multiwave panel studies.

                "text": "Self-concept theorists are concerned with the stability of self-concept. Rosenberg (1985) emphasized the need for an individual to have a reasonably stable self-concept because \"the self-concept is his most fundamental frame of reference; without a firm clear picture of what one is like, the individual is virtually immobilized\" (p. 220). Rosenberg also noted similar conclusions by other theorists. Markus and Kunda (1986) argued that \"the most pervasive and least ambiguous finding to emerge from the recent surge of research on self-concept is that individuals seek out consistency and stability and actively resist any information that challenges their prevailing view of themselves\" (p. 858). There has been particular interest in the stability of self-concept during the adolescent period, which has been characterized (Dusek & Flaherty, 1981) as a time of storm and stress. In contrast to this characterization, there is growing evidence that self-concept is relatively stable during adolescence and that growth is gradual and continuous (e.g., Dusek & Flaherty, 1981; Marsh, 1989; O'Malley & Bachman, 1983) . These are primarily concerns with the stability of individual differences in self-concept as inferred from test-retest correlations across two or more occasions. Self-concept researchers are also concerned with developmental changes in self-concept over time. Here interest focuses on changes in the mean levels of self-concept as a function of age. Marsh (1989) , for example, reviewed previous research and presented analyses of responses by over 12,000 individuals varying in age from early childhood to young adulthood. Across many different studies and various components of self-concept, a reasonably consistent picture arose. For responses by pr\u00e9adolescents there was a linear decline in self-concept with age. During early adolescence there was a reasonably consistent quadratic effect; the decline in self-concept continued through Grades 8 and 9 (about the age of puberty), and then began to increase. For responses by late adolescents there was a reasonably consistent linear increase in self-concept that continued through at least early adulthood. Whereas most of this research consisted of cross-sectional studies in which changes in self-concept were inferred from the results of betweengroup analyses, a few of the studies were true longitudinal studies that used repeated-measures analyses.",

The basic issues addressed in self-concept research-the stability of individual differences, the continuity of growth, and changes in mean levels-are relevant to all individual difference variables. Whereas multiwave, longitudinal data provide an appropriate basis for evaluating these issues, researchers have often used weak or inappropriate statistical techniques. In particular, researchers have typically considered issues related to the stability of individual differences separately from evaluations of changes in mean levels of self-concept. Here we outline a unified approach that evaluates both questions within a single analytic framework. In illustrating this approach, we demonstrate potentially serious limitations in the typical repeated-measures analysis used to evaluate mean differences in longitudinal data.",

We compare traditional approaches based on raw scale scores for inferring mean differences (e.g., repeated-measures analysis of variance; ANOVA) and relations among raw scores (e.g., test-retest correlations) with structural equation models in which latent constructs are inferred from multiple indicators. There are many approaches to the study of stability and change (Bock, 1985; Collins & Horn, 1991; Goldstein, 1979; McArdle, 1988; Meredith, 1991; Plewis, 1985; Rogosa, 1979; Willett, 1988) . The aim of our presentation is not to provide a new, unique technique or statistical model of change. Rather, we attempt to provide an applied perspective on how issues fundamental to the analysis of longitudinal data and the interpretation of change can be addressed in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework that incorporates multiple indicators of each latent construct.",

Although many studies attempt to infer mean stability or growth on the basis of cross-sectional data, the advantages of longitudinal data for this purpose are well known, and the assessment of covariance stability studies requires longitudinal data. Evaluations of stability typically focus on either the stability of means over time or the stability of individual differences as inferred by covariance stability, but not both. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate approaches to inferring both types of stability and demonstrate the application of structural equation models that incorporate both approaches into a single analytic framework. Recent advances in the application of structural equation models (e.g., Byrne, Shavelson, & Muthen, 1989; J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 1988; Marsh & Grayson, 1990 ) allow researchers to compare the psychometric properties of the same measures across multiple groups, to compare latent means for the different groups, and to test the appropriateness of interpretations of these data. Here we demonstrate generalizations of the multigroup procedures to compare psychometric properties of the same instrument across multiple occasions within a single group, to compare means on latent constructs for the multiple occasions, and to test the appropriateness of interpretations of these data.",

For our purposes, responses were considered for the 1,341 students who responded to at least 8 of 10 items on all five occasions. For each wave, responses to the same 10 items were used to compute 5 item-pairs (item parcels or subscales) by computing the average response to the first 2 items, the second 2 items, and so forth. Across all five waves there were 25 measured variables (item-pairs; see Appendix A).

Bachman (1970) systematically evaluated appropriate design effects to compensate for this bias. Based on this research, Bachman and O'Malley (1986) suggested that an N of 1,000 should be used for purposes of testing statistical significance for a study based on a slightly larger number of students than considered here, and we adopted this value for our purposes.

Inspection of Table 2 reveals that, for the 1-year O2/O3 and 03/04 intervals, correlations are about .65 before correction for unreliability and about .80 after correction for unreliability. For the 8-year O1/O5 interval, the correlation is .30 before correction for unreliability and .39 after correction. Across all correlations, the mean r is .493 before correction for unreliability and .622 after correction. An inspection of the correlations suggests a simplex pattern (Guttman, 1954; Marsh, 1993) in which self-concept measures that are temporally closer together tend to be more highly correlated, whereas those that are more distant are less highly correlated.

To illustrate this logic, consider the model in Figure 1 in which observed self-esteem (tl and tl; the boxes) is measured at occasions 1 and 2 using the same instrument. Observed responses (tl and tl) represent the influences of the true, underlying self-esteem (71 and TT), random error (El and El), and specific variance that is idiosyncratic to the instrument (51 and S2). According to the model, the true scores (self-esteem) and specific components are correlated over time, whereas random errors are not. According to the model in Figure 1 , neither the observed nor the disattenuated correlations in Table 2 accurately reflect the correlation between the self-esteem true scores. The observed O1/O2 correlation may have two opposing biases. Because the influence of random measurement error has not been removed, the observed 01/02 correlation is attenuated and provides a negatively biased estimate of the true correlation. On the other hand, the observed 01/02 correlation may be positively biased by a failure to control for the positive correlation between SI and 52. The model in Figure 1 cannot actually be tested with scale scores, and the information in Table 2 provides no information about the relative strengths of these off-setting biases. The negative bias due to not correcting for error may be larger than the positive bias due to not controlling for correlations between specific variances so that the observed O1/O2 correlation will underestimate the true correlation. In contrast, the O1/O2 disattenuated correlation in Table 2 -which has been corrected for coefficient alpha estimates of reliability computed separately at each occasion-is a positively biased estimate of the true correlation. This follows because the effects of error have been removed in the disattenuated correlation, but there is no control for the positively correlated specific components that are confounded with true stability. The focus of structural equation models to be discussed later is to evaluate more fully these issues in the estimation of correlations between true scores. Although we illustrate these issues with the self-esteem data, concerns about correlated uniquenesses and the potential bias in interpretations of models that exclude them generalize to all multiwave data in which the same indicators are used ondifferentoccasions.",

The major deviation from linearity appears in the O3/O4 interval that represents the first year after graduation from high school. Although self-concept does increase during this interval, the increase is smaller than in other intervals. The deviations from linearity, although very small, are statistically significant due to the very large sample size. The questions to be addressed in subsequent analyses are whether mean differences between latent constructs that have been corrected for error show a similar pattern and whether assumptions underlying the interpretations of the manifest comparisons are plausible.

Guttman's (1954; see also, J\u00f6reskog, 1970 see also, J\u00f6reskog, , 1979 classic study of the simplex structure for relations among ordered tests provided an alternative representation that is one of the most popular approaches to evaluating covariance stability (Marsh, 1993) . The most salient property of the simplex for longitudinal data is that the sizes of correlations between measures collected at adjacent occasions are largest and that the sizes of correlations steadily decrease as a function of the number of occasions separating two measures. In a first-order simplex model (see Figures  2C) , self-esteem at each occasion is posited to directly affect self-esteem on the next occasion, but not to directly affect self-esteem on subsequent occasions. Thus, the correlation between self-esteem at any two nonadjacent occasions (e.g., Ol and O3) is zero when self-esteem from an intervening occasion (e.g., 02) is partialled out. In a second-order simplex, self-esteem at each time is posited to directly affect self-esteem on the next two occasions. Given a sufficient number of occasions, it is possible to fit third-order, fourth-order, or even higher orders of simplex models, although most researchers have focused on the first-order simplex. Marsh (1993; also see O'Malley & Bachman, 1983) argued for the superiority of the multiple-indicator simplex model considered here ( Figure 2C ) over the single-indicator simplex model based on scale scores. The multipleindicator simplex model is also nested under the general model ( Figure 2A) ; it is just a special case of the more general model with the additional assumption that correlations among the latent constructs form a simplex. If the simplex model accurately reflects the data, then the corresponding general model-because the simplex model is nested under it-must also accurately reflect the data, but the converse is not true. Whereas the first-order simplex is nested under the more general model, a simplex model with a sufficiently high order (i.e., paths connecting nonadjacent constructs differing by 2,3,4, or more occasions) is mathematically equivalent to our general model. The highest order simplex model that can be fit is one less than the number of occasions for the multiple-indicator models. Here, for example, the 4th order simplex is equivalent to our general model.",

A preliminary inspection of Table 2 , for example, reveals that, whereas coefficient alpha estimates of reliability are reasonably stable over occasions, the estimate is somewhat lower at Ol. Also, the variability of responses at Ol is somewhat larger than at subsequent occasions. These two observations imply that error variance is larger at Ol. Consistent with these observations, the uniquenesses in the general model (see Table 4 ) are systematically larger at 01 than at other occasions. In contrast, factor loadings appear to be reasonably consistent over time.",

In the multiple group approach it is possible to set any one parameter, any set of parameters, or all parameters to be equal in multiple groups. To the extent that a model with invariance constraints is able to fit the data as well as a corresponding model without constraints, there is support for the invariance constraints. These studies typically test for the invariance of different sets of parameters-particularly factor loadings, but also factor variances and covariances and measurement errors. Marsh and Hocevar argued that the minimum condition for factorial invariance is the invariance of factor loadings. Byrne et al., however, argued for tests of partial invariance in which it is only necessary for at least one estimated factor loading for each latent construct to be invariant across groups. In analogous tests of the invariance of the same measure over multiple occasions, it makes sense to test for the invariance of factor loadings over multiple occasions, but also, perhaps, of the true score variances of latent constructs and of the measurement errors for the same measured variable. As in the multiple group situation, the minimum condition for factorial invariance would seem to be the invariance of factor loadings over time, although it may be useful to pursue Byrne et al.'s notion of partial factorial invariance when tests of factorial invariance fail.",

Model 1A (Figure 2A ), the general model with correlated uniquenesses, must necessarily be able to fit the data as well as any model that imposes invariance constraints, and so it provides an important basis of comparison. In the first test of invariance (Model 3A), factor loadings for the same measured variable are held constant across the five occasions. Although the change in % 2 = 41 is statistically significant in relation to the change in df= 16, due in part to the large sample size, the goodnessof-fit indices are nearly the same. We interpret this as support for the invariance of the factor loadings over time. In the second test of factorial invariance (Model 3B), the factor variances of the five latent constructsself-esteem at the five occasions-are tested. The change in y? = 5 in relation to the change in df= 4 is not statistically significant, and so there is also support for this invariance constraint. When uniquenesses are held invariant over time (Model 3D), however, the change in % 2 = 280 due to this additional constraint is substantial in relation to the change in df= 20, and the goodness-of-fit indices are poorer. We interpret these results to mean that measurement errors are not invariant over time. Inspection of the modification indices indicated that measured variables from Ol contributed substantially to the lack of invariance of measurement errors over time, and this is consistent with earlier observations that error variance was larger at 01. In Model 3E, measurement errors were constrained to be invariant over O2-O5, but not 01. This substantially improved the fit, although the resulting model still did not fit as well as Models 2A, 3A, or 3B. Hence, these tests provide reasonable support for the invariance of factor loadings and factor variances over occasions, but not measurement error.",

First, the starting point for tests of the invariance of the covariance structures is the covariance matrix that is independent of the means of measured variables so long as the variables have a multivariate normal distribution. In contrast, the starting point for tests of mean structures is the matrix of moments about zero that incorporates the mean values. Second, there are two additional vectors of parameters to be estimated: a vector of regression intercepts for the measured variables and a vector of latent means that is of principal interest. In the typical multiple-group problem (e.g., J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 1988; S\u00f6rbom, 1974) , factor loadings and intercepts for measured variables are assumed to be invariant over groups, the latent means for one group are specified to be zero, and the latent means for other groups are freely estimated so that all latent means are scaled in relation to latent means from the first group. Byrne et al. (1989) , however, argued that it still may be reasonable to compare latent means so long as there is at least partial invariance. Subsequent analyses can be used to specify that one, some, or all of the latent means are invariant across groups and to test specific patterns of latent mean differences.",

In this context it is useful to adopt terminology from item response theory. We do not develop the formal equivalence between item response theory and SEM more fully because we are merely using terminology from item response theory by way of analogy and because this equivalence is demonstrated elsewhere (Christofferson, 1975; McDonald, 1982 McDonald, , 1985 . In this approach, each measured variable (t) is related to the latent construct (T) by the equation t = a + bT. The b parameter is the slope (or discrimination) parameter that reflects how changes in the observed variable are related to changes in the underlying construct. In structural equation models, the factor loadings reflect the b parameter, and support for the factorial invariance of factor loadings over time implies that the b parameters are invariant over time. The a parameter is the intercept (or difficulty) parameter that reflects the ease or difficulty in getting high manifest scores for a particular measured variable. The comparison of mean stability over time is most justifiable when both the a and b parameters are invariant over time. When both the relation between a measured variable and the latent construct (the b parameter) and the difficulty of getting a high score (the a parameter) are invariant over time, then changes in the measured variable apparently imply changes in the underlying construct. Typically, structural equation models are based on covariance matrices that contain no information about the means of the measured variables. In this instance it is possible to test the invariance of factor loadings (the b parameters) over time as we did earlier. For structural equation models based on moment matrices that also contain information about the means, however, it is possible to test the invariance of both the factor loadings (the b parameters) and the measured variable intercepts (the a parameters).",

In this approach: (a) the augmented moment matrix (computed by LISREL from the means, standard deviations, and correlation matrix in Appendix A) is a raw product-moment matrix augmented by one row and column (the 26th) to accommodate a constant variable consisting of the manifest means for the 25 measured variables and a 1 in the diagonal; (b) the original 25 measured variables (5 Measured Variables x 5 Occasions) are specified to be y variables, and the associated 5 latent constructs are specified to be TJS; (C) the constant variable is given a fixed-X specification; (d) the factor loading matrix A,, is augmented by one column (the 6th) to accommodate the constant variable, which is used to represent the measured variable intercepts; (e) the factor covariance matrix *P is augmented by one row and column (the 6th) of fixed zeros to accommodate the constant variable; (f) the mean differences in latent constructs are estimated in T by fixing the parameter estimate for Ol to be zero and freely estimating parameters for the other four occasions. In subsequent models, various transformations of the mean differences (e.g., polynomial trends) are introduced to facilitate interpretations of the means (see Appendix B for the LISREL setup and Appendix C for technical information on the matrix formulation used to generate this LISREL setup; also see Bock, 1985 , for a discussion of the estimation of chosen trends in longitudinal data, or Rao, 1973 , for further information). To maintain comparability with earlier analyses, we used the same null model as in analyses based on the covariance matrix. It may, however, be appropriate to use a more restrictive null model for analyses of mean moment matrices in which invariance constraints are placed on the intercepts of each measured variable consistent with those in subsequent models. This would result in slightly better fit indices for all latent mean models presented here so that our decision is conservative in relation to obtaining apparently acceptable fit indices.",

Model 4A, which posits five correlated factors, resulted in a substantial chi-square (Table 5) , but the TLI indicates that the fit is good and only modestly poorer than the TLI for the corresponding Model 3 based on the covariance matrix. Whereas the fit indices apparently support acceptance of the model, the large chi-square dictates that this needs to be interpreted cautiously. For this reason and for purposes of demonstration, we chose to pursue two different courses. First, we interpret results from the invariant means model and fit additional models with the same invariance constraints based on the assumption that the fit indices justify support of these invariance constraints. Second, we pursue the notion of partial invariance by freeing selected parameters that are invariant in the Model 4A and then evaluate parameter estimates based on this a posteriori, partially invariant structure.",

For example, using the same orthonormal contrasts as in the repeated-measures analysis (see Table 3 ), the five latent means in Model 4A were transformed into values representing a constant term (arbitrarily set to be zero for purposes of identification) and the linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic trend components of time. It is important to emphasize that this model is merely a transformation of the initial means model so that the goodness of fit is not affected (see Table 5 ). The linear trend component for the latent means is very large and statistically significant, the quadratic and cubic components are substantially smaller but still statistically significant, and the quartic component is not statistically significant.

The difference contrast (SPSS, 1988) is the difference between each mean and all prior means, for example, O2 versus Ol; O3 versus (Ol + O2)/2, and so forth. This contrast shows that self-esteem at each occasion is significantly higher than the mean of self-esteem measures from earlier occasions. The repeated contrast (SPSS, 1988) is the contrast between each mean and the subsequent mean (e.g., 01 vs. O2; O2 vs. 03; etc.). This contrast shows that self-esteem increases significantly during each interval except the O3/O4 interval that represents the first year after graduation from high school. For each of these contrasts, the latent means in Model 4A are merely transformed so that the number of estimated parameters and goodness of fit are not altered. Hence, the similarity of the estimates based on latent means to the manifest (raw score) means observed earlier for these data is necessarily observed in the results for each of these contrasts as well.",

For this reason and for purposes of demonstration, we evaluated a partially invariant means model. There are, however, potential problems with this approach, and some readers may find even the logic of partial invariance to be questionable, or at least debatable. Models based on this approach are a posteriori, and this new approach has not been widely applied. More important, the partially invariant approach is based on the apparently questionable premise that the underlying latent scale is accurately reflected by those indicators that are invariant over time. For these reasons, we agree with the Byrne et al. (1989) suggestion that results from this approach should also be interpreted cautiously. From this perspective, it is interesting to compare the results based on the invariant and partially invariant approaches. Using an ex post facto approach based on an inspection of LISREL's modification indices (J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 1988) , we evaluated invariance constraints for the factor loadings and measured variable intercepts over the 5 occasions. Inspection of LISREL's modification indices indicated that relaxing invariance constraints for 05 intercepts would have the largest effect on the chi-square. A step-wise process in which we freed the parameter associated with the highest modification index at each successive step resulted in freeing three of five measured variable intercepts for O5 (Model 5A in Table  5 ). In this Model 5A, the latent means for 01 to 04 are similar to those in the totally invariant means model (4A), whereas the latent mean for 05 is moderately smaller (Table 7) . Thus, the interpretation of the results of Model 5A is still similar to that offered for the invariant means model (4A). Although not pursued here, it would also be possible to transform these mean differences using polynomial, difference, and repeated transformations like those applied to the corresponding totally invariant means Model 4A (see Appendices B and C, Table 7 ).",

None of the interpretations of the data discussed here are justified without this axiomatic assumption of construct invariance. Construct invariance does not require any parameters to be invariant over time, but the assumption of construct invariance seems to be more plausible when this invariance does exist. Even with perfect invariance of factor loadings and manifest intercepts in structural equation models based on moment matrices, it is logically possible that the nature of the construct we are testing has shifted over time, making scores (manifest and latent) incomparable at a fundamental level. It is difficult to see how this could be tested, and it seems that construct invariance must ultimately be assumed in the manner of an underlying axiom.

(Walberg & Tsaai, 1983 , presented data showing that smaller differences at younger ages are associated with larger differences at older ages for a wide variety of variables-a pattern that he called the Mathew Effect using the biblical analogy of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.) The nonsignificant difference (Table 5) between Models 3A (factor loadings invariant) and 3B (factor loadings and factor variances invariant) provides a test of this hypothesis.

Here, we further demonstrated-logically and empirically-that the general model (Figure 2A ) is even better for inferring correlations among latent traits. This conclusion is important because each of the other approaches considered here can be considered as special cases of this general approach that require additional assumptions. If these assumptions are reasonable, then the alternative approach should result in estimates similar to the general model and may be argued to offer a more parsimonious description of the results. If these results are not reasonable, however, the alternative approaches will provide systematically biased estimates. This investigation indicated that each of the alternative approaches provided biased estimates for the data considered here, and at least the direction of these biases was predicted a priori. Whereas the size of the biases may vary substantially from study to study, the direction and pattern of biases observed here apparently will generalize broadly.",

In the application presented here, there was good support for the invariance of factor loadings based on the covariance matrix (e.g., Model 3A in Table 5 ), but somewhat weaker support for the invariance of factor loadings and measured variable intercepts based on the mean moment matrix. The relative fit indices suggested that the fit for the model based on the moment matrix is acceptable, but there is need for further study to establish guidelines about what constitutes an acceptable fit in this situation. Because we were concerned about the fit of the model in which factor loadings and manifest measured variable intercepts were constrained to be equal over occasions, we pursued a posteriori models in which there was partial invariance. Using LISREL's modification indices, we evaluated which particular invariance constraints contributed most substantially to the misfit. Consistent with earlier analyses demonstrating support for the invariance of factor loadings based on the covariance matrix, modification indices associated with factor loadings were consistently smaller than those associated with measured variable intercepts. In the final partially invariant model, invariance constraints were relaxed for three of five measured variable intercepts associated with 05. This suggests that the ease or difficulty in getting high scores apparently shifted at O5; this may not be surprising given that O5 is so temporally distant from the other occasions (the 04/05 interval is 4 years, whereas other intervals are approximately 1 year). These results provide additional support for interpretations of results for Ol to 04, but may dictate caution in the interpretations of the latent mean associated with O5. Even though the mean difference for 05 is somewhat smaller for the partially invariant model (Model 5A in Table 7 ), the general conclusions based on this approach are similar to those for the totally invariant mean model (Model 4A in Table 7 ), but this need not always be so.",

In offering this hierarchy of invariances, we emphasize that these absolutely fundamental interpretive issues can only sensibly be discussed or evaluated using multiple-indicator data within a SEM approach. It is therefore useful to evaluate the plausibility of interpretations based on the repeated-measures ANOVA in relation to the structural equation models considered here. In the typical ANOVA approach, critical assumptions include: (a) the complete factorial invariance of factor loadings over time, (b) the complete invariance of manifest intercepts over time, (c) the homogeneity of uniquenesses and a complete lack of correlated uniquenesses, (d) having multiple indicators that act as parallel forms of the underlying construct, and (e) circularity. If all these assumptions are met, interpretations based on the ANOVA and SEM approaches will be similar and may be justified. Many of these implicit assumptions are not apparent in the ANOVA approach because typically only a single measured variable at each occasion is considered. In fact, the assumptions underlying the ANOVA approach are far more restrictive, less easily tested or completely untestable, and less likely to be met than those in the SEM approach advocated here. Our position is that inferences of genuine latent mean differences on the basis of repeated-measures ANOVAs require a huge leap of faith that can rarely be justified on logical or empirical grounds.

The following model combines a \"standard\" latent means analysis (Sorbom, 1974) with a transformation of the latent occasion constructs to contrasts (of substantive choice) over these occasions. Such transformations are discussed in the more familiar context of manifest variables in Bock (1985;  particularly the addendum titled \"Univariate and Multivariate Analysis of Variance of Time-Structured Data\").Consider, firstly, the LISREL model for fitting an augmented raw productmoment matrix (with means) with a structure including latent means and variances. This approach \"offers\" LISREL a product-moment matrix augmented by a column and row of means (the last diagonal element being unity) and \"requests\" LISREL to fit it as a covariance matrix, with the following parameters:where E% = K, and \u00c7, e, and 8 have zero expectations. If, as in the present \"one sample\" case, there are no latent exogenous variables and no regressions among the latent constructs, this reduces to:where B = 0, Er\\ = cc, a, = 0 for identification and only constructs of the components of a, (p'a (q>' l = 0), are estimable.Consider, secondly, any T x 1 random vector r\\ (in general, latent or manifest; but in this article, to be identified with the latent self-esteem constructs on Ol, ..., 05). If Er\\ = a, then T\\ = a + \u00c7, where \u00c7 represents the T x 1 random vector of mean-corrected deviations (\u00a3\u00c7 = 0). We can now choose any full rank linear transformation, P, and define new scores r\\ = Pr\\. In the present context we are concerned with familiar contrasts, so we restrict attention to P matrices with structure:where with <p/l=O, 7=1 7*-l.The choices discussed in this article for the contrasts <p/ are trend components (on unequal intervals), difference contrasts and \"repeated\" contrasts. The new random vector r|* has mean a* = Pa. The last T -1 components of a* give the contrast values for the contrasts selected in the last T-1 rows of the matrix P. Mean-correcting the new scores, we obtain the contrast deviation scores (for individual subjects) \u00c7,* = i\\ -a*, and the VC-matrix of the new contrast scores is given by:Estimates of the mean and variance of the new contrast scores can be obtained (indirectly) by first fitting the reduced LISREL means model (as in the aforementioned Equation 1, with r\\ being a Txl vector), obtaining estimates of a and \u00bbF = \u00a3\u00c7\u00c7\\ and then setting a* = Pa and \u00a5* = PW.Alternatively, LISREL can be \"cajoled\" into directly supplying these estimates by interpreting Equation 1 as follows:These equations yield Tl = F x x\\ and Tj* = a* + \u00c7, consistent with the transformation discussed previously, with y = x y + A y t| + e still indicating the \"occasion\" constructs directly. That is, the terms t|, a, *P, B, A y , and \u00c7 in LISREL Equation 1 are now, respectively, fully identified with the contrast entities:As in Appendix B, the first component of a* must be set equal to a constant (0, for example). That is, the first T + 1 components in a in the LISREL run based on Equation 1 must be fixed at 0, the rest freely estimating the values of the T-1 latent contrasts chosen in P. All components of *F (2T x 27} in the LISREL run are fixed at 0, with the exception of the lower TxT diagonal block, which freely estimates the VC-matrix of latent variables r\\'. Finally, B(2Tx IT) in the LISREL run is fixed at 0, except for the upper right T x T block that is fixed at P\" 1 , the inverse of contrasts' matrix. (If and only if the rows of P are chosen to represent orthonormal contrasts, then P\" 1 = P', as with the trend contrasts.)",
