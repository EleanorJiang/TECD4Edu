While the development of achievement goals has often been investigated during the transition from elementary to secondary school in the US, the transition into different school tracks in countries with a stratified school system has rarely been studied. The German school system differs from those in Anglo-Saxon countries as the majority of the students are assigned to different school tracks: non-academic and academic tracks. Each of these tracks differs markedly from the others in the ability level of the students and the learning environments of the classes. Accordingly, the primary purpose of the current study is to examine the changes in achievement goals and in the association between achievement goals and achievement before and after the transition to non-academic and academic school tracks in secondary school.",

A mastery goal is the desire to acquire new skills, master new situations, and improve one's competence. Conversely, students with high performance goals seek to demonstrate or prove one's competence to others. Additionally, the distinction between approach and avoidance is made for both mastery and performance goals (Elliot, 1999; Elliot & McGregor, 2001 ). Masteryapproach goals are focused on attaining task-based or intrapersonal competence, whereas mastery-avoidance goals are focused on avoiding task-based or intrapersonal incompetence. However, there is little research on mastery-avoidance goals. Attaining normative competence, demonstrating high competence, and gaining positive judgments from others is part of performance-approach goals, whereas avoiding normative incompetence and preventing negative judgments from others is part of performance-avoidance goals (Elliot, 1999) .",

                "text": "With respect to the development of achievement goals two strands of theory and research have to be taken into consideration. First, developmental psychologists (Dweck, 2000; Nicholls, 1984 Nicholls, , 1990 have argued that students' mastery goals decrease and students' performance goals increase, primarily as a result of their cognitive development and their concept of ability that becomes increasingly differentiated. Thus, studies by Anderman and Anderman (1999) and Midgley, Anderman, and Hicks (1995) found a decrease in mastery and an increase in performance goals. Second, educational psychologists suggest that middle-level schools can be a major source of a general decline in motivation during early adolescence (Eccles, Lord, Roeser, Barber, & Jozefowicz, 1997; Juvonen, Le, Kaganoff, Augustine, & Constant, 2004) . The changes in classroom organization, instruction, and climate variables could result in a developmental mismatch between early adolescent needs and classroom environment, which may cause a general decline in achievement goals as a motivational outcome (developmental stage-environment fit; Eccles et al., 1993) . Studies by Bong (2009) and Shim et al. (2008) confirmed a general decline in all types of achievement goals. The results of some German studies also lend support to a general decline of achievement goals. Schwinger and Wild (2006) examined subject-specific achievement goal profiles in mathematics from Grade 3 to Grade 5. Their results could not confirm Nicholls' and Dwecks assumptions of a change from mastery to performance goals. Rather, they found a decline in all three types of achievement goals. Finsterwald (2006) also found a decline in all types of achievement goals during the transition from elementary school to secondary school. These results indicate that a decrease in students' achievement goals after transition to secondary school may be predominantly attributed to the transition itself with its concomitant changes in the learning environment rather than to the onset of puberty.",

Mastery goals were more beneficial in the elementary school years (Pekrun, Elliot, & Maier, 2009) ; which finds expression in a positive relation with achievement outcomes, and became less beneficial at the secondary or college level, that is, there were small positive or no relations with achievement outcomes. Conversely, performance-approach goals were less advantageous for achievement in the early school years (e.g., Anderman & Anderman, 1999) and became more advantageous at the secondary or college level (Harackiewicz, Barron, Carter, Lehto, & Elliot, 1997) . In addition, Middleton, Kaplan, and Midgley (2004) concluded that performance-approach goals may be less beneficial or potentially harmful for school achievement in elementary, middle, and high schools as the context is less competitive at those levels compared to the context of college (Middleton & Midgley, 1997) . Bong (2009) , in her study of 1196 Korean students from Grade 1 to Grade 9, found no relation between achievement goals and achievement in Grades 1 and 2 but small positive correlations for mastery goals and small negative correlations for performanceavoidance goals for the higher grades. With respect to performance-approach goals, there was a small positive relation to achievement starting in the upper elementary school (Grades 5 and 6) and the middle school (Grades 7-9). There was no significant correlation for the lower grades. Thus, performance-approach goals did not play a significant role in the early school years.",

Spinath and Sch\u00f6ne (2003) found a positive correlation between mastery goals and school grades and low positive/negative correlations between performance-approach/performance-avoidance goals and school grades. In a longitudinal study with three measurement occasions K\u00f6ller (1998) found higher learning rates -measured with standardized tests -for mastery-goal oriented students than for performance-goal oriented students (Grade 7). Because he used a person-centered approach (Mixed Rasch Model) the results of his study are not fully comparable with other studies that applied a variable-centered approach. Altogether, the majority of the studies support the view that performance goals are less beneficial in elementary school in relation to secondary school.",

Firstly, in most German federal states, the transition to secondary school occurs after Grade 4. Secondly, students are assigned to different secondary school tracks. There is considerable variation across the German states in terms of the number and quality of these tracks (Baumert, Stanat, & Watermann, 2006) , but the tracked system of Hauptschule (lower track), Realschule (middle track), and Gymnasium (upper track) is the best known. Hauptschule is the academically least demanding track; Realschule, the intermediate track; and Gymnasium, the college-bound or academic track. Hauptschule students graduate after Grade 9 or 10 and typically enter the dual system, which combines part-time education at vocational school with on-the-job-training. Realschule students graduate after Grade 10; most of them also enter the dual system, usually aspiring to more skilled occupations (e.g., trade, technical and administrative professions). Gymnasium students graduate after Grade 12 or 13. Passing the final examination (Abitur) is a prerequisite for university entrance. Besides Hauptschule, Realschule, and Gymnasium, some states offer multitrack and comprehensive schools.",

Parents may intervene in the transition process by trying to influence the teacher's recommendation or choosing to go against the recommendation and enrolling their child on another school type, but students must pass an examination or a probationary instruction in order to be accepted into a more demanding school type. Studies showed that the opportunities for access to the different school tracks vary between the different social classes. The opportunity for upper class students to attend the academic track (Gymnasium) is much larger than for lower class students, even after controlling for performance and cognitive abilities (Baumert & Sch\u00fcmer, 2001; Ditton, 2007; Maaz, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, & Baumert, 2008) .",

Compared to elementary school, secondary school is more focused on grades and competition; social comparison processes become more important.

Moreover, because of the higher performance standards -caused by the more demanding curriculum as well as the higher average class ability -and the more pronounced competitive conditions for good grades asking for a demonstration of one's competences, performance-approach goals are expected to become even more important when students transfer to the academic track instead of non-academic tracks.",

The overall motiva-tion of students could decline during the transition to secondary school independent of the school track, because of significant differences between elementary and secondary school. Not only mastery goals, but also performance goals could be affected by these changes.

(2001) further suggested that the consequences of achievement goals may change as the context becomes more competitive. Mastery goals may become less beneficial (no relation to achievement), whereas performance-approach goals may become more beneficial (positive relation to academic achievement). Therefore, Midgley et al. (2001) referred to a study by Harackiewicz et al. (1997) in which a positive relation between performance-approach goals and the final grade in an introductory psychology class was found. They argued that college learning environments are often competitive and performance-oriented, which in turn leads to advantages of performance-approach goals in these settings. Generally, the learning environment of secondary schools can also be described as more performance-oriented and, in some cases, as more competitive compared with the learning environment of elementary schools. Thus, we could expect that performance-approach goals might be slightly more associated with school grades in secondary schools than in elementary schools. Again, performance goals should be more beneficial in the academic-track as compared to non-academic tracks.",

We expect a positive association between mastery-approach goals and school achievement, whereas performance-approach goals might be less beneficial in elementary school and negatively associated with school achievement, the same as performance-avoidance goals. After the transition to secondary school, we expect that mastery goals are still positively associated with school achievement. However, do performance-approach goals lose their detrimental effect and do they predict school achievement positively? 4.

Germany's participation in the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2007 of students at the end of the fourth grade (T1) has provided an ideal opportunity to extend scientific knowledge of how students and their parents cope with the process of transition. As such, two further waves of data collection were undertaken after the transition to secondary school -six months later to coincide with the fifth grade mid-term report card (T2, middle of Grade 5) and one year later to coincide with the final fifth grade report card (T3, beginning of Grade 6).

The sample was clustered as follows: there were 928 students in Gymnasium (academic track); 436 in Realschule (middle track); 158 in Hauptschule (low track); and 124 in schools with combined non-academic educational programs or comprehensive schools. Due to our hypotheses we distinguished between Gymnasium (academic track) on the one side and Realschule, Hauptschule and other school types with combined non-academic educational programs or comprehensive schools (nonacademic track) on the other side. Thus, we combined Realschule, Hauptschule and other non-academic schools to a single group for two reasons. First, because of different enrollment rates there is considerable variation between the German states in the meaning of these different non-academic tracks, e.g., with regard to the student composition (average ability, SES). Hauptschule in some German states is more or less comparable to Realschule in other German states. As we also know from German studies, school types with combined programs and comprehensive schools are more or less comparable to Hauptschule and Realschule (K\u00f6ller, 2003) . Second, in-depth examinations of our data confirmed ignorable differences between the different school types regarding the trajectories of achievement goals. In multi-group analyses we ran latent growth curve models where we fixed the factor loadings as well as the residuals across the groups. The fit statistics for all three models were excellent (mastery-approach goals: v 2 = 13.94, df = 8, RMSEA = .056, CFI = .977, TLI = .974; performance-approach goals: v 2 = 10.41, df = 8, RMSEA = .026, CFI = .991, TLI = .991; performance-avoidance goals: v 2 = 9.27, df = 8, p < .01, RMSEA = .023, CFI = .990, TLI = .992).",

Selectivity analyses revealed that the longitudinal sample was positively selected. Students whose parents selected the academic track (Gymnasium) were overrepresented in the longitudinal sample, while students with parents who selected the low track (Hauptschule) were underrepresented. Furthermore, students in the longitudinal sample had better school grades in Grade 4 (approximately half of a standard deviation), and the socio-economic status of the parents (Parents' Highest International Socioeconomic Index; HISEI) was half of a standard deviation higher on average. In an additional step, a series of two-factor analyses of variance with the school track decision of the parents and the participation in the longitudinal sample as factors, as well as school grades, test scores and social-economic position of the parents as criteria, were conducted. No interaction effect was found, that is, school track decision x participation in the longitudinal sample, indicating that there was a systematic drop-out, but this drop-out did not differ systematically between students based on different school track decisions.",

Therefore we applied a twofold strategy: One the hand we have chosen items from existing instruments (e.g., PALS), that would cover different components of achievement goals and we adapted them to German. On the other hand -where possible -we have chosen items from approved German instruments that have already been applied to students from elementary school. All items were phrased domain-general and scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = very true through 4 = not at all true). The preliminary instrument consisting of twelve items was tested in a field trial. After the elimination of two items the instrument showed an excellent factor structure and the scales were sufficiently reliable and valid. The theoretically assumed factorial structure was confirmed in a study with the same sample that was used in the present study (see Paulick et al., 2011) .",

Following Hulleman et al. 2010, we identified three components of mastery-approach goals: mastering the requirements of the task (two items), improving one's competence, and fulfilling one's potential and learning to as great a degree as possible. Performanceapproach goals were measured using four items (.67 < a < .88) based on the German version of the Motivational Orientation Scales (MOS) (K\u00f6ller & Baumert, 1998 ; original version by Nicholls, Patashnick, & Nolen, 1985) . The items focused on demonstrating high academic competence relative to classmates, for example, ''It is important to me that I know more than other students in my class''. Following Hulleman et al. (2010), we identified two components of performance-approach goals: three normative items (trying to do better than others) and one appearance item (trying to look good to others). Performance-avoidance goals were assessed with two items that were based on items developed by Schwinger and Wild (2006) . The items addressed the focus on avoiding the demonstration of incompetence (appearance component). For example, ''It is important to me that others do not think I am stupid''. Despite the small number of items the internal consistency was quite satisfactorily (.62 < a < .88). All items were reverse coded so that high scores on the final scales indicated high levels of achievement goals (see Appendix for the item list).",

Multiple imputation is a procedure in which missing data are imputed based on the available information (Graham, Cumsille, & Elek-Fisk, 2003) . Five complete data sets were created by filling in a random value for each missing data point. Mplus combines the results for each data set into an average result. Schafer and Olsen (1998) showed that multiple imputation can be used even when the proportion of missing data is rather large. When 30% of the data is missing, an efficiency of 94% can be achieved with already five imputations. Other treatments for missing data (e.g., listwise deletion, mean imputation) can lead to a biased statistical inference (Little & Rubin, 2002) .",

Bollen & Curran, 2006; Duncan, Duncan, & Strycker, 2006; Meredith & Tisak, 1990 ) and compared the different models with each other. LGCM is a tool for analyzing longitudinal data that permits an analysis of change on a latent level whereby random measurement errors are considered. Thus, inter-individual differences of change and different forms of change over time can be taken into account. The slope factor indicates the rate of change per time unit. The interpretation of the slope factor depends on the presumed time function. In a linear growth curve model, a linear growth per time unit is expected. However, this time function is not adequate in every case. In cases, where the growth trend is not known, it can be appropriate to estimate a model with an unspecified growth trend (Meredith & Tisak, 1990) in which the time function is not fixed a priori but is estimated from the data. For each achievement goal, we specified different growth curve models, starting with a linear growth rate and followed by an unspecified (freed-loading LGCM) growth rate (Bollen & Curran, 2006, Chap. 4 ). In the freed-loading LGCM, we fixed the first loading in the slope factor to 0, the third loading to 1, and freely estimated the remaining second loading. The estimated value of the second factor loading indicates the amount of change occurring between measurement occasions one and two relative to the amount of change occurring between measurement occasions two and three. For example, a value of .25 means that the amount of change occurring between occasions one and two is 25%, whereas 75% of the amount of change occurs between occasions two and three. In addition, we imposed equality restrictions on the disturbance terms of the repeated measures. However, as the assumption of homoscedasticity was rejected by our data in most cases, we conducted our baseline models with time-invariant disturbance terms of the repeated measures. To test whether coefficients differed across the different school tracks, we ran multi-group models for academic and nonacademic tracks. To consider the nested structure of the data, we used the command type = general complex. The analyses were computed with the MLR estimator (maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors). As the value of the chi-square statistic tends to increase along with the sample size, we considered approximate fit indices such as the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and the root mean square error of approximation index (RMSEA) for model evaluation. A very good Fig. 1 . A priori model of causal paths between GPAs (GPA) and achievement goals (goal). For clarity, only a general achievement goal factor was pictured (goal) rather than all three types of achievement goals (mastery-approach, performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals). Achievement goals were inferred from four indicators for mastery-approach/performance-approach goals and two indicators from performance-avoidance goals. The double arrow between GPA middle 5 and goal middle 5 represents the covariance between the residuals of GPA middle 5 and goal middle 5. fit is indicated by a value greater than 0.95 for the CFI and TLI and by a value less than 0.06 for the RMSEA (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Yu, 2002) .",

                "text": "To analyze the association between achievement goals and school achievement, we conducted cross-lagged panel models (Kenny, 1975) . With regard to the time points T2 and T3, we used school-track centering for the GPA within the non-academic track to take into account the frame-of-reference effect on grading. Achievement goals were modeled as latent variables, constraining the factor loadings for each pair of repeated measures to be homogeneous over time. In addition, correlated errors have been specified for each pair of repeated measures (Marsh & Yeung, 1997) . The model consisted of 36 path coefficients relating the 12 constructs (nine achievement goals and three GPAs), whereby 15 of these paths were of critical importance: the six paths leading from each achievement goal to the subsequent GPA and the nine paths leading from the GPA to the subsequent achievement goal (see Fig. 1 for a simplified model) . To test whether path coefficients differ across the different school tracks, we ran multi-group models for academic and non-academic tracks. Five different cross-lagged panel models (CLPM) with different constraints were compared. All paths were estimated freely in model 1. In model 2, all autoregressive paths (stability coefficients between T1 and T2 and between T1 and T3) were constrained to be equal across academic and non-academic tracks. In model 3, all paths from previous GPAs to subsequent achievement goals, and in model 4, all paths from previous achievement goals to subsequent GPAs, were set equal across the different school tracks. In model 5, the paths from previous GPAs to subsequent achievement goals, and vice versa, were constrained to be equal across the school tracks. The model comparison was performed by using chi-square difference tests. In all models, we controlled for gender and basic cognitive abilities to ensure that the associations of interest between achievement goals and school achievement as well as differences between the school tracks would not be caused by student\u015b gender or basic cognitive ability level. Studies that included sex and cognitive ability in their analyses showed gender differences in the level of achievement goals. For example, girls preferred mastery goals stronger than boys (Hijzen, Boekaerts, & Vedder, 2006) . Meece and Jones (1996) examined student\u015b achievement goals in science (Grade 5 and 6) and found that differences in self-reports of motivation were more related to student\u015b ability level than to gender. For achievement goals gender differences occurred only for low-ability students: Boys reported a stronger mastery orientation than did girls. There were no gender differences in student\u015b mastery orientation among average-and high-ability students. Table 1 presents means, standard deviations, and internal consistency reliabilities for the three achievement goal scales and the GPAs from T1 to T3 for the academic and non-academic track. The mean level of all types of achievement goals declined from Grade 4 to Grade 6 in both tracks. However, there were some differences in the mean levels across the tracks. Mastery-approach goals differed only slightly across school tracks (Fig. 2) , whereas the mean levels of performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals were higher for non-academic track students (see Figs. 3 and 4). We tested for the significance of the differences in the mean levels of the achievement goals between the school tracks by comparing two models. In model 1, we equated the means between the school tracks while in model 2, we freely estimated the means. Chisquare difference tests revealed significant mean level differences between the school tracks for mastery-approach goals in Grade 4, which was slightly higher for the academic track (results of the v 2 -difference tests: v 2 = 6.55, df = 1, p < .01); track difference was approximately .13 standard deviation. However, the tests did not reveal significant mean level differences for Grades 5 and 6 (Grade Diff = 31.53, df Diff = 1, p < .001), thus indicating lower means for students in the academic track. The means differed by about one third (performance-approach) and one fourth (performance-avoidance) of a standard deviation.",

Moreover, performance goals, especially performance-approach goals, declined much more rapidly than mastery-approach goals during the first half of the school year in secondary school, three-fourths of the change in performance-approach and more than half of the change in performance-avoidance goals occurred. It might be very unlikely that general developmental processes are responsible for the strong decrease of both types of performance goals during the short period directly after the transition.

First, tracking was very explicit in our study, and students were well aware of the track to which they were selected. Second, track membership was based on prior achievement. Although research findings indicate that students from families with a high socioeconomic status are more likely to being placed at Gymnasium than their counterparts from a less favorable family background who perform just as well (Baumert & Sch\u00fcmer, 2001 ), prior achievement level remains the most important predictor of track membership (see also Fig. 5 ). Third, track membership has a direct impact on students' future educational and vocational outcomes. Fourth, the instruction is delivered at higher levels of cognitive activation at Gymnasium and the performance standards are lower in the non-academic school tracks. Despite these differences between both tracks, the shape of the achievement goals trajectories as well as the rate of change was rather similar across the tracks. This indicates that explicit between-school tracking plays a minor role in the development of achievement goals. This is even more noteworthy, considering that other psychosocial characteristics like academic self-concept and intrinsic motivation have shown to be strongly influenced by between-school tracking (Lucas, 1999; Trautwein et al., 2006) . Our third research question referred to the relation between achievement goals and school achievement in elementary school and secondary school. Similar to other studies with students at this age (e.g., Bong, 2009; Lau & Nie, 2008) , we found relatively low correlations between achievement goals and school achievement in elementary school. The highest zero-order correlation we found did not exceed .18. Overall, our hypothesis that mastery-approach goals are positively associated with school achievement was confirmed by our study. On the one hand, results of the cross-lagged panel models suggested that there was a positive relation between mastery-approach goals and school achievement in elementary school. On the other hand, school achievement after the transition to secondary school was predicted by mastery-approach goals. Considering that in our cross-lagged panel analysis we were able to control for prior achievement, other types of achievement goals, gender, and basic cognitive abilities this is a quite noteworthy result. Again, differences between the school tracks in the predictive pattern of mastery-approach goals could not be found. Masteryapproach turned out to be beneficial for learning processes independent from different levels of cognitive activation and the intended curriculum in the classroom.",

This type of achievement goal has shown to be disadvantageous for the achievement of young students. In fact, after the transition to secondary school, school achievement was negatively predicted by performance-approach goals even if only at the academic track. The more performance-approach goal oriented the students were in elementary school, the worse their GPAs later on in secondary school. However, performance-approach goals lost their detrimental effect on learning afterwards. Hence, contrary to our expectations, performance-approach goals did not predict school grades positively after the transition to secondary school. As suggested by Middleton et al. (2004) , we found that performance-approach goals had a negative effect on school achievement as early as elementary school or vice versa, that is, school achievement potentially negatively influenced the adoption of performanceapproach goals. The direction of this relation is empirically rather unclear as we assessed the variables shortly after another. We can confirm, however, that performance-approach goals are negatively associated with academic achievement for young students (Midgley et al., 2001 ).",

Recent studies differentiated between mastery and performance goals and suggested that performance goals (performance-approach and performanceavoidance goals) are domain-general and mastery-approach goals are domain-specific (Bong, 2001; Sparfeldt, Buch, Wirthwein, & Rost, 2007 ).
