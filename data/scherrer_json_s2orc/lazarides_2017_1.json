    "abstract": "This two-wave longitudinal study examined how developmental changes in students' mastery goal orientation, academic effort, and intrinsic motivation were predicted by student-perceived support of motivational support (support for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in secondary classrooms. The study extends previous knowledge that showed that support for motivational support in class is related to students' intrinsic motivation as it focused on the developmental changes of a set of different motivational variables and the relations of these changes to student-perceived motivational support in class. Thus, differential classroom effects on students' motivational development were investigated. A sample of 1088 German students was assessed in the beginning of the school year when students were in grade 8 (Mean age = 13.70, SD = 0.53, 54% girls) and again at the end of the next school year when students were in grade 9. Results of latent change models showed a tendency toward decline in mastery goal orientation and a significant decrease in academic effort from grade 8 to 9. Intrinsic motivation did not decrease significantly across time. Student-perceived support of competence in class predicted the level and change in students' academic effort. The findings emphasized that it is beneficial to create classroom learning environments that enhance students' perceptions of competence in class when aiming to enhance students' academic effort in secondary school classrooms.",

                "text": "Longitudinal research has demonstrated that adolescents' motivation declines consistently across the secondary school years, reaching its nadir in grade 9, with a slight subsequent recovery (Fredricks and Eccles, 2002; Watt, 2004) . According to Eccles et al. (1993) stage-environment fit theory, this motivational decline may be due to a mismatch between the needs of adolescents and the opportunities they are afforded by their classroom learning environments. When aiming to effectively enhance adolescents' academic success, it is therefore critical to examine which classroom characteristics contribute to an adaptive development of adolescents' motivation. In this context, research based on self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, 2002) has shown that student-perceived classroom support for autonomy, competence, and relatedness positively contributes to the adaptive development of students' intrinsic motivation (e.g., Sierens et al., 2009; Jang et al., 2010) . However, only few longitudinal studies investigated how student-perceived classroom characteristics are related simultaneously to the development of motivational variables that reflect the behavioral, cognitive and affective dimensions of students' motivation in secondary school (for exceptions, see Ntoumanis et al., 2009; Wang and Holcombe, 2010; Dietrich et al., 2015) .",

Second, the study extends current knowledge by examining whether and how student-perceived support for autonomy, competence, and relatedness predict these changes in adolescents' motivation. When investigating classroom learning environments, the study focused on students' perceptions of their classrooms as research has emphasized that socialization processes operate through individuals' perceptions of their socializers' behaviors (Eccles et al., 1983) .",

LCMs enable the study of interindividual differences in intraindividual change, because the true intraindividual change is modeled between two measurement points as the value of a latent variable (Steyer et al., 1997) . Positive latent-change scores indicate an increase and negative scores indicate a decrease across time. As described in statistical literature (McArdle, 2009, p. 583) , in order to be able to model the latent change score ( ), we add a set of fixed values (=1) on the specific parameters between a variable value at Time 1 and at Time 2. The change score ( ) is thereby explicitly defined. Furthermore, in order to identify the model, for each of the latent variables, the parameter between their latent change score and their level at Time 2 was set to 1 (see Figure 1 ; McArdle, 2009) .",

To assess the reliability of the aggregated student variables, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were computed for all latent variables in the model (Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002) .

                "text": "Our assumption (Hypothesis 3) that student-perceived support for autonomy, competence and relatedness in class would be related to the level and change of different dimensions of students' motivation was only partly confirmed. The findings of the study showed that only student-perceived support of competence and relatedness in class in grade 8 was significantly associated with students' level of mastery goal orientation, effort, and intrinsic motivation in grade 8. In contrast to previous research (Ciani et al., 2010; Lazarides et al., 2015) , our findings indicated that student-perceived autonomy support was not significantly associated with students' level of mastery goal orientation in grade 8 nor with the change in their mastery goal orientation, academic effort, and intrinsic motivation from grade 8 to grade 9. A possible explanation for this finding might be the fact that the effects of student-perceived autonomy support in class on students' motivation may depend on the structured nature of classroom teaching (Sierens et al., 2009) , perceived competence (Patall et al., 2014 ) and on students' achievement level (Fei-Yin Ng et al., 2004) . Focusing on autonomy-supportive teaching in terms of task choice, Sierens et al. (2009) , for example, showed that student-perceived autonomy support enhanced students' cognitive engagement only at high levels of structure in class. Patall et al. (2014) furthermore demonstrated that only when students felt highly competent on a task, making choices further enhanced their motivation. However, when students felt less competent on a task, task choices diminished perceived intrinsic motivation. Such interaction effects thus may explain the non-significant effects of student-perceived autonomy support on students' motivation in this study and future research should take into account such interdependencies when investigating the relations between student-perceived support of autonomy, competence, and relatedness and students' motivational development in class. Another possible explanation for the non-significant effect of student-perceived autonomy support on students' motivational development may be that this study focused on autonomy-supportive teaching in terms of students' perceptions of possibilities to work independently and to follow their own schedule when working on school-related tasks. However, research based on self-determination theory (Reeve et al., 1999; Reeve, 2002) describes that autonomy-supportive teaching also includes other dimensions of teachers' behaviors, such as the acknowledgment of students' perspectives and the responsiveness to the students' questions. Further studies are needed to examine how different dimensions of autonomy support affect the development of different facets of students' motivation.",

This may be because competence-supportive teaching strategies may enhance students' perceptions of their own competence rather than their enjoyment in learning, whereas high levels of perceived competence may be related to a greater effort and persistence in learning (Eccles and Wigfield, 2002) .",

While it seems to be important to implement competence-enhancing strategies when aiming to increase students' motivation at a behavioral level, the facilitation of supportive relationships with both peers and teachers in secondary school seems to be beneficial when aiming to enhance students' intrinsic motivation. Previous research based on stage-environment fit theory suggested that after the transition to secondary school, students often perceive their teachers as more distant and less supportive than teachers in elementary school (Roeser et al., 1993) . Therefore, in our view, teachers should create a climate of supportiveness in class based on well-being and reciprocal aid (Ruzek et al., 2016) . They should also adopt a teaching style that includes active feedback, which answers students' need for competence support (Niemiec and Ryan, 2009) .",

To validate the findings of this study, future research should include teacher reports of classroom characteristics or external observer ratings (Holzberger et al., 2013; Praetorius et al., 2014) . However, previous studies that focused on students' motivation have shown that teacher and student self-reports were not highly correlated (see Skinner and Belmont, 1993; Wentzel et al., 2010) and that, compared to teacher reports, students' reports of their classroom characteristics more strongly predicted the development of students' motivation (Clausen, 2002) .",
