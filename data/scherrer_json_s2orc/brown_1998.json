    "abstract": "We examined changes in self-esteem and feelings of competence with physical appearance and social acceptance over approximately 5 years in 1166 white and 1213 black girls, aged 9 and 10 years at baseline. Methods: Maturation stage and body mass index (BMI) were assessed annually. Biennially girls completed Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Children. Changes were analyzed in the context of race, sexual maturation, BMI, and household income. Longitudinal regression models were used to compare trends with age in global selfworth, physical appearance, and social acceptance. Results: Mean global self-worth showed little change over ages 9-14 years in blacks (p 5 0.09) but decreased in whites (p < 0.001). Mean physical appearance scores for both races declined between ages 9 and 14 years (blacks, p < 0.001; whites, p < 0.001). Mean social acceptance scores increased for both races between ages 9 and 14 years (blacks, p < 0.001; whites, p < 0.001). For all three scores, these changes differed between blacks and whites changes with age in global self-worth and physical appearance scores. Self-worth, physical appearance, and social acceptance scores decreased with increasing BMI. Decreases in physical appearance and social acceptance scores with increasing BMI were smaller in blacks than in whites (p < 0.05). After adjustment for maturation stage and household income, racial differences in social acceptance scores depended on BMI (p < 0.05) but not on age (p 5 0.08). Conclusions: This article reports the first data on selfesteem scores by age for a large population of black girls aged 9 and 14 years and concludes that self-esteem does not follow the same developmental pattern in black as in white girls. A reason for black girls' higher and more stable self-worth and their greater satisfaction with their physical appearance compared to white girls may be racial differences in attitudes toward physical appearance and obesity.",

Several longitudinal studies of agerelated changes in mean levels of self-esteem have found, for boys and girls combined, small, gradual increases in measures of self-esteem during adolescence (2) . However, when cross-sectional, age-related differences in self-esteem by gender were studied by Simmons and Rosenberg (3) in a large sample (N = 1988) of Baltimore school children from Grades 3-12, and when Blyth et al. (4) studied longitudinal changes in 6th to 10th graders, both found that self-esteem in girls fell while self-esteem in boys rose during adolescence. In a small longitudinal study of 47 girls and 44 boys at ages 14, 18, and 23 years, Block and Robins (5) found that boys had higher selfesteem scores than girls at every age. Self-esteem tended to increase in boys and decrease in girls over time.",

Block and Robins (5) tested for the effects of race and gender on selfesteem in their sample, which was two-thirds white and one-fourth black. There were no ethnic or social class differences in self-esteem, perhaps because the small sample size limited their ability to detect differences or because most of the age-related decline in white girls' self-esteem had already taken place by age 14 years. Simmons and Rosenberg (3) studied racial differences in self-esteem by gender and age in their larger, cross-sectional sample, which was 63% black. The effects of gender and age on self-esteem were quite different among whites compared to blacks. In late adolescence in particular, white girls showed significantly lower self-esteem than white boys or black girls (51% of white girls and 25% of white boys had low self-esteem). For black children in late adolescence, there was no comparable sharp increase in the gender difference in self-esteem (16% of black girls and 14% of black boys had low selfesteem). These findings did not disappear after adjusting for household income.",

The profile was designed to tap children's domain-specific judgments of their competence, as well as an independent global perception of their worth or esteem as a person. The profile was administered to NGHS participants at baseline and biennially thereafter. Scores for the three scales ranged from 1.00 to 4.00 and were computed according to procedures detailed in the Manual for the Self-Perception Profile for Children (8) . Raw profile scores were used in analyses. Reliability coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) were computed for each of the three scales by race and visit.

Harter (1) reported that satisfaction with physical appearance was consistently related to global selfworth at a moderately high level in four samples of white children in Grades 4 -8 (r = 0.62-0.73). The largest differences in global self-worth and physical appearance scores among white middle school children were by gender. Compared to white girls, white boys rated themselves as more attractive and liked themselves better. Social acceptance scores were moderately related to self-worth (r = 0.41-0.58) and to physical appearance scores (r = 0.29 -0.51). Other cross-sectional studies (13, 14) have related physical attractiveness to more general adolescent personality and social functioning among white adolescents. They concluded that young adolescents who were considered physically attractive were also highly rated on other desirable personal and behavioral characteristics (13, 14) . This article contributes new information by presenting evidence for a similar relationship of physical appearance and social acceptance scores to self-worth scores in black adolescent girls. We have also shown that physical appearance scores in NGHS girls followed a developmental pattern similar to that observed with global selfworth scores. However, black-white differences in physical appearance scores were larger than differences in self-worth, appeared at an earlier age, and depended on both girls' age and their BMI (p < 0.001). This suggests that the cognitive ability to generalize about global self-feelings and attributes may be limited in younger girls (8) . For very young girls, physical appearance may be a less abstract and more easily understood personal characteristic than global self-worth.",

Our results have confirmed earlier work showing the negligible effect of biological puberty alone on changes in self-esteem (19) . A possible explanation for declines in white girls' self-worth, physical appearance, and social acceptance scores based on pubertal timing (20, 21) was also eliminated by adjusting for BMI. The complex issue of pubertal timing and its relationship to self-esteem and BMI in NGHS girls is the subject of another manuscript now in preparation. Informed speculation on the social and psychological reasons for reported declines in selfesteem among adolescent white girls has emphasized the importance of girls' sex-role and physical appearance attitudes, and their relationships with family and peers. In 1975, Simmons (3) suggested that white girls were more likely than black girls to grow up in a male-headed household; valued marriage more than black girls; placed a higher priority on being well liked, especially by boys; and cared more about their physical appearance, but were less satisfied with their looks than black girls. More recent discussions of the determinants of white girls' self-esteem (5, 16, 18, 22) have refocused attention on stereotyped female sex-role expectations that women should be more interpersonally oriented and more physically beautiful than men. For women, unlike men, the task of identity development results in the formation of important relationships, rather than in separation and independence. Physical attractiveness contributes to the success of this style of development (18, 23) . Further investigations are needed of the sex-role attitudes and expectations associated with low self-esteem among white girls, how they are learned, and the role of mass media in the process.",

In 1973, Simmons (24) concluded that declines in global self-esteem for the 1917 boys and girls in her sample (63% black) in Grades 3-12 were confined to early adolescence with some improvement after age 15 years. It should be noted, however, that Simmons' analyses were not carried out by gender or race, that a second measure of self-esteem based on eight specific areas of competence yielded contradictory results, and that estimates of age trends in her cross-sectional design were biased by the loss of data from school dropouts among older adolescents. Subsequent evidence on changes in white girls' self-esteem after age 14 years has been inconclusive. Declines until age 18 years (25) and until age 23 years (5) have been reported. Analysis of NGHS follow-up data on girls from ages 15-19 years may help to answer questions about the duration of this decline and the impact of demographic factors and life transitions on older adolescent girls.",

In 1975, Simmons (3) suggested that the self-esteem of adolescent black girls in her sample was higher and more stable than that of white girls because the positions of the sexes differs among blacks and whites. In black families, sex roles appear to be more flexible (26) . Simmons also suggested that the higher level of self-esteem in black girls might be associated with racial differences in family structure and female role models, i.e., the greater tendency for black girls to grow up in female-headed households with mothers who work full time. It seems clear that investigations of the effect of family structure, maternal role models, and sex-role expectations on self-esteem within the black community are needed.",

Physical appearance scores for black girls, compared to white girls, declined less as their BMI increased. Other analyses of the NGHS cohort have also shown racial differences in attitudes toward physical appearance and obesity. Black girls at ages 9 and 10 years were more satisfied with their body build and appearance than whites regardless of their BMI (p < 0.001). Their preferred body build and expected adult body size were significantly larger than those of NGHS white girls (p < 0.001) (27) . Other authors have suggested that support for black girls' body build preferences may be found in subcultural expectations and ideals regarding black womens' appearance and behavior (28, 29) . These differing standards for acceptable body size in black compared to white girls could have important public health implications if they are directly linked to the greater prevalence of obesity and obesity-related disease (diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and coronary disease) seen in black compared to white adult women (30 -32) . Future analyses should go beyond longitudinal descriptions to address hypothesized relationships between Self-Perception Profile scores, dietary intake, and eating behaviors in black and white adolescent girls.",
