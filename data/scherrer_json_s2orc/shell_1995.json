    "abstract": "This study examined grade-and achievement-level differences in 4th-, 7th-, and lOth-grade students' control-related beliefs and relations between students' beliefs and their reading and writing achievement. MANOVA results indicated grade-and achievement-level differences in self-efficacy, causal attribution, and outcome expectancy beliefs but no interaction between grade and achievement level. Canonical correlations identified a single dimension linking students' beliefs to achievement in both reading and writing. Quadratic relations to achievement were found for outcome expectancy and intelligence attributions. As grade increased, beliefs for reading were more highly related to comprehension skill relative to component skills, whereas beliefs for writing were more highly related to component skills relative to communication skills. At all achievement levels, a similar pattern of beliefs was related to achievement. People's beliefs about their abilities to exercise personal control of important events in their lives are thought to play a major role in motivating the self-regulation of cognitive performance and learning (see Bandura, 1986; Schunk, 1991; Weiner, 1985; Zimmerman, 1989). Three particular control-related beliefs have received extensive theoretical formulation and empirical examination: (a) self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986; Schunk, 1991; Zimmerman, 1989), defined as confidence in one's capability for organizing and implementing the cognitive, behavioral, or social skills necessary for successful performance of a task; (b) causal attributions (Weiner, 1985), defined as one's judgments about the causality of success or failure in achievement situations; and (c) outcome expectancy (Bandura, 1986; Schunk, 1991), defined as beliefs about the contingencies between one's successful task performance and possible outcomes or the expectation that a behavior will result in particular outcomes. These beliefs are thought to play a foundational role in motivating behavior for tasks that require high levels of personal self-initiation and active self-regulation (see Bandura, 1986; Schunk, 1991; Zimmerman, 1989).

Young children commonly (a) have inaccurate perceptions of causality (e.g., Stipek, 1993; Weiner, 1985) , (b) overestimate the contingency between their behaviors and outcomes (Stipek, 1993) , and (c) overstate their self-efficacy or ability (Paris & Oka, 1986; Stipek, 1993) . Also, as children age, their beliefs increase in accuracy (Paris & Oka, 1986; Stipek, 1993) . A particularly salient change in causal attributions has been identified. Young children tend to equate effort and ability as causes, whereas older children tend to see effort and ability as inversely related (e.g., Stipek, 1993; Weiner, 1985) . As a result, young children tend to attribute success to effort more than do older children (Stipek, 1993) .",

Because increased achievement is often associated with increasing age, particularly for subjects studied in school, achievement-related differences potentially could be an artifact of developmental differences. Conversely, developmental differences could be an artifact of increased competency as knowledge and skills are mastered. Studies have found independent effects for development and achievement on beliefs, however, suggesting that differences related to development are distinct from those related to achievement (e.g., Hiebert et al., 1984; Paris & Oka, 1986) . Even if development and achievement have independent effects on beliefs, they still may interact. Hiebert et al. (1984) found that high-achieving third graders were more similar in causal attribution patterns to sixth graders than to their low-achieving peers, and Paris and Oka (1986) identified different regression equations for students of different ability levels across grade levels. These findings suggest possible interactions between development and achievement; however, there has been little direct empirical examination of possible interactions.",

Also, few studies (e.g., Schunk & Swartz, 1993) have examined children's beliefs about writing. As a result, developmental or achievement-level differences in children's beliefs about writing have not been systematically examined. Studies examining adult, skilled participants have found that beliefs are less strongly related to achievement for writing than for reading (McCarthy et al., 1985; Shell et al., 1989) ; however, how this difference in the strength of the relations for reading and writing develops and whether this difference also occurs for persons at other achievement levels presently are not known.",

(1989) . First, they found that for adult, skilled participants, there was a single canonical dimension linking beliefs to reading and writing achievement. This indicated generalized, reciprocal relations between beliefs and achievement across the two domains. Shell et al.'s findings are consistent with studies showing that reading and writing component skills are reciprocally related and exert generalized influences on each other's development (e.g., Shanahan, 1984; Shanahan & Lomax, 1986) . These generalized, reciprocal relations across the two domains potentially could influence the development of the relations between beliefs and reading and writing achievement. Also, they could be different for children at different levels of achievement. No studies, however, have examined generalized relations across the two domains with children at different ages or with persons at different levels of achievement. Second, Shell et al. (1989) found that for adult, skilled readers and writers, outcome expectancy had a quadratic curvilinear relation to reading and writing achievement. When curvilinearity is present, an exclusively linear model underestimates correlations. Therefore, if curvilinearity also exists in the relations between beliefs and achievement for children at different ages and achievement levels, previous studies that examined only linear relations (e.g., Ehrlich et al., 1993; Paris & Oka, 1986; Wagner et al., 1989) may have drawn inaccurate conclusions about the comparative strengths of the relations between self-efficacy, causal attributions, and outcome expectancy and reading or writing achievement. No examinations of curvilinearity, however, have been done with children of different ages or achievement levels.",

Also, redundancy analysis (Pedhazur, 1982) indicated that the second canonical correlation accounted for no meaningful, nonredundant variance in the set of achievement variables.

Also, attributions to intelligence for both reading and writing and to teacher help for reading did not contribute as strongly in 7th grade as in either 10th or 4th grade.

These beliefs have received the most emphasis in discussions of developmental change in causal attributions (e.g., see Stipek, 1993; Weiner, 1985) , and our findings substantiate that the changes in causal beliefs that occur in the late elementary grades primarily involve changes in perceptions of the importance of effort and intelligence or ability. For both effort and intelligence, the ratings of their importance were lower for 7th than for 4th graders. These results are consistent with those of previous studies (e.g., see Hiebert et al., 1984; Stipek, 1993) . Decreases in children's attribution to effort and ability have been interpreted as indicating that these beliefs become more accurate as children age because the high ratings younger children give to these causes are thought to overstate their likely actual causal influence (e.g., see discussion in Stipek, 1993) .

Our findings support Bandura's claim, because the grade-level increase in task self-efficacy through high school mirrored a grade-level increase in students' actual reading and writing skills (Table 1 ). Interestingly, gradelevel differences occurred only for task self-efficacy; the scores for component skills self-efficacy were basically the same in each grade.

Low achievers, however, simultaneously ascribed causal influence to a greater number of external and uncontrollable causes. These findings suggest that low achievers may have a more contingent causality for effort. In essence, effort will cause success if \"the task is easy enough,\" \"I receive enough help,\" \"I am lucky,\" or \"I am smart enough.\" If any of these other causal conditions are not met, the positive effects of attribution to effort could be undermined. As Stipek (1993) notes, this contingent causality may, in fact, be real for low achievers, because they tend to experience more tasks that are beyond their reading and writing skill level and may receive more teacher help. Thus, effort may not help these students succeed unless other conditions are met. This suggests that to maintain positive attributions to effort and positive motivation among low achievers, reading and writing tasks need to be structured so that low achievers can achieve success through their efforts.",

The pervasiveness of these findings across grade and achievement levels suggests that this dimensionality is a fundamental property of the relations between beliefs and achievement in reading and writing. This indicates that consideration of possible reciprocal influences from beliefs in both domains will be necessary for full understanding of the motivational influences of beliefs on reading or writing.

Only at moderate levels do there appear to be positive contributions from these beliefs. This suggests caution in how attributional and outcome expectancy feedback are delivered in classrooms. Feedback that over-or understresses either the importance of intelligence in student achievement or the contingencies between reading and writing and the attainment of life goals may have negative motivational and achievement consequences. These findings also suggest that previous studies, in which only linear relations were examined (e.g., Ehrlich et al., 1993; Mc-Carthy et al., 1985; Paris & Oka, 1986) , have likely underestimated the contributions of these beliefs to explaining variance in achievement.",

In all three grades, beliefs accounted for similar amounts of variance in achievement (Table 3) . Also, although there were some differences in the magnitudes of the loadings for specific beliefs, in all grades the overall structures of the canonical dimension for beliefs were similar. Higher achievement was associated with higher selfefficacy, lower attribution to external causes, and the curvilinear patterns of attribution to intelligence and outcome expectancy.

For example, except for special remedial classes, there are no courses devoted to teaching reading per se, and students do not practice specific reading subskills in their courses. Student reading is done primarily in subject matter classes for the purpose of learning. However, there still may be courses in writing, such as composition or creative writing, that include writing skill components. Also, in addition to comments on content, teacher feedback on students' written work is likely to include comments about spelling, mechanics such as punctuation and grammar, and proper word use or phrasing, and these may compose a substantial part of students' grades. Thus, even in high school, students may continue to hold a view of good writing that includes an emphasis on component skill proficiency. This would account for their beliefs about writing being more related to component subskills relative to higher order communication skill.

As suggested by high achievers' lower ratings of outcome expectancy (Table 2) , this type of tool or utility value may be less important for high achievers than other more intrinsic motivations. It seems reasonable that persons who read or write very well would be more likely to derive intrinsic satisfaction from these activities or derive intrinsic motivation from their competency (see Stipek, 1993 , for a complete discussion of these topics). Thus, the attainment of other outcomes may be less motivating for high achievers, although more study is clearly needed to substantiate this speculation.",

The next research step needs to be examination of how beliefs affect the cognitive processes that are causally related to achievement. Schunk and Swartz (1993) and Schunk and Rice (1991) have found that self-efficacy is associated with the use of specific reading and writing strategies. Their research, however, constitutes only a beginning of this examination. Also, because self-efficacy, causal attribution, and outcome expectancy beliefs presumably exert their influence by affecting motivation (e.g., see Bandura, 1986; Schunk, 1991; Stipek, 1993; Weiner, 1985; Zimmerman, 1989) , there is a need to examine more directly how beliefs relate to measures of motivation such as effort and persistence and how these motivational influences subsequently affect and are themselves affected by the strategies and knowledge used during reading and writing. Finally, there are additional beliefs (e.g., see Schunk, 1991; Stipek, 1993) , such as goals for reading and writing or attributions to factors such as strategy use, that need to be examined and integrated with those considered in our study.",
