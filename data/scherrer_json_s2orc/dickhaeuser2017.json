In order to evaluate a specific result of a student's work on a task as good or poor, teachers (as well as all other evaluators) need reference norms as evaluation standards.

When evaluating students' achievements, teachers are not always free to choose the one or another reference norm. For example, when grading students' results on a test, teachers mainly are asked to take into account whether the results document students' mastery http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/pdf/10.1024/1010-0652/a000208 -Friday, September 15, 2017 2:41:55 AM -Universit\u00e4t Trier IP Address:136.199.84.94 (i. e., teachers should prefer a criterial reference norm). In contrast, if a teacher is asked to designate students for a specific scholarship, he or she is typically restricted to applying a social reference norm (as only a predefined number of students can be nominated). However, many situations occur throughout the school day where teachers evaluate students' achievement without being restricted to apply a specific reference norm. When a teacher, for example, gives students individual feedback on the quality of their answers during in-class discussions, when a teacher talks to a student about his or her achievement after the end of the school day, or when teachers write comments under a graded test, the teachers are free to base their feedback to a specific degree on a specific reference norm. These preferences for specific reference norms within such situations have been called reference norm orientation (RNO) (Rheinberg, 1980) . Most research (with few exceptions, e. g., Elliot, Murayama, & Pekrun, 2011) has tended to focus on interpersonal preferences with respect to social and temporal reference norms (Retelsdorf & G\u00fcnther, 2011) . 1 This seems adequate since individuals may be likely to agree on the importance of absolute criteria but differ in their valuation of social and temporal comparisons. Even though evaluation of students' achievement often may be based on a combination of different reference norms (Rheinberg, 1980) , there are differences between teachers in their preference for temporal and social reference norms. The present study focuses on effects of such preferences on students' motivational development.",

The second approach uses external observers, who answer questions on the teachers' frame of reference after observing them (e. g., L\u00fcdtke et al., 2005) . The third approach uses student ratings of teachers' reference norm orientations (e. g., Gl\u00e4ser-Zikuda & Fu\u00df, 2008) ; in order to have a measure representing the contextual effects within one class, students' individual ratings usually are aggregated on the classroom level. However, from a social-constructive view of contextual effects on individual behavior and cognition, it is often argued that students' individual perceptions (which are inherently subjective and frequently deviate from the shared perceptions) are at least of similar relevance as the aggregated ratings at the classroom level (e. g., Martin, Bobis, Anderson, Way, & Vellar, 2011) .",

Social reference norms have also been labeled as \"external frames of reference,\" \"normative or interpersonal evaluation standard,\" and temporal reference norms have been labeled as \"internal frames of reference\" or \"intrapersonal evaluation standards\" (see, e. g., Elliot & McGregor, 2001; Marsh, 1986; Rheinberg, 1980) . However, for the sake of preciseness, we prefer the terms \"social reference norm\" and \"temporal reference norm\" throughout this paper. In our view, the term \"external frame of reference\" does not exclusively refer to social comparisons since, for example, criterial references (i. e., references to an absolute standard within the given task) are also external comparisons (i. e., comparisons of a result with a standard outside the individual). In addition, in our view, the terms \"internal frame of reference\" or \"intrapersonal evaluation standard\" do not exclusively refer to temporal comparisons, seeing that dimensional references (i. e., references to one's own results in other domains) are also internal or intrapersonal comparisons (see also M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001 ).",

Teachers' reference norm orientations are associated with the achievement expectations teachers develop about their students and their attributions about students' achievement: TO is associated with rather short-term, fluctuating expec tations and unstable attributions, whereas SO is associated with long-term, stable expectations and stable attributions about students' performance. These differences in teachers' expectations and attributions of students' performance can be assumed to be mainly grounded in different assumptions on the stability of performance within the classroom. Rheinberg (1980) argued that a higher (compared to a lower) TO makes teachers perceive the performance pattern within the classroom as rather unstable (since individual improvements as well as decreases are likely to appear), whereas a higher (compared to a lower) SO makes teachers perceive the performance pattern within the classroom to be rather stable (since rank orders within a classroom typically do not change, even if all students improve).",

The higher teachers' SO is, on the other hand, the more they tend to praise students for being better and criticize them for being worse than others. Therefore, the likelihood of performance-related praise and criticism more closely depends on students' achievement rank order within the classroom, the higher the teachers' SO is. This line of argument results in the core prediction that the effects of SO on students' motivation are likely to depend on students' prior achievement, while the effects of TO should be independent of students' prior achievement rank. In addition, given the fact that students' competencies usually increase over time (as a result of learning), praise becomes more likely than criticism when the teacher adopts a TO.",

Both students' self-concept (e. g., Dweck, 1986; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) as well as their implicit theory of abilities (Burnette, O'Boyle, VanEpps, Pollack, & Finkel, 2013 , for a recent meta-analysis) have been assumed and demonstrated to be determinants of their beliefs and their behavior, each having specific effects. Based on work by Dweck (1986) and Mueller and Dweck (1998) , we assume that being judged under a TO (which is often associated with effort-related feedback; see Rheinberg 1980) makes students develop a more incremental theory of intelligence and a higher self-concept, whereas being judged under a SO (which is often associated with ability-related feedback; again see Rheinberg, 1980) should lead to a more entitist view of intelligence and lower self-concepts. This should result from feedback based on a TO (compared to feedback based on a SO), which more clearly illustrates to students that abilities develop as a function of invested effort, and that, in a learning context like the school, competencies typically increase as a function of learning.",

The development of motivational beliefs was different depending on the type of comments the students had received and the level of their prior performance. Comments based on a social reference norm were differently related to students' expectations of improvement depending on students' prior level of performance: Students who performed poorly at the beginning developed a clearly lower expectation of improvement compared to students who had an intermediate performance. Interestingly, this difference between low-and medium-performing students was not as marked given temporal comments. In addition, comments based on a social reference norm were associated with marked differences in students' graded performance depending on students' previous performance while this difference was less pronounced given temporal comments.",

The BFLP is mainly the result of social comparison processes within the classroom and describes the finding that, even though achievement positively predicts individual self-concepts at the individual level, classroom level achievement has a negative effect on individual self-concepts. The authors reported results from a 1-year longitudinal study in mathematics classrooms based on a sample of 2,150 students from 112 classes. As a measure for teachers' reference norm orientations, they used students' and observers' ratings of the teachers' TO (a measure that is logically and theoretically independent from teachers' SO). TO was associated with enhanced self-concepts at time 2 (grade 8). However, the authors did not find any support for the idea that teachers' reference norm orientations moderated the strength of the BFLP. In line with our argumentation, this may be because a measure of teachers' TO does not provide valid information about teachers' SO.",

The statistical analyses must take the hierarchical nature of data into account. Second, the effect of TO and SO must be disentangled, as TO and SO do not constitute two opposite poles of one single construct. Third, research should more thoroughly consider how the potential positive or negative effects of TO and SO are moderated by students' prior achievement (as indicated by grades).

A strong SO of the mathematical teachers was, as expected, especially harmful to students with poorer prior achievements -who had already started with a rather negative self-concept that was additionally impaired by the social comparisons carried out by their teachers (Figure 2) . In contrast, students with good prior achievements were not harmed by a strong SO of their teachers, though they also did not benefit from extensive social comparisons of their teachers. The expected moderation effect was evident for students' self-concept but not for their implicit theories. Consistent with our assumptions, we observed no moderation effect for teachers' TO. 2",

This negative trend is in line with findings documenting negative developments after the transition from elementary to secondary school (see Anderman & Maehr, 1994 , for a review).

A higher (compared to a lower) temporal reference norm orientation at the shared class level was associated with a less steep decline in students' mathematical selfconcept and their implicit theory. In contrast, a higher (compared to a lower) social reference norm orientation at the class level was associated with a steeper decline in students' mathematical self-concept and their implicit theory. We interpret these findings as a clear reference that teachers' reference norm orientations (indicated by the shared perception of students within a class) are a significant contextual factor influencing motivational development. This assumption is supported by the fact that the effects of TO and SO at the shared class level (which are frequently seen as mostly relevant when analyzing contextual effects; Marsh et al., 2012) were consistently in the predicted direction and were statistically significant (the effects of TO and SO at the individual level were generally consistent with this pattern). As can be seen from the Figure 1 and from the coefficients for the slope as outcome model in Table 3 , the TO effects seem to be more pronounced than the SO effects. This may be due to the fact that SO feedback -compared to TO feedback -is overall more likely to be negative, so that SO feedback may more often be reinterpreted in order to immunize the self (Greve & Wentura, 2003) .",

Even though both constructs have been assumed and demonstrated to be core motivational constructs, they only rarely were related to teachers' reference norm orientations. Interestingly, there have been only very few studies at all that tested potential determinants of students' implicit theories. We are aware of only three studies that have attempted to directly test determinants of implicit theories: The study by Spinath, Spinath, Angleitner, and Riemann (2003) demonstrated that implicit theories are unrelated to personality and actual intelligence. Using an experimental design, Mueller and Dweck (1998) found that students' implicit theories depend on the type of successrelated feedback they receive: Ability-related praise was associated with a rather entitist view on intelligence, whereas effort-related feedback was associated with a more incremental view on intelligence. Dresel and Ziegler (2006) , who also adopted an experimental approach, additionally demonstrated that attributional feedback provided in a sequence that implies that effort leads to improved abilities fosters an incremental theory. In line with research on teachers' reference norm orientation, it would be reasonable to assume that teachers' attributions of students' achievement to stable factors (which are typical for high SO) share an entitist view whereas teachers' attributions to instable factors (which are typical for high TO) shape an incremental view of intelligence. Even though the present study does not give an answer concerning the exact process leading to an incremental view of abilities, it is one of the very few studies to empirically prove determinants of students' implicit theories.",

This theoretical reasoning is supported by the finding that TO and SO were only weakly related at best, and in the present study both at the individual and at the classroom level. The findings of the present study underline the necessity to separate these different forms of reference-norm orientations. As can be deduced from theoretical reasoning on teachers' reference-norm orientations, the potential negative effects of SO can be as-sumed to be moderated by students' prior achievement level, whereas the positive effects of TO should occur independent from achievement level. This prediction is based on the fact that achievement feedback on the basis on SO clearly depends on students' achievement range within the classroom (with a higher chance for positive feedback for students with achievement ranks above classroom average), whereas TO effects should be independent of students' prior achievement position (a positive feedback as the result of individual improvement is independent from students' achievement rank).",

This moderation was only predicted and found for SO; the positive effects on TO were not influenced by students' achievement level. For the second dependent variable, students' implicit theory, the predicted moderation was not supported. As pointed out in the theory section, teachers with a pronounced SO are less sensitive to changes in students' achievement. Probably because of this lower sensitivity, they signal their students that performance and the underlying factors (such as ability) are stable (see Rheinberg, 1980) and therefore unchangeable. As the lower sensitivity to changes of teachers with a higher SO exists independently of students prior achievement, this may be one explanation for the lacking moderation of the SO effect on students' implicit theory.",

This is due to the fact that individuals are sensitive to change, but may adapt to new situations over the long run (Bless & Burger, 2016) . However, it is hard to estimate the period of time after which such an adaptation process might result in attenuated effects. In the present study, significant effects of teachers TO and SO could be observed even over a period of 2 years.",

Because test scores are typically not subject to direct communication, we would not expect that the moderation between teachers' social reference norm orientation and students' prior achievement on students' self-concept would have been found if we had chosen test scores to operationalize student's prior achievement.",

In contrast, we cautiously investigated only one specific aspect of teachers, namely, teachers' reference norm orientation. This focus leads to the fact that the class-specific variations of students' self-concepts and their implicit theory cannot fully be explained. At the same time, the focus on teachers' preferences for temporal and social reference norms also leads to the practical recommendations regarding best teaching practices being very concise. Even though teachers' reference norm orientations have not been intensively studied throughout the international research community, the present investigation underlines that teachers' reference norm orientations are a fruitful concept, both from a theoretical and from a practical perspective.",
