The SGRCE model forms the nexus for the collection of reports in this volume; each group of authors looked at their data through the lens this model provides. The model describes parenting and socialization influences on the development of ethnic identity and self-esteem and the subsequent influences of the latter on academic achievement. With our data, we were able to examine the second set of links in this model -from self-esteem and ethnic identity to achievement; we were also able to expand the model to include mediators that may help explain the mechanisms behind these links. Below we provide an overview of the components of the model and describe of how we have adapted and expanded the SGRCE model for our study of academic performance among American Indian students.",

Healthy self-esteem has been associated with internal locus of control, perceptions of competence, persistence in the face of challenges, coping skills, social support, and a variety of other qualities that are likely to better equip students to succeed in school (Donnellan, Trzesniewski, Conger, & Conger, 2007; DuBois & Flay, 2004; Haney & Durlak, 1998; Koch, 2006; Swann, Chang-Schneider, & McClarty, 2007) . However, while the relationship between self-esteem and achievement is well established, the nature of the link remains a matter of considerable debate. Cross-sectional research has consistently found correlations between selfesteem and academic success (Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs, 2003; Hansford & Hattie, 1982; Tice & Gailliot, 2006) . More recent longitudinal investigations of the link between self-esteem and academic achievement have found as much indication that achievement enhances self-esteem as they have that self-esteem enhances achievement. Some have suggested that no real causal relationship exists between these constructs in either direction, but rather that the bidirectional nature of the effects indicates that other variablessuch as IQ or socioeconomic status -explain their shared variance (Baumeister et al., 2003) .",

We were particularly concerned with how engagement with American Indian culture might be related to academic success. This emphasis derived from suggestions that the root of achievement deficits evident among many American Indian students may lie in their disengagement from their traditional cultures (Henze & Vanett, 1993; Powers, 2006; Whitbeck, Hoyt, Stubben, & LaFromboise, 2001) . It has been suggested that re-emphasis on involvement with American Indian culture might provide a variety of resources -clear cultural values, sense of community, validation of self, etc. -that would enhance school success. If cultural engagement is, in fact, related to achievement, then students who are more identified with their tribal cultures should perform better in school than those who are relatively disengaged. In order to explore this possibility, we assessed cultural identity, specifically operationalized as American Indian identity, the extent to which adolescents adopted an identity as American Indian and participated in practices, traditions, and spiritual beliefs resonant with tribal culture (Oetting & Beauvais, 1990-91) .",

While we thought strong cultural identity would foster academic success among American Indian adolescents, as it has been shown to do in other populations, we also thought the relationship might be more complex. Students with high American Indian identity might actually reject academic goals as not consistent with traditional American Indian ways. The educational history of American Indian tribes is distinct from that of other ethnic minority groups in the U.S. The forced acculturation of tribal children through western education, particularly in boarding schools, has left scars on tribal communities, in many cases undercutting tribal culture in critical ways (as was the intention of these educational policies). Despite dramatic changes in the educational systems for Native children in recent decades, distrust of western education remains in many Native communities, particularly among those who are most strongly committed to preserving and restoring tribal culture. Thus, the self-assurance and perseverance likely to emerge from strong cultural identity -characteristics that would be expected to enhance academic achievement -might instead, in the context of the cultural values inherent in that identity, lead American Indian students to reject mainstream academic goals in favor of goals more consonant with their tribal identity. Thus, the picture of the relationship between cultural identity and academic success that emerges may be more complex than suggested by the SGRCE model.",

In doing so we were concerned with determining not only whether or not the hypothesized relationships existed, but also why they existed. In other words, if selfesteem is predictive of academic performance -why is it? If cultural identity relates to higher levels of achievement, how does it do so? We were interested in the mechanisms of these relationships. As suggested above, we do not believe that self-esteem per se leads to better grades or that cultural identity in itself would make students more successful, but rather that both of these aspects of self-concept -when healthy -support other characteristics that, in turn, make it more likely that students will succeed in school. Thus, we proposed a mediational model, with two potential mediators -personal resources and problem behaviors. Both cultural identity and self-esteem were expected to serve promotive and protective roles, nurturing the development of personal resources that support achievement and thwarting engagement in problem behaviors that undermine it. Our conceptual model is shown in Figure 1 ; the longitudinal nature of our data is indicated by the arrangement of model elements across six waves of data. As is also evident in Figure 1 , we used latent growth curve modeling techniques to fit growth trajectories of self-esteem and American Indian identity across all six waves and then modeled these trajectories as predictors of academic success in the final wave (W6). Included in the model were mediators, personal resources and problem behaviors, in the penultimate wave of data collection (W5). We also controlled for academic performance, resources, and behavior problems at the first wave, in order to distinguish the effects of each of these factors on trajectories of self-esteem and cultural identity from the effects of trajectories on subsequent resources, problems, and academic success. For clarity in Figure 1 we do not include all the individual paths tested in our data analyses; rather, the shaded arrows in the model represent the flow of relationships across time (i.e., trajectories to mediators to outcome).",

Both self-esteem and cultural identity were hypothesized to promote the development of a variety of personal resources that would, in turn, equip adolescents to approach academic tasks with confidence and, thus, to succeed. This is consistent with suggestions by many others that general psychosocial adjustment is related to both cultural identity (Guzman et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2003) and positive self-esteem (DeNeve & Cooper, 1998; Donnellan et al., 2007; DuBois & Flay, 2004; Haney & Durlak, 1998; Koch, 2006; Montgomery, Miville, Winterowd, Jeffries, & Baysden, 2000; Powers, 2006; Rosenberg, Schooler, & Schoenbach, 1989; Swann et al., 2007; Whitbeck et al., 2001) .

Out of respect for the confidentiality of the tribal communities involved, we refer to these communities only by broad cultural group descriptors -Northern Plains, Southwest, and Pueblo -rather than by specific tribal affiliation. Sampling for Voices began with Fall 1993 school rosters of participating high schools (two in the Northern Plains, one each in Southwest and Pueblo). Data were collected semi-annually for three years from this sample and, on a rolling enrollment basis, from additional students attending the schools at any subsequent data collection session. For the original cohort established in Fall 1993, community-based follow-up consisted of re-contacting those participants who could no longer be found in the schools; this sampling procedure captured a majority of adolescents within the target age range (14 to 18) in each community, both those in and out of school. A total of six waves (Ws) of data were collected (W1 to W6). In all, 82% of those on the roster participated in the initial Voices data collection (W1); this participation rate did not differ by community. The population of inference was those on the school rosters as of \"count week\"the date in early October 1993 that schools reported enrollment figures to funding agencies for federal educational monies; during the 4 to 6 weeks between this reporting period and the data collection period, the schools dropped students from their rosters due to chronic absenteeism or transfer; as a result, the participation rate noted here is a conservative one.",

First, we included only participants who self-identified as American Indian, excluding 165 participants (5.5% of the sample) who were non-Indian students in these reservation schools (American Indian sample N=2,841). Second, because our outcome variable was academic performance in high school, we included only participants in the cohort who were expected to still be in school at the end of the study; this excluded students were in grade 11 or 12 at the beginning of the study (W1) and thus unlikely to still be in school 2\u00bd years later at W8 (cohort sample N=1,977, 69.6% of the American Indian sample). From this cohort, an additional 366 participants were excluded because they had graduated by W8 (11 students, .6% of the cohort sample), had dropped out of school (47 students, 2.4%), or because they were missing data for both W7 and W8 (308 students, 15.6%; we do not know whether these students had graduated, dropped out, or transferred to other schools). The final analytic sample for this study thus consisted of 1,611 students, including 810 males and 801 females (50% each); the average age at W1 was 14.0 years; 837 (52%) were from the Southwest, 247 (15%) from Pueblos, and 527 (33%) from the Northern Plains.",

FIML estimates model parameters from all of the available information relevant to each parameter; this significantly reduced the biases associated with missing data patterns and allowed us to be confident that estimates were fairly accurate despite incomplete data across waves. Nonetheless, before estimating our model, we conducted analyses to determine whether patterns of missing data were related to the model constructs. On average, students participated in 3.7 waves of data collection. This overall participation rate reflected missing waves due to rolling enrollment in the study as well as to attrition; because students were enrolled not only at W1 but also at each subsequent wave of data collection, not all students were eligible to participate at all six waves. Once enrolled in the study, students participated in an average of 88% of subsequent waves of data collection (e.g., students enrolled at W1 averaged 5.4 of 6 possible Ws (90% participation); students enrolled at W3 averaged 3.5 of 4 Ws subsequent to W3 (88% participation). We compared students who completed four or more surveys (n=850) to those who completed three or fewer (n=761) on average levels of self-esteem, American Indian identity, personal resources, problem behaviors, and academic success, and gender and tribal group distributions. Only three small significant differences were found -for problem behaviors, academic performance, and tribe. Compared to those with more complete data, adolescents with fewer waves of data had greater problem behaviors (F (1,1533)=45.15, p<.001, eta 2 =.029) and poorer academic performance (F(1,1597)=6.68, p=. 01, eta 2 =.004). Southwest adolescents were more likely to have four or more waves (56.7%) of data than were Pueblo (49.8%) or Northern Plains adolescents (47.8%) (\u03c7 2 (2)=11.38, p=. 003). Because these effects were small, we did not feel that they posed serious problems in our analyses, particularly given our use of FIML estimation; nonetheless, we remained cognizant of these differences in our interpretation of findings.",

As Table 2 indicates, the intercepts of these trajectories were relatively high, above the scale mean for both selfesteem (unstandardized intercept = 3.90, scale range = 1 to 5) and American Indian identity (intercept=2.74, scale range = 1 to 4). Also for both trajectories, when modeled independently, the slopes were positive and significant at p<.001; standardized estimates indicated modest gains in both self-esteem (\u03b2 = .23) and American Indian identity (\u03b2 = .29), for the sample as whole, across the high school years. However, when the trajectories were estimated within the full model, thus controlling for other factors (as shown in Table 2 ), the slopes for each became nonsignificant, although significant variability remained (p<.001) around both the intercepts and the slopes, reflecting considerable individual differences among adolescents.",

Figure 2 provides an overview of all significant relationships that emerged in the full model (Model 1). As inspection of this figure makes clear, patterns of growth in self-esteem were related to W5 levels of resources and problems, even after controlling for the significant relationships between these factors at W1. A strong relationship between growth in self-esteem and W6 academic success was accounted for by the mediating effects of W5 resources and problems.

                "text": "Our findings provide important insights into factors related to academic success among American Indian adolescents. Most notably, self-esteem was strongly related to academic success, and our analyses suggested that this relationship was more related to the effects of self-esteem on achievement than to the effects of achievement on self-esteem: W1 academic success was not related to subsequent trajectories of self-esteem, while trajectories of selfesteem were related to W6 reports of academic success. Our final model was fairly successful in explaining academic success: 56% of the variance in this outcome variable was accounted for and, after controlling for W1 academic success, most of the remaining variance accounted for was due to the predictive effects of self-esteem trajectories. Of central importance was the finding that much of the relationship between self-esteem and academic success could be explained by the intermediary effects of personal resources and problem behaviors, as we had expected it would be. The indirect effects of the slope of self-esteem, through personal resources and problem behaviors, was significant (\u03b2 = .16, p<.001), even after controlling for W1 relationships. Thus, it appears that gains in self-esteem may play both promotive and protective roles, supporting the development of personal resources that facilitate academic success and enhancing resilience to problem behaviors that interfere with such success. Controlling for the effects of initial levels of academic success, resources, and problems, helped to rule out the alternative explanation that the \"impact\" of self-esteem simply reflected the increased likelihood that high self-esteem would develop in the context of personal resources and in the absence of problem behaviors -that it was only a marker of these kinds of processes rather than a causal factor in them. We did find evidence that earlier resources and problems affected trajectories of self-esteem (earlier academic success did not), but we also found clear evidence that self-esteem affected those factors in turn. Our findings offered evidence of a complex interplay among the factors in our model, suggesting that self-esteem was not merely tangential to these processes but rather that it played a significant role.",

While this finding was consistent with other reports (Chavous et al., 2003; Fuligni et al., 2005; Guzman et al., 2005) , it did not support speculation that engagement with cultural traditions would foster success. One explanation for the discrepant effects observed for self-esteem and American Indian identity may lie in their different relationships to individualistic goals. Academic success is closely aligned with such goals; achievement is de facto aligned with individual performance. Thus, it was not really surprising that self-esteem -a marker of personal self -was strongly related to academic success while American Indian identity -a marker of collective identity -was not. Were we to include an outcome indicator more attuned to collective goals, particularly goals consonant with American Indian culture, we might find American Indian identity to be strongly related and self-esteem superfluous. For example, cultural identity might be more predictive than self-esteem of students' engagement in community service activities. It is likely that defining optimal outcomes on the basis of cultural goals will be important in determining the impact of cultural identification in adolescent development, while defining outcomes in terms of mainstream American goals -like academic success -stacks the deck toward finding that personal self is more important than collective self.",

While our inclusion of measures of both attitude toward school and educational goals, along with self-reported grades and relative performance, broadened this construct beyond simple performance, it still failed to capture important indicators of school experiences such as interaction with teachers, preference for challenging coursework, and school dropout or truancy (Ashmore et al., 2004) . In addition, achievement was defined in terms of mainstream U.S. cultural values, including high grades, outperforming peers, liking school, and planning for higher education. For adolescents growing up in American Indian communities, cultural conflicts can arise around each of these indicators: 1) The ultimate value placed on grades may have been downplayed by adolescents closely connected to their tribal cultures, with greater emphasis on balance between academic pursuits and other goals; 2) outperforming peers may have been seen as less optimal for these youth than was working together with peers for communal success; 3) a distrust of mainstream educational systems, tied to negative histories of boarding school policies and forced acculturation practices in government-run school systems, may have led culturally identified students to report less positive attitudes toward school; and 4) a perceived lack of relevance of the agendas of American education for the lives of adolescents in reservation communities may have led some students to place less value on higher education. Thus, while students with positive cultural identities may have been better equipped to succeed in school, they may also have been less inclined to work toward mainstream achievement goals.",

Indeed, we are finding links between cultural identity and achievement in the new study in which we included school-reported grades and test scores (Whitesell et al., 2007) .

While it provided information on the extent to which students defined themselves in terms of their tribal cultures and the extent to which they participated in cultural traditions and activities, it was unable to capture the complexity of cultural identity, particularly the variation in that identity across tribal contexts. In recent work, we have begun to explore the utility of a much more fine-grained assessment of the meaning of tribal culture for students -including careful measures of both their knowledge of their culture and their attitudes about the importance of that culture in their everyday lives. Using such a measure in one of the Southwest communities that participated in the study reported on here, we have found strong links between cultural attitudes and academic performance (both self-reported and school-reported grades and test scores) and modest links between cultural knowledge and achievement (Whitesell et al., 2007) .

Several significant differences across cultural context -Northern Plains, Pueblo, or Southwest -are worth noting again here. Culture groups differed in rates of change in self-esteem across the high school years, and rates of change in self-esteem were predictive of W6 academic achievement; thus we observed small indirect effects of culture group on academic success. A significant direct path also existed from Southwest tribe membership to academic success; this path was especially evident when personal resources and problem behaviors were included as mediators, suggesting that academic success among Southwest adolescents was somewhat lower than might be expected given their significantly lower levels of problems. One possible explanation for this somewhat puzzling finding may lie in the fact that the tribal cultures in the Southwest tend to value modesty and downplay focus on individual accomplishments. Self-report measures of grade-point average and performance relative to peers may, thus, have underestimated the actual level of achievement among adolescents in this community, although this explanation would suggest a similar pattern should have emerged in the Pueblo group, which also instantiates these values, but that we did not observe. It is also possible that other factors not accounted for in our model were particularly relevant to predicting academic success in this tribal community. For example, we know that youth in the Southwest, at least at the time of this study, remained more oriented toward success in the traditional economy and/or the trades than those in the other communities; this orientation may have lessened the importance of academic success for individual youth in the Southwest tribes and decreased its significance as an outcome for this cohort. Future work including objective measures of achievement will be necessary to explore this possibility.",

When cultural values favor collective goals, as is often the case in American Indian communities, strong cultural identity might not be expected to relate to individual academic success. Our findings seem to suggest that efforts to increase achievement will be more successful if they focus on self-esteem, personal resources, and the reduction of problem behaviors rather than on fostering strong cultural identity. However, we suggest that rather than definitely answering questions about the nature of the link between culture and academic success, our findings point to the need to refine the questions. More comprehensive operationalizations of culture and the meaning of culture in adolescents' lives are necessary before we can truly understand its relationship to student achievement. Conceptual model of self-esteem (SE), American Indian identity (AIID), personal resources, problem behaviors, and academic success. Final model of relationships of self-esteem (SE) and American Indian identity (AIID) trajectories with personal resources, problem behaviors, and academic achievement.
