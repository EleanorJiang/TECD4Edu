It is often argued that the negative development of IM in elementary school strongly depends on the presence of school grades (e.g., Deutsch, 1979) as grades represent extrinsic consequences (see self-determination theory; Ryan & Deci, 2000) and previous achievement outcomes (see expectancy-value model; that should influence intrinsically motivated behaviour. Indeed, a large body of research has steadily documented relations between IM and grades (e.g., Corpus, McClintic-Gilbert, & Hayenga, 2009; Gottfried, 1990) . To clarify the role of grades for change in students' IM, however, longitudinal studies are needed. Moreover, it is crucial to assess the constructs several times a year (see Viljaranta, Tolvanen, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2014) . First, children receive grades not only at the end but also throughout the school year, and the relation between grades and IM could vary within a school year. Second, because of changes in the school environment throughout a student's school career, it is likely that the importance of gradesand thus their relation to IMvaries across school years. More precisely, grades should be of great relevance right after their implementation (usually at the end of Grade 2 in German schools). Furthermore, in tracked academic school systems, grades are especially important at the end of elementary school when students receive recommendations for a specific secondary school type on the basis of their prior performance in school. Investigating children in the period when grades are highly salient is thus a promising approach for broadening knowledge about the developmental dynamics of grades and IM.",

It remains an open question whether they found only weak relations because they did not consider grades immediately after their implementation.

Accordingly, an activity has high intrinsic value and, thus, is understood as intrinsically motivated when it is performed for no sake but its own reward, and the activity is accompanied by positive emotions and is perceived as highly satisfying (Wigfield & Eccles, 1992 ). Even though intrinsic task values are not the only reason for learning, affective liking and enjoyment can be considered to be the most desirable states for learners because learning happens as a side effect of engaging in a pleasurable activity (see White, 1959) . Research has found that children's intrinsic task values are domainspecific even in the first grade (e.g., Eccles, Wigfield, Harold, & Blumenfeld, 1993) . In particular, for elementary school-aged children, intrinsic task values play an outstanding role as these children do not yet distinguish other task values such as utility or importance (e.g., Eccles et al., 1993; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992) .",

School grades, 'the basic currency of our educational system' (Deutsch, 1979, p. 393) , might play a decisive role in this development.

This subtheory within self-determination theory posits that IM in achievement settings depends on the fulfilment of two primary needs: the need for competence and the need for autonomy. According to CET, external incentives (e.g., tangible rewards, pressured evaluations, directives) undermine IM because individuals perceive their behaviour as externally regulated instead of self-determined (undermining effect; Deci & Ryan, 1985) . However, experimental studies have shown that this undermining effect does not occur when the external incentive comprises positive competence feedback (for an overview, see Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 1999) . It was argued that if the informative aspect of the positive feedback outweighed the controlling aspect of the external incentive, IM should not diminish because the positive competence feedback should satisfy the person's need for competence (see Deci & Ryan, 1985) . Applying these considerations to the educational context, school grades can be seen as an external incentive (Deutsch, 1979) that comprises competence-related information. Students with good grades receive positive performance feedback, which should satisfy their need for competence so that they should not lose their IM. By contrast, students with poor grades receive negative performance feedback, which should undermine feelings of competence and therefore lead to a decrease in IM. Vice versa, it is also plausible that IM influences later achievement, for example, mediated via task choice .",

Moreover, the effect of students' first report card grades in secondary school on changes in students' school engagement was mediated via their affective reactions to their grades (Poorthuis et al., 2015) . Although effects on IM were not tested, negative affect elicited by poor grades should be incompatible with IM as IM is characterized by positive feelings during task processing (White, 1959) . We are aware of only two studies that longitudinally investigated the reciprocal relation between school grades and IM in elementary school while controlling for prior grades and motivation. Using a series of hierarchical regressions, Corpus et al. (2009) found small reciprocal effects between grades and school-related IM over 1 school year in six cohorts (third to eighth grade), whereby analyses were not performed separately for each cohort. Thus, no specific conclusions can be drawn for elementary school children. Weidinger et al. (2015) found only minor effects of students' grades in German on changes in domain-specific IM, whereby both constructs were assessed six times at an interval of 4 months between Grades 3 and 4. The effects might have been somewhat stronger if the constructs had been assessed at the end of Grade 2 when the children received grades for the first time in their school career. If there is an effect of grades on IM, the chances of finding such an effect in this period of education are very high due to the pronounced importance of grades. Moreover, it is necessary to cross-validate findings in another domain. These limitations should be addressed in this study.",

Only students whose parents provided informed consent participated in the study (75% of the target sample). The study began in July 2009 and comprised seven measurement occasions at an interval of 4 months each (see Table 1 ). The first measurement occasion (t 1 ) took place at the end of Grade 2 when children were on average 7.95 years old (SD = 0.58). At the last measurement occasion (t 7 ), the children were approximately 2 years older (M = 9.93, SD = 0.72). Weidinger et al.

First, two linear LGCMs (for IM and grades) were estimated. IM was considered as first-order factor from t 1 to t 7 indicated by three items each time (see CFA model). The latent intercept and slope were modelled as second-order factors. To model a change, the loadings of the first-order factors on the intercept were set to 1. The slope factor loadings from t 1 to t 7 (c t1 -c t7 ) were fixed to [0 1 2 3 4 5 6] to estimate a linear development. Thus, the mean of the slope factor and its algebraic sign indicate the overall magnitude of the change and its direction, whereas the slope variance indicates interindividual differences in change (Hypothesis 1).

Maybe performance feedback in the form of grades becomes more important for students' motivation after elementary school because self-worth and self-perceptions are shaped more by normative factors (social comparisons) in adolescence than in childhood (see Harter, 1998; Jacobs, Bleeker, & Constantino, 2003) and because of the changes in the school environment that occur in secondary school (see Wigfield & Eccles, 1994) . For example, public evaluations of achievement increase in secondary school (Harter, Whitesell, & Kowalski, 1992) , which facilitates social achievement comparisons and competition between students (see Wigfield & Eccles, 1994) , which in turn should increase the salience of grades and their effects on motivation. In line with this, Poorthuis et al. (2015) found that students who expected their classmates to perform very well (high-performance norms) experienced relatively high levels of negative affect when receiving poor grades. Thus, students' reactions to grades seem to depend at least in part on the perceived importance of their own performance as the perceived importance of performance should be positively associated with higher performance pressure and increased social comparisons. This is in line with the two small effects found in our study. Grades slightly impacted change in IM in math after grades were introduced at the end of Grade 2 and after the recommendations for the school transition in Grade 4 were made. When grades become extremely salient, they seem to have at least a small impact on students' math-related IM even in elementary school. This differentiated picture of the relation between the constructs would not have come to light whether the constructs had been assessed only once a year. Thus, we recommend that researchers investigate change in IM several times during the school year to better understand what impacts this change.",

Therefore, the decline in IM might be attributed to other possibly causative factors.

Further potential moderators are factors that proved to be important for IM development such as students' achievement goals (Haimovitz, Wormington, & Corpus, 2011) , the teacher-student relationship (Opdenakker, Maulana, & den Brok, 2012) , classroom values, teacher enthusiasm (Frenzel, Goetz, Pekrun, & Watt, 2010) , and verbal feedback during class (Jurik, Gr\u20ac oschner, & Seidel, 2014; Rakoczy, Klieme, B\u20ac urgermeister, & Harks, 2008) .",

However, our findings must be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, we investigated only students from Germany. In most German federal states, the transition to secondary school takes place after Grade 4. Thus, it is important to evaluate the generalizability of the findings in other countries where children leave elementary school later. Second, we analysed data from the same project as Weidinger et al. (2015) . Results should be replicated with other teachers and students. Third, we investigated only one aspect of adaptive motivational orientation in school, namely the enjoyment and pleasure one gains from doing math. Thus, our results are limited to this specific aspect of motivation. Finally, we investigated only grades as one source of achievement-related feedback. However, students are exposed to different kinds of performance feedback in everyday school life. Besides verbal feedback from teachers and peers during class, students receive implicit information on how good their school performance is (e.g., who is offered help or who is asked to answer a difficult question; see Stipek & Mac Iver, 1989) . In line with these ideas, even young children seem to be quite good at evaluating their actual performance without receiving explicit feedback (see Viljaranta, Lerkkanen, Poikkeus, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2009) . In this context, it would be interesting to see how teachers' judgements of students' ability impact a student's motivational development (see Urhahne, 2015) . This is particularly important with regard to intervention programs as teachers could be taught how several behaviours and responses might affect their students' IM.",

The finding that grades are only weakly related to the negative development of students' IM is counterintuitive and contradicts the widespread notion that grades, especially poor grades, are detrimental to the pleasure one gains from doing school-related task. It is important to know this because teachers might feel as if they are doing harm when grading their students. The results indicate that students' IM for school-based learning does not necessarily suffer in the face of suboptimal grades.",
