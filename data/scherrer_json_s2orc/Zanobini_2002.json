Also in educational psychology different concepts related to the Self have been the focus of much research and many theories (see the classic studies by Rotter, r\u00f9Teiner and Bandura). In their studies of school contexts, some authors have analyzed how s\u00f9dentS beliefs about their abilities and comperence change during their school years (Harter, 1981; Eccles et al., 1984i Harter et al., L992) .",

An analysis comparing three selfconcept and two self-esteem scales showed that they measure a virtually identical constmct (Crain & Bracken, 1994) .

Marsh and collegues (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985; Marsh, 1989) claimed that self-concept cannot be adequately understood if multidimensionality is ignored (see also Delugach et al., 1992) . Many authors have made a distinction between global self-concept and specific self-concepts. The latter reflect people's evaluation of how well they perform in certain aspects of their lives. Most likely these evaluations vary significantly across contextual domains, as reflected by the well-known construct of 'working self-concept' (Marcus & Kunda, 198\u00f3) . Rosenberg et al. (1995) claimed that global and specific self-esteem are different in both nature and consequence. They are interrelated but not interchangeable. Global self-esteem is defined as the attitude toward an object (the Self) as a totality. On the other hand, specific self-esteem is an attitude toward a specific facet of Self. Global self-esteem is mostly affective in nanrre and tends \u00eeo be associated with overall psychological well-being. Specific self-esteem (i.e. academic self-esteem) appears more cognitive in nature and tends to be more relevant to behavioural outcomes (in this specific case, school performance). Furthermore, specific self-concept is more context dependent than global self-concept and is therefore less stable (Crain & Bracken, 1994; Harter, 1999) . For these reasons) different specific aspects of sel\u00c8concept, rather than the global construct, are considered. Bracken et al. in their hierarchical model evaluate six domain-specific sel\u00c8concepts: academic, social, physical, competence, affect and family self-concepts (Bracken, 1992; Ctatn & Bracken, 1994) . Academic self-concept concems the pupil's academic performance; social self-concept refers to interpersonal relationships; physical self-concept concerns both physical appearance and physical ability; competence self-concept is related to successful behaviours within the environment; finally, affect and family self-concepts refer respectively to emotional reactions and to the family situation.",

Motivation also may be considered and evaluated as a non-unitary construct. It differs in terms of the intemaVexternal dimension (Vallerand et al. 1992) . Motivation is internal or intrinsic when students are intrinsically motivated to learn and engage in educational activities ('I go to school because I like learning new things'). Conversely, motivation is external or extrinsic when the learning process is just a way of obtaining other benefits, such as social success or other kinds of rewards ('I go to school to get good marks or to get a bener job in the future').",

The first takes into account the higher level of leaming required by the teachers (Simmons & Blyth, 1987; Seidman et al., 1994) . The second is that middle school students are more performance oriented than fifth grade pupils (Anderman & Midgley, 1997) . When students are performance orientated, they work harder in order to demonstrare their skills. However, task-orientated students (such as elementary school students) work in order to improoe t}ret competencies. This is connected to a more positive attitude towards learning and to the use of effective learning s\u00faategies.

Young children seem to over-estimate their competence, while early adolescents appear to be more realistic. On the other hand, factors associated with the new school environment may influence students' beliefs about their own competencies. Our hypothesis is that there are some other aspects of domain-specific sel\u00c8concept besides the academic self-concept which are sensitive to the changes brought about by transitions. In particular, the competence sellconcept which relates to behaviours oriented to environmental control is probably the most affected by a change of school (and environment). Furthermore, as competence self-concept concerns the behaviour in a number of situations and at different times (and can thus be considered the most pervasive domain-specific self-concept) it will probably influence the other domain-specific sel\u00c8concepts.",

In lower middle school there is greater emphasis on discipline and teacher contol, together with a less personal teacher/pupil relationship. In addition, students have fewer oppornrnities to make decisions, choose activities and manage their own learning process (Anderman & Maehr, 1994) . Corbi\u00e8re (L997) considered the consequent lack of motivation (amotivation) as the best predictor of academic failure. In addition to a general decline in motivation, a shift from a predominantly intrinsic to a more extrinsic motivational orientation was ascertained over a period of \u00f3 years, from third grade to ninth grade, particularly between sixth grade and seventh grade (Harter, 1981) . This can be explained by the self-determination theory. This theory (Ryan & Grolnick, 1986; Deci et al., l99L) mantains that social-contextual factors influence intrinsic motivation and, consequently, academic performance. Central to this theory is the idea that only social contexts that support people's autonomy are able to promote inuinsic motivation. Thus, a more control-orientated educational environment has a significant negative effect on s\u00eeudents' motivation and self-determination. To sum up, a number of studies revealed ttrat following the transition from primary to low middle school, pupils immediately become more negative about school and about themselves, more anxious about their performance and less inuinsically motivated.",

Some aurhors have found a link between type of motivation (sel\u00c8determined or other-determined) and pupils' perception of teachers' autonomy supportiveness or control. Pupils' perceptions of teachers' autonomy supportiveness were positively associated with intrinsic motivation, although their perceptions of teacher control were positively associated with lack of motivation (Deci er al.' l99l). Roeser & Eccles (1998) found that the more teachers thought given individuals were good pupils, the more those pupils valued school over the course of time. In other words, the academic self-concept, which is also based on the opinion that other people have about academic performance, affects school motivation.",

As various authors (Seidman et al., 1994; Vigfield et al., 1996) have pointed out, over the last decade the deztelopmental stage-enoironmental fit model has prevailed. This model tries to explain negative changes in different domains of the self-system in the light of interaction between individual and contextual components: the mismatch between the developmental needs of early adolescents and the demands of the new social environment (characterised as large, anonymous and with a greater control function over student behaviour) seems to be responsible for the decline in the self-system.",

As expected, academic self-concept influences school results at the first and second age level, and intrinsic motivation in the last year of primary school, which partly confirms findings in the literature (Harter et al., 7992t Losier & Vallerand, 1994) ; 2. However, the picture changes at the second school level, where another aspect of sel\u00c8concept has a substantial effect on motivational orientation: the competence at controlling the environment. After the transition and probably as a consequence of environmental changes and the attendant breakdown of the social network, the component of the self-system, which Bouffard (1998) defines as perceived conuol over success and failure and which concerns the efficient functioning of the individual in various spheres (Bracken, 1992) begins to predominate; 3. Finally, intrinsic motivational orientation has no direct influence on school results at the age levels under consideration, while lack of motivation has a negative impact on these results, but only at the first level. It is possible that the differential effect of intrinsic motivational orientation on success at school suggested by other authors (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Corbi\u00e8re, 1997) is not yet evident at the age levels under consideration. The importance of these considerations is all the greater in view of the imminent restnrcfi.rring of school levels to be introduced as pan of a planned general reform of Italy's school system. lVhile it is important that schools should make pupils aware of their limits, it is also vital that they also help them to consolidate their self-esteem. This would avoid the danger faced by students at all age levels of falling into the twin uap of low academic achievement and lack of motivation.",
