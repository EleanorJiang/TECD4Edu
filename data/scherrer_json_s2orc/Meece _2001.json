    "abstract": "The authors examined the temporal stability of elementary school students' (N \u03ed 432) motivation goals (task-mastery, performance, and work-avoidant) for literacy activities in the classroom. Task-specific assessments of students' goals were collected in the fall and spring of Grades 3, 4, and 5. Stability coefficients indicated a reasonable degree of consistency in students' goal responses over time, even though goals were initially assessed in relation to a specific learning assignment. However, there were also significant mean-level changes in students' goals within the school year and significant linear declines in task-mastery and performance goals over time. Changes were consistent across gender groups and across ability levels. Additionally, changes in task-mastery goal ratings explained variations in students' reported use of active learning strategies in reading and writing activities. The important implications of this study for future research are discussed.",

The present study examined three types of goal orientations identified in previous research with elementary, secondary, and college students (Duda & Nicholls, 1992; Harackiewicz, Barron, Tauer, Carter, & Elliot, 2000; Nicholls, 1989; Nicholls, Patashnick, & Nolen, 1985; Nolen, 1988; Nolen & Haldyna 1990a , 1990b Thorkildsen & Nicholls, 1998) . Two of the goals represent different forms of approach motivation. For the purposes of this study, task-mastery goals are defined as a desire to improve one's ability, to master a skill, and to understand learning material; whereas performance goals represent a desire to demonstrate high ability relative to others and to attain favorable judgements of one's abilities. These two goal constructs are conceptually similar to those referred to as task versus ego (Nicholls, 1984 (Nicholls, , 1989 , learning versus performance (Dweck & Elliot, 1983) , and mastery versus ability (Ames & Archer, 1988) . Recently, researchers have called for a more refined definition of performance goals that distinguishes between demonstrating high ability and avoiding negative evaluations of ability (Elliot & Church, 1997; Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996; Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Skaalvik, 1997) . The present study used a measure of performance goals that focused on students' desire to attain positive evaluations of their ability (e.g., ''I wanted to do better on this assignment than other students'' and ''I wanted the teacher to think I was smart''), and it was assumed to assess approach motivation.",

The work-avoidant goal measure used in the present study was developed on the basis of research by Nicholls and his colleagues (Duda & Nicholls, 1992; Meece et al., 1988; Nicholls, 1984; Nicholls et al., 1985; Nolen, 1988; Nolen & Haladyna, 1990a , 1990b Thorkildsen & Nicholls, 1998) , and it represented a desire to reduce effort or to avoid work.",

Some studies focus on students' personal goals in school (Midgley et al., 1995; Nicholls et al., 1985; Roeser et al., 1996; Ryan, Hicks, & Midgley, 1997; Skaalvik, 1997) , whereas other research focuses on students' goals in a particular classroom (Ames & Archer, 1988; Thorklidsen & Nicholls, 1998; Urdan et al., 1998) or in a subject area (Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Elliot & Church, 1997; Harackiewicz et al., 1998 Harackiewicz et al., , 2000 Meece et al., 1988; Nicholls et al., 1989; Nolen, 1988; Schunk, 1996; Stipek & Gralinski, 1997; Wigfield & Guthrie, 1997; Wolters et al., 1996) . Similarly, some researchers have argued that students' achievement goals are situation-specific because they are influenced by characteristics of the learning situation (Ames, 1992a; Ames & Archer, 1988; Elliot & Dweck, 1988; Jagacinski & Nicholls, 1984; Meece, 1991) . However, other researchers report consistency in students' motivation goals across achievement domains (Duda & Nicholls, 1992; Stipek & Gralinski, 1996) and across school settings (Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Roeser et al., 1996) . Thus, additional research is needed to examine the specificity and generality of students' achievement goals.",

To become competent readers and writers, students must be willing to expend cognitive effort, to regulate attention and learning processes, and to persist when they experience difficulty. Thus, motivation factors play a critical role in the development of literacy skills in middle childhood and beyond (Guthrie, Wigfield, Metsala, & Cox, 1999; Wigfield & Guthrie, 1997) .

It is important to note that students' goal responses were assessed in terms of a specific learning assignment. It was assumed that this item format would be appropriate for elementary school children. It was also assumed that this form of assessment would increase the variability of student's responses and thus decrease stability estimates. As described below, we assessed children's goals for reading and writing across a range of literacy activities. Because goals were assessed at the task-specific level, we tested for task differences in goal ratings before averaging scores across activities for longitudinal analyses. Earlier research Meece et al., 1988; Miller & Meece, 1997) has documented few consistent task-related differences in students' goal orientations.",

On the basis of prior research, we expected to find little change in students' goal responses within the school year, but significant changes across grade levels. This hypothesis is consistent with findings reported by Anderman and Midgley (1997) , who reported that fifth-and sixth-grade students show greater stability in goal ratings within than across school years. We also expected to find negative changes in students' taskmastery goals across time. This prediction is consistent with research that has documented negative declines in motivation measures assessing the intrinsic value of reading (Eccles et al., 1993; Langer et al., 1990; McKenna et al., 1990) . In addition, we expected to find increases in performance-oriented goals over the late elementary school years. This hypothesis is consistent with research suggesting that students tend to use more social comparison information to judge their abilities in late childhood (Eccles & Midgley, 1989) and to report stronger performance goals by early adolescence (Anderman Midgley, Anderman, & Hicks, 1995) .

There were no differences between the two cohorts in gender composition. The total sample included 211 girls and 240 boys. A majority of the children (85%) were from White, middle-or uppermiddle-class families. However, the ability level of the sample was diverse. Students' standardized reading scores on the California Achievement Test (CAT) in third grade ranged from the 1st to 99th percentile, with half of the students achieving a national standard score at or above the 68th percentile. Cohort 1 students had slightly higher achievement scores than did Cohort 2 students (M \u03ed 64.6 and 62.4, respectively). Sample attrition rates were 35% for Cohort 1 over a 3-year period and 27% for Cohort 2 over a 2-year period.",

The teachers differed in their approach to teaching language arts: Grades 4 and 5 teachers used a standard text for language arts, whereas Grade 3 teachers integrated their language arts instruction within reading activities. Informal interviews with teachers indicated that testing pressures were greater in the upper grades. End-of-year standardized tests were given at the end of every grade, beginning with the third grade. Students also completed a state-mandated writing test in the fourth grade.

Simple assignments involved worksheets or exercise that required a simple response, such as circling the correct answer, filling in the blank, or writing single words or phrases. Complex assignments involved writing multiple paragraphs (e.g., essays or research reports). Additionally, simple assignments were generally completed independently within one lesson, whereas complex assignments involved peer collaboration and extended beyond one lesson.

The student questionnaires were group-administered by the second author and a doctoral student in October and May of each school year. The questionnaire items were read aloud to the students in their classrooms, and two people were available to provide assistance when needed. Prior to administering the questionnaire, students were given sample items to practice using a Likert scale. For example, they were asked to rate how much they liked a particular flavor of ice cream and to discuss their responses.

We calcu-lated consistency coefficients for the two cohorts separately due to differences in the number of goal assessments across time. Coefficients for Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, were .78 and .79 for Task-Mastery Goals, .86 and .88 for Performance Goals, and .79 and .81 for Work-Avoidant Goals. Coefficients of this magnitude indicate a reasonable degree of stability in assessments across time (see Mischel & Peake, 1982) . Table 5 shows means and standard deviations on the goal measures used in the longitudinal analyses by cohort group. As described earlier, attrition rates were 35% for Cohort 1 over a 3-year period and 27% for Cohort 2 over a 2-year period. Prior to the longitudinal analyses, we compared Grade 3 measures of students with complete versus missing data across the 2-or 3-year period to establish the comparability of the samples. For Cohort 1, with an attrition rate of 35%, there were no significant differences in Grade 3 standardized achievement scores or goal ratings between students with complete or with missing data across the 3-year period. For Cohort 2, only one significant difference was found (t \u03ed \u03ea2.91, df \u03ed 290, p \u03fd .01) over the 2-year period: Students with complete data had higher achievement test scores (M \u03ed 108, SD \u03ed 13.62) than did students with incomplete data (M \u03ed 102, SD \u03ed 15.37).",

Analyses were performed by cohort for two reasons. First, the Note. All scores are based on a 4-point scale. cohorts differed in terms of the number of goal assessments, and complete data is required for a repeated-measures MANOVA. Second, separate analyses provide an opportunity to replicate trends in the data across more than one sample. This first set of analyses focused on overall patterns of change. Individual differences in change patterns related to ability level and gender are described in later sections. Thus, all MANOVAs reported here have one withinsubject factor: time of measurement. There were six assessments per goal in Cohort 1 (Grades 3 to 5) and four assessments per goal in Cohort 2 (Grades 3 and 4). Post hoc tests for repeated measures were used to compare specific means when multivariate tests for time of measurement were significant. Due to the possible number of contrasts, Bonferroni tests were used to adjust for inflated Type I error. Table 6 presents results from the MANOVA analyses that examined timeof-measurement effects. As shown here, results revealed significant time-ofmeasurement effects for all three goal measures and for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. However, as shown in Fig. 1 , trends in the data were not consistent across goal measures and cohorts. Post hoc tests for repeated measures were performed to identify the direction of change and the significant points of change in the data, after adjusting for multiple contrasts.",

Consistent with this hypothesis, there were significant decreases in students' task-mastery ratings by the end of the fourth grade in both cohorts. For Cohort 1, the decline was quite large in magnitude (effect size \u03ed .71), but this decline did not continue into Grade 5 for Cohort 1.

We did not find significant grade-related increases in students' desire to compete with others for high grades or for social approval (i.e., performance goals). For our sample of students, performance goals declined over time. The fact that the strength task-mastery and performance goals were both decreasing, at least through fourth grade, provides further evidence that these motivational constructs are not inversely related nor opposite ends of a bipolar continuum (Meece & Holt, 1993; Thorklidsen & Nicholls, 1998) .

Although studies have examined within-year correlations between students' goal ratings (Meece et al., 1988; Stipek & Gralinski, 1996; Wolters et al., 1996) , we know of no other study that has examined mean changes in students' motivational goals within the same school year. However, studies report similar findings for other motivational constructs. For example, Eccles and her colleagues (1989) reported significant withinyear declines in the importance seventh-grade students attach to doing well in mathematics, but the perceived importance of doing well in English increased over the school year. Similarly, Wigfield et al. (1991) reported significant within-year declines of sixth-and seventh-grade students' liking of mathematics, but their liking of English showed significant within-year increases. Also, Ames (1992) found significant within-year declines in students' intrinsic motivation and perceived competence. Taken together, these findings stress the importance of obtaining multiple assessments of motivational variables during the school year. Results based on single assessments may be misleading in terms of when changes in motivation occur.",

However, these findings are contrary to the suggestion that performance goals are positively related to academic performance, a finding that has been reported for college-age students (Harackiewicz et al., 1998 (Harackiewicz et al., , 2000 .",

The findings indicated that changes in task-mastery goals were predictive of changes in students' self-reports of strategy use. As Table 8 indicates, grade level changes were more pronounced for self-reports of active learning strategies. Thus changes in students' task-mastery goals have implications for the degree to which students use learning strategies that are going to improve their reading and writing competencies. Other studies have reported a ''fourth grade'' slump in students' achievement in reading (Chall, Jacobs, & Baldwin, 1990) . Most longitudinal studies of literacy development, however, have not included motivational measures to help explain these developmental trends. The present study emphasizes the need for additional longitudinal studies that examine relations between motivation and cognitive processes in the development of literacy skills (Wigfield, 1997) .",

Results indicate that goals assessed at the task level may be less reliable than measures at the domain level (i.e., goals for reading, mathematics, or sports). Low scale reliabilities may explain why it is difficult to detect task differences in goal responses. Second, as discussed, the data emphasize the need to collect multiple assessments of students' motivation responses in order to detect when changes occur. The current study revealed few changes in students' achievement goals between grade levels. Instead, most changes occurred during the school year. Such findings provide strong evidence that age-related changes in motivation are the result of schooling experiences.",

Despite the specificity of the measure used, a majority of the stability coefficients computed were within the same range as other researchers have reported for goals measured at a more general level (see, for example, Anderman & Duda & Nicholls, 1992; Wolters et al., 1996; Stipek & Gralinski, 1996) . These data suggest that students' goal responses are not simply responses to a specific learning situation. However, our data also point out that a particular goal rating was less predictive of future ratings on that scale as the time interval between assessments increased. Additionally, the longitudinal analyses indicated that there were significant fluctuations in the strength of students' goals for literacy activities over time. The important contribution of this study was to show that most changes in students' goals occurred within the school year rather than at the transition to a new grade level or to a new learning environment.",
