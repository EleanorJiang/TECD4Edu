Descriptive findings provide a longitudinal profile of students' enrollment status throughout high school. Students who had graduated or were Active in the school system at the end of the study evidenced more marked change in perceptions of social support following the transition to the ninth grade compared to Inactive students, dropouts, who evidenced little change. With respect to academic performance, while both groups evidenced declines following the transition and failed to recover sustained losses, Inactive students declined more sharply in grades and attendance. Findings are discussed in terms of the mixed support for the transitional life events perspective. In addition, study limitations and directions for future research are discussed, including variables that should be considered in research with the targeted group.",

The National Center for Education Statistics (1996) estimated that of the 12% of 16-24 year olds who had not completed high school in 1994, 8% were White, 13% were African-American, and, at 30%, the Latino(a) group had the highest dropout rate. The overall 4-year dropout rate for the public school system targeted in the current study is 44%, with minority youth's greater vulnerability relative to Whites echoed in racial/ethnic group dropout rates of 46% and 44%, respectively, for African-American and Latino(a) youth and a 39% leave rate for Whites. Dropout rates among urban versus nonurban schools further highlight the heightened risk of urban youth, indicating an 8th-to 10th-grade urban dropout rate of 8.9%, compared to 5.4% for suburban youth and 6.8% for rural youth 6.8% (U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, 1992) .",

Among the adversities they encounter are disenfranchisement from society, poor mental health, a greater likelihood of entering low-paying jobs, and unemployment (Hill & Sandfort, 1995; Reyes, 1993; Simmons, Black, & Zhou, 1991; Tidwell, 1988; Velez, 1989) . The chances of experiencing such difficulties are particularly pronounced for youth from minority and low-income backgrounds, as evidenced by their comparatively higher rates of failure and dropout (Chavez, Oetting, & Swaim, 1994; Harrison, Wilson, Pine, Chan, & Buriel, 1990 ; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1995) . Research suggests that the downward spiral that accompanies school failure is often set in motion years prior to dropouts' ultimate exit from school (Roderick, 1995) . A point of acute vulnerability is during the transition to a new school level, such as from elementary school to junior or senior high school (Felner & Adan, 1988; Roderick, 1995) .",

Inherently, such events involve substantial changes in the new environment or circumstance in which individuals find themselves. These changes require adaptation, for example, in roles and behavior. How an individual adapts to these changes is influenced by the interaction between the individual and the new environment (Brofenbrenner, 1979; Kelly, Ryan, Altman, & Stelzner, 1993; Levine & Perkins, 1987) . One factor in the adjustment equation is the characteristics of the setting or circumstance and, largely, the extent to which they differ from that of the pretransition (Kelly et al., 1993; Levine & Perkins, 1987) . On the other hand, the characteristics that individuals bring to the transition, including personality, resources, skills, and perceptions, affect their response to the new situation and contribute to their adjustment. Ultimately, adjustment is either positive and enhances the individual's resilience against future stress or negative and compromises adaptation and growth.",

For example, during the transition from elementary to high school, students encounter changes in the organizational/structural and social aspects of the setting (Eccles & Midgley, 1988) . With the increase in student body size and heterogeneity, students often lose contact with those peers who had previously been their closest friends. The new setting thus challenges them to establish a supportive peer group among a student body that is usually larger and more diverse than at the elementary level (Reyes & Hedeker, 1993) . In addition, the structure of students' school day changes, shifting from the largely nondepartmentalized classroom at the elementary level to different classes and teachers for each subject at the high school level (Eccles et al., 1993; Felner, Ginter, & Primavera, 1982; Roderick, 1995) . In this new context, students must gain the acceptance of new teachers, learn and adapt to a variety of instructional styles, and conform to a different set of rules and expectations in each of their classrooms. The development of close relationships with teachers may be inhibited by the greater number and mix of the student body (Eccles et al., 1993; Midgley, Eccles, & Feldlaufer, 1991) . Not surprisingly, students have been found to report less school-based social support at the high school level relative to the elementary level (Midgley et al., 1991) .",

Among the changes faced by students are the use of a different, usually higher, grading standard and stricter policies in terms of discipline and control (Eccles & Midgley, 1990) . The practice of a higher grading standard creates a competitive atmosphere and exerts undue pressure on students. Students may find that the effort that once earned them certain grades in the old school setting nets them lower grades in the new school setting (Eccles, Lord, & Midgley, 1991; Eccles et al., 1993; Eccles & Midgley, 1988; Wigfield, Eccles, & Pintrich, 1994) . Such a circumstance can have a demoralizing effect and compromise students' academic efforts (Eccles et al., 1993; Eccles & Midgley, 1988) . Finally, greater strictness and constraints on behavior may clash with adolescents' developing needs for autonomy and independence (Eccles et al., 1993) .",

On the one hand, there is an objective reality that includes, for example, a physical structure, teachers, and other students. On the other hand, a student's perceptions of these different school aspects will be influ-enced by both this objective reality and his/her characteristics such as attitudes, dispositions, and personality. For example, relative to the pretransition setting, the new school may in fact be much larger physically and in terms of student body size. One student may view this circumstance positively as an opportunity to meet new people. This student may make many new friends and feel a sense of belonging in the new school, which may in turn positively affect his/her school adjustment. Another student may feel intimidated and overwhelmed and respond to the new experience by withdrawing. In turn, his/her school adjustment may be negatively affected. In this vein, individual characteristics can influence perceptions, ultimately benefiting or hindering students and contributing, respectively, to positive or negative adjustment (Causey & Dubow, 1993) .",

Students are also less satisfied with teachers' instruction and view them as more strict, and less supportive and interested in their well-being. In addition, perceptions of the school environment also deteriorate, with students finding high school to be a less friendly place and reporting increased feelings of anonymity. School perceptions have in turn been linked to factors such as self-concept, grades, absenteeism, and school anxiety (Causey & Dubow, 1993) .",

For example, the urban, low-income, and racially and ethnically diverse sample in Seidman, Allen, Aber, Mitchell, and Feinman's study (1994) experienced a drop in grades following the transition to junior high school. Among these students, academic performance continued to deteriorate through the transition to senior high school. Similarly, using archival data in her study of urban, predominantly minority students, Roderick (1995) found that high school dropouts and graduates evidenced declines in grades and attendance following all school transitions. In addition, by the 10th grade, the academic profile of those students who ultimately dropped out diverged significantly from that of those who graduated. The contrast between dropouts and graduates was most evident following a school transition, particularly during the transition to high school.",

Research suggests that experiencing less change between school levels is associated with smaller declines in academic attitudes and behavior (Causey & Dubow, 1993) . Felner and his colleagues (1982) examined this idea by manipulating the amount of change that students experienced during the transition to high school. Students whose secondary school classrooms were organized and structured to more closely resemble that of their elementary school at the end of the transition year were found to outperform and hold more positive self-and school perceptions than students who experienced the regular transition. Further, the long-term impact of the differences in these groups' transition experiences is compelling. In the long run, students in the reorganized setting dropped out at a 21% rate, compared with their counterparts' 43% rate (Felner et al., 1982) . These results highlight the theorized interaction between perceptions and environmental change in the finding that experiencing less change has a beneficial effect on academic outcomes. Furthermore, they suggest that perceptions are an accurate index of the school environment. The current study examines the long-term effects that transitionrelated changes in perceptions have on final academic outcomes. Adolescents from urban, minority, low-income backgrounds were tracked from their eighth grade year in elementary school (K-8) through their transition to senior high school (9-12) and their ultimate school completion outcome. Students who had graduated or were still enrolled were compared with students who did not complete school. Comparisons were made on the degree of students' self-reported change between the eighth and the ninth grades on self-perceptions, school perceptions, perceptions of social support, and academic performance. It was hypothesized that those students who had completed school would evidence less change in academic performance and report smaller shifts in self-and school-based perceptions at the time of their eighth-to ninth-grade transition than students who did not complete school. In addition, to examine the long-term impact of grade losses, comparisons were made between students by different degrees of grade decline during the transition. It was hypothesized that students who evidenced greater declines in grade performance would be less likely to have completed school than students experiencing less decline.",

No group effects were observed in the HSTPP intervention study. Thus, as suggested by previous research, the experimental and control groups were treated as one group (Dieskova, 1984; Turnure & Thurlow, 1973) and changes over the course of the transition were examined for the overall group. Analyses from the HSTPP study revealed deteriorated school perceptions and declines in academic performance following the school transition at the end of the ninth grade. HSTPP researchers concluded that, given the highly stressed circumstances of these youths' lives, a stronger intervention was necessary to facilitate the transition to high school [see Reyes et al. (1994) for a complete description of the study].",

As with the two participating elementary schools, the majority of these 25 high schools were located in urban predominantly low-income neighborhoods and were primarily populated by Latino(a)s and African-Americans. All school types (e.g., selective, nonselective) are guided by the same Chicago Public School system policies, including a common grading standard. With respect to grading standards, while no formal policy-based differences exist by school type, it might be expected that selective schools would employ a more challenging grading standard.

Demographic information was also obtained in the eighth grade at pretransition on students' personal and family background, such as date of birth, household size, and family structure. Grade and absence data were collected from school records at the end of each semester of students' 8th through 12th grades (January and June). Enrollment status data were gathered three times a year (first and second semesters and summer) for each of students' 9th through 12th grades.

The measure was normed on a low-income, inner-city population, and internal reliabilities are reported to be above .80 (Cauce et al., 1982 (Cauce et al., , 1989 . The measure provides a list of potential sources of social support, each of which is rated in terms of three separate types of support: (1) Caring and Emotional, (2) Helpfulness and Guidance, and (3) Upset. Ratings are made on a 5-point scale, where for the first two subscales, 1 indicates lesser and 5 greater amounts of perceived support. For Upset, a rating of 1 reflects a lesser degree of upset and 5 greater upset. Sources of support were categorized in terms of the structural dimensions derived by Cauce et al. (1982) in the original development of the measure, including (1) Family (parents, siblings, and extended family), (2) Formal (teachers, school counselor, school principal, best adult friend, and clergy), and (3) Informal (best friend, other friends, boy/girlfriend, classmates). Based on an emerging and consistently supported theme in the literature that provider, rather than type, of support received is more important (Cauce et al., 1982; Licitra-Kleckler & Waas, 1993; Seidman et al., 1994) , the Caring and Emotional Support and Help and Guidance type categories were combined into a single index of ''Support.''

To measure ''change'' over the course of the transition, an index of change between the eighth and the ninth grades was calculated for each of the psychological and social adjustment measures. According to Allison (1990) , the use of change score analysis is appropriate in nonexperimental studies. For this study, change scores were calculated by subtracting pretransition (fall, eighth grade) scores from posttransition (spring, ninth grade) scores (Gillock & Reyes, 1996) . In this way, positive change scores reflect improved perceptions and performance over time, while negative change scores reflect deteriorated perceptions and declines in performance.",

Specifically, three groups were created: No-to-Minimal, Modest, and Major Decline. A maximum of half of a letter grade decline constituted the No-to-Minimal Decline group. The Modest Decline group was comprised of those students whose GPAs fell between half of a letter grade up to one and one-half letter grades.

MANOVA was used to compare Active and Inactive groups on change between the eighth and the ninth grades.

Furthermore, Analyses were also performed to examine whether differences in degree of change over time-Major, Modest, or No-to-Minimal Declineendured over the 4 years of high school. However, given the increasingly smaller number of students in these categories over time (e.g., the number of students with a Major Decline in grades by study end was 12), power considerations prohibited statistical analysis.

Findings from the current study lend inconsistent support to the idea that individuals are advantaged when there is minimal change during a transition. On the one hand, unexpectedly, students who reported greater change in perceptions of school-based social support across the transition from elementary school to high school were successful and graduated, while those who experienced generally no change in this domain dropped out. On the other hand, as predicted and in support of the transitional life events perspective, students whose grades changed less graduated at a higher rate than those students whose grades changed more dramatically.

What may seem like a minor difference in graduates' and dropouts' pretransition grades may become more salient at the high school level, where grades assume greater importance and tracking is a more prevalent practice. This may have the effect of publicizing students' academic status and heightening their awareness of it. Such a circumstance is likely avoidable at the elementary level, where grades do not assume the importance that they often do in high school and where tracking tends to be less common. An obvious and expected response in such circumstances may be distress, demoralization, and a further depressed self-concept. But students who enter high school with already depressed academic self-perceptions, such as those in the present study, are probably different from their counterparts in other ways, as suggested by the current social support findings and the course that participants' education took. Rather than become distressed, these students may have become self-protective and disengaged or, more likely, continued a process of disengagement that began prior to their transition and contributed to their lack of response to high school personnel, including the support they are or are not providing.",

At the high school level, students are part of a much larger student body and are assigned a significantly larger number of teachers than in elementary school. In such circumstances, it may be easy for students to not be noticed and feel anonymous. This may be particularly true in large school systems, such as public school systems, where teacher-student ratios can be quite high. This circumstance may further limit the opportunity for students and teachers to form close relationships. In addition, given high school teachers' large number of classrooms and students, they may be less available to students, contributing to feelings of alienation or isolation and making school seem more impersonal than what they were accustomed to at the elementary level. However, anonymity may serve an advantage for the budding adolescent whose developmental needs urge greater autonomy and freedom. While the nature of the high school setting, including its larger population size, may prompt greater strictness and constraint of autonomy as means of control (Eccles et al., 1993) , it may nonetheless be more difficult for schools to ''keep tabs'' on individual students. As such, students may perceive the high school as less restrictive. In this respect, high school may feel like a comparatively ''less upsetting'' place than the smaller, tighterknit elementary school setting, where control and tracking of students are easier.",

These students also began high school with a correspondingly positive sense of scholastic competence. Arguably, beginning high school with such resources is sufficient and, at least partially, explains graduates' success. These students were also likely equipped with related resources not assessed in this study that may have further contributed to their superior outcome and minimized adjustment stress. For example, although they might have encountered a harsher grading standard at the high school level, feeling competent and having strong academic skills may have made adjustment to such standards easier than for poorer performing students. In addition, these students might also be more ambitious and goal-oriented relative to their counterparts, making them more tolerant and proactive in dealing with adjustment stress and potentially diminishing the impact of the negative changes in school-based social support from one grade level to the next.",

However, when taking into account the trajectories that students' academic performance followed during the rest of their high school education, the significance of the transition becomes clear. Grade losses were not recuperated by students. Instead, students adhered to the general academic performance level that was established following the transition, with students who experienced declines maintaining the academic level they achieved or, in most cases, fell to in high school. This finding provides support for the poor recovery potential of students who experience grade drops (Roderick, 1995; Seidman et al., 1996) . Discriminant function analysis findings confirm the predictive power of change in grades over the school transition. Thus, in the long run, a posttransition drop of a full letter grade, as observed in this study, puts the average student dangerously close to failing, while essentially sealing the fate of the below-average student.",

One set of variables that may be relevant to transition outcomes is community contextual factors. In the current study, community, census tract, and anecdotal data confirm the prevalence of gangs, crime, and violence in the neighborhoods in which many of these students reside. For the 1997 year, citywide crime statistics revealed that the district in which the targeted population resided had the fifth highest overall rate among the city's 25 districts (Chicago Police Department, 1998) . It also ranked highly by crime type. For example, it had the second highest arson rate in the city, third highest in motor vehicle theft, and fifth and sixth highest in theft and burglary, respectively. These rates are particularly noteworthy in view of the large number of young people in the district. Twenty-nine percent of the resident population in the targeted district is 13 years of age or younger, compared with the 20% rate for the city overall. Anecdotal data included participants' report of their experience as both victims and perpetrators of assault. Further, because of the prevalence of gangs, students reported often having to take circuitous routes to school to avoid crossing into rival-gang territory. This was so even in cases where students were not gang members. That is, simply by virtue of residing in a community dominated by a rival gang was sufficient for youth to be verbally and/ or physically harassed. In view of these data, assessing students' experience of these variables in future research may shed important light on how extraneous, distal factors bear on the school experience.",

Specifically relevant are the literatures on cultural discontinuity, cultural incongruence, and cultural dissonance (Allen & Boykin, 1992; Burton, Allison, & Obeidallah, 1995; Ogbu, 1982; Rogoff & Morelli, 1989; Tharp, 1989 ). These concepts discuss the challenges faced by youth who straddle different cultures by virtue of the different environments with which they interact, including home and school. Overall, such students must learn to fit into and manage the inherent demands of two cultures which often conflict in values. Add to this the demands of the school transition and it becomes easy to see how cultural factors may be significant in the transition equation.",

This may be a disadvantage in the classroom where students are graded on participation. By the same token, many African-American children are raised with the values of interdependence and cooperation and might thus work and learn better in group contexts. However, many classrooms in the United States promote independence and encourage competition (Harrison et al., 1990) . A complicating but important factor that must also be taken into account is the issue of acculturation. Individuals who are more acculturated may be more likely to adopt mainstream values than those who are less acculturated and may in turn adapt more easily to the Anglo-American values of their new school.

First of all, the study focused on high-risk schools and communities where mobility, transfer, and dropout rates are generally high. The 36% dropout rate alone accounts for a significant loss of the sample. However, this rate approaches the 44% dropout rate for the Chicago Public School system overall (for the class of 1995, the group for whom the most recent data were available) where most of the participants attended, indicating the representativeness of the sample to the system's student population overall (Sandra Storey, Chicago Public Schools, Office of Accountability, personal communication, September 14, 1998). Lost students, whose educational outcomes could not be determined, accounted for another significant reduction in sample size. However, at least demographically, these students and study participants were not different, further allowing for some generalization of the study findings. Finally, investigators' discussion of study findings does not consider special populations (e.g., disabled students, monolingual Spanish-speaking groups), who were excluded from analyses and to whom investigators were not aiming to generalize findings. In view of these facts, the ''retention'' of 46% of the original study population reflects the realities of the targeted communities and allows for some generalizability of the current findings. Moreover, these facts highlight the significance of this work in that investigators were able to track such a group over a 6-year period despite the obstacles represented by the circumstances described here.",

As descriptive findings and longitudinal enrollment status outcomes indicate, the physical tracking of a group so chronically unstable in their academic activity poses remarkable challenge. This fact may account for the lack of attention to these groups in the research literature (Cauce, Ryan-Finn, & Grove, 2000) .

                "text": "As implications for interventions are gleaned from the study findings, the Chicago Public School system is already one step ahead in that students are limited to a single transition, from a K-8 elementary school structure to a 9-12 secondary school structure. Transition researchers have documented the advantage of fewer transitions and have noted the superior outcomes of students who make a single transition (Blyth, Simmons, and Carlton-Ford, 1983; Crockett, Petersen, Graber, Schulenberg, & Ebata, 1989; Eccles & Midgley, 1988; Seidman et al., 1996) . Nonetheless, whether one or multiple transitions are made, all groups experiencing a transition have been found to suffer declines. In this regard, school settings, students, and parents could benefit from information concerning the heightened vulnerability during transitions. Often the school transition is taken for granted, perhaps because of its normative nature. Schools might make a concerted effort toward better understanding the likelihood and extent of risks to youth during the school transition, in this way minimizing or preventing such difficulties. By the same token, schools would do well to attend to the social support needs of students. In the current study, the observed variation in social support findings illustrates the importance of tailoring support efforts to the specific needs of different groups. Although findings point to the sensitivity of students who ultimately graduate, the ''nonfinding'' concerning eventual dropouts highlights the particular vulnerability of students who show evidence of disengagement during this important milestone in their educational life.",

To determine the change score variables that best predict membership in Active and Inactive categories, a stepwise discriminant function analysis was performed. Variables entered were those on which degree of change over time differed significantly for groups, including perceptions of social support from school, perceived upset with peers and with school, and GPA. One discriminant function [ 2 (4) \u03ed 26.63, p \u03fd .05] was calculated, accurately classifying 71% of the cases. Specifically, 75% (n \u03ed 42 of 57) of the Active group and 65% (n \u03ed 30 of 50) of the Inactive group were correctly classified. Of the four change variables entered, the variable that best distinguished Active from Inactive groups was change inGPA [F(1,100)\u03ed 16.38, p \u03fd .05], followed by change in perceived upset with peers [F(1,100) \u03ed 7.53, p \u03fd .05], change in perceived school support [F(1,100) \u03ed 7.06, p \u03fd .05], and, last, change in perceived upset with school [F(1,100) \u03ed 5.54, p \u03fd .05]. Significant variables accounted for 24% of the variance. Canonical discriminant function coefficients indicate the directionality of these variables."
