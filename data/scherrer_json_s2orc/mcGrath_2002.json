Report card grades in reading and math were obtained to measure children's academic competence, and teachers' ratings of children's level of peer acceptance at school served as the indicator of social acceptance. The longitudinal data suggested that depressive symptomatology may have a negative impact on a child's ability to develop a healthy selfconcept. Self-reported depressive symptoms predicted a change in children's negative views of the self. Moreover, the self-perceptions of children who exhibited more symptoms of depression appeared to reflect an underestimation of their actual competence, as represented by the more objective indicators of performance. Children's negative self-perceptions and underestimations about the self were not associated with a subsequent change in depressive symptoms. The implications of the findings for cognitive theories of depression and future research with this population are discussed.",

Two of the most basic assumptions of the theory, that (a) cognition has causal priority over emotions, and that (b) depressed children's negative beliefs about the self reflect distortions of reality, have rarely been tested in the childhood depression literature (for reviews, see Garber, Quiggle, & Shanley, 1990; Hammen, 1990 ). The current study used a prospective longitudinal design to test associations between depressive symptoms and two dimensions of children's self-perceptions: the overall evaluation of the self and the accuracy of that judgment. First, the study tested whether negative selfperceptions are associated with subsequent increases in signs of depressive symptoms or whether the reverse is true, i.e. depressed mood predicts to a more negative view of the self. Second, estimating negative biases in children's judgments about the self, the study examined whether underestimations of competence are a risk factor for future depressive symptomatology. The reverse causal model was also tested.",

                "text": "Both children with non-clinical levels of depressive symptoms, as well as clinically depressed children, view themselves negatively. Evidence suggests that depressed children are unhappy with themselves and hold negative expectations about the future (e.g. Asarnow & Bates, 1988; McCauley, Mitchell, Burke & Moss, 1988) , do not believe they can solve their problems (Weisz, Sweeney, Proffitt & Carr, 1993) , and are critical of their academic and social competence (see Hammen, 1990; Hammen & Rudolph, 1996 for reviews) . However, there is disagreement in the childhood depression literature as to whether negative self-perceptions may lead to depression or whether depression causes a negative view of the self (Garber, Quiggle, & Shanley, 1990) . Three longitudinal studies of middle childhood and early adolescence (Robinson, Garber, & Hilsman, 1995; DuBois, Felner, Bartels, & Silverman, 1995; Hammen, 1988) found that lower self-esteem predicted a change in depressive symptoms over 6-12 months. However, none of these studies tested the reverse causal model to determine whether depressive symptoms predicted a change in self-esteem over time. Findings such as these (based on both clinical and non-clinical samples of depressed children) indicate that reports of low selfesteem may temporally precede changes in depressive symptoms and are consistent with the cognitive theory of depression. In an attempt to replicate these research findings, this study tested the hypothesis that children's negative self-perceptions predict a change in depressive symptomatology over time (Hypothesis 1). Three different components of children's selfperceptions were examined: global self-worth, self-perceived academic competence, and selfperceived social acceptance. Prior research with this age group has demonstrated the importance of assessing domain-specific judgments of competence as well as overall perceptions of one's value as a person (Harter, 1985) .",

At least four studies have found that clinically depressed children's and adolescent's self-perceptions improve as their depressive symptoms remit (Asarnow & Bates, 1988; Gotlib, Lewinsohn, Seeley, Rohde & Redner, 1993; McCauley et al., 1988; Tems, Stewart, Skinner, Hughes & Emslie, 1993) .

Cole and his colleagues (Cole, Martin, Peeke, Seroczynski, & Hoffman, 1998; Cole, Martin, Peeke, Seroczynski, & Fier, 1999) examined third through eighth graders' perceptions of their competence in several areas in relation to ratings provided by others, such as teachers, peers, and parents. There was very little support for the hypothesis that cognitive errors of underestimation are associated with a change in depressive symptoms (for the single exception, see Hoffman, Cole, Martin, Tram, & Seroczynski, in press ). However, in all but one of the analyses reported by Cole and his colleagues, depression scores at the beginning of the school year predicted children's underestimation of their own academic and social competence at the end of the school year.",

First, official report-card grades are used as the more objective indicator of academic performance, as opposed to questionnaire data collected from teachers within the context of a research study. As noted by Cole and his colleagues (Cole et al., 1999) , in order for a negative self-perception to be considered erroneous, children must receive and misinterpret positive feedback related to their competence. By using report card grades, the current approach allowed for a more direct assessment of the extent to which a child distorts information contained in feedback that was actually received about his or her academic performance. Second, the present study uses multiple reporters of children's symptoms of depression in order to gain a more comprehensive picture of children's emotional functioning. Depressive symptoms are measured by (a) children's self-reports and (b) the average of mothers' and teachers' reports of depressive symptomatology (Hoffman et al., in press , also obtained parents' reports). Third, this study extends the current literature by controlling for children's externalizing symptoms in tests of all the hypotheses in order to assess the unique association between depression and self-evaluations.",

That is, children's self-perceptions appeared to be largely independent of teachers' evaluations of their performance.",

First, assessment of distortion in the academic domain was unique in this study. Children's academic self-perceptions were compared to their report card grades, as opposed to relying on confidential questionnaire data collected from teachers specifically for the purpose of a research study. This allowed for a more direct test of the extent to which children may have ignored or distorted feedback they are known to have received when constructing their academic self-perceptions. A second advance over previous research was the explicit examination of externalizing behavior problems to determine whether these problems could account for any of the observed relationships between depressive symptoms, self-evaluations, and cognitive distortions. The findings were not attenuated when controlling for the main effect of externalizing symptoms, whether those symptoms were reported by mothers and teachers, or by the children themselves. While the specific mechanisms are unknown, it appears that mild depressive symptoms may affect how children attend to, process, and use information in their social environment in order to evaluate their own functioning.",

First, some evidence suggests that self-report measures of depression may assess negative affectivity rather than symptoms that are specific to depression (for review, see Hammen and Compas, 1994) . Similar problems relate to parent-and teacher-report measures of children's depressive symptoms (Achenbach, 1991a; 1991b) . Hence, the extent to which the present findings are specific to depressive symptomatology, or apply more generally to internalizing difficulties is unc ertain. We note, however, that children's self-reported depressive symptoms produced more reliable findings than mothers' and teachers' ratings of children's symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition, none of the results reported here changed when externalizing symptoms, whether self-or otherreported, were controlled in the analyses. This pattern of findings should also help to allay concerns that the results based on self-reported depressive symptoms might simply reflect the effects of a negative response bias.",

Rather than relying on questionnaires that ask children about hypothetical situations (e.g., see Haley et al., 1985; Leitenberg et al., 1986) In addition to these assessment limitations, there are several alternative explanations of the study's results that require discussion. First, while the findings in this non-clinical sample were inconsistent with one of the most basic assumptions of cognitive theory -that cognition has causal priority over emotions -more complex cognitive models were not tested. In particular, cognitive diathesis-stress models suggest cognitive distortions are a risk factor for depression if activated by stressful life events (e.g., Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978) . More evidence for cognitive theories of depression may have emerged in the current study if stressful events in the academic and social domains were examined. Second, in this study depression scores were more stable than were children's self-perceptions and cognitive distortions about the self, which may have contributed to the failure to predict changes in depression over one or two years.",

However, it is noteworthy that this study replicated many of the findings reported by Cole and his colleagues, which were based on a more ethnically and economically diverse sample (Cole et al., 1998; Cole et al., 1999) . Of course, the generalizability of these findings to children with clinical levels of depressive symptoms is an important question for future research. Despite these limitations, the data described here indicate that even mild symptoms of depression may precipitate a process by which preadolescents come to underestimate their competence and construct a negative view of the self. A marginally significant t-test (t (245) = 1.67, p<.10) indicated that fourth-grade boys perceived their behavior to be more problematic than did fourth-grade girls. There were significant differences in the fifth grade (t (229) = 2.73, p<.01) and in the sixth grade (t (224) = 2.58, p<.05) between boys' and girls' reports of behavior problems. indicated that teachers reported more externalizing symptoms in boys than in girls.

The items on this scale measure a child's global judgment of his or her worth as a person. Each item was scored from 1-4 and the mean of the six items was calculated. On all of the self-perception subscales, higher scores reflect more positive evaluations of the self. T-tests indicated there were no differences between girls' and boys' perceptions of global self-worth at any of the three time points.Perceptions of Scholastic Competence. The second indicator of children's selfperceptions was the 6-item scholastic competence subscale of the SPPC. The six items on this scale measure a child's perceptions of his or her academic abilities. A marginally significant ttest (t (223) = 1.73, p<.10) indicated that sixth-grade boys tended to see themselves as more academically competent than did sixth-grade girls."

                "text": "Cognitive DistortionsIn order to estimate the accuracy of judgments about the self, multiple regression analyses were conducted in which children's self-perceptions were regressed onto independent indicators of children's competence. The standardized residuals, saved as new variables, represented the components of self-perceptions that were not explained in the regression equations by the more objective indicators of children's competence. The same statistical approach was used by Cole and his colleagues (e.g., seeCole et al., 1998) to estimate children's cognitive distortions. By definition, standardized residuals have positive and negative valences, with a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. In this study, positive residual scores reflect overestimation of one's competence. Negative residual scores indicated underestimation, or cognitive distortion in a negative direction. Distortion in the Academic Domain. At each time point, residuals reflecting distortion in the academic domain were obtained by simultaneously regressing perceptions of academic competence onto grades in reading and math. In fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade, higher grades in reading and math were associated with perceptions of more academic competence. A significant portion of the variance in perceived academic competence was explained by grades in reading"

The effects of gender and cohort were examined throughout tests of the hypotheses by controlling for the main effects of child sex and cohort and by testing the interactions between child sex and the predictor variable and between cohort and the predictor variable. None of the interactions were significant.Negative Self-Perceptions and Depressive Symptoms Hypothesis 1 The first hypothesis stated that children's negative self-evaluations would predict a change in depressive symptomatology over time. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses tested Hypothesis 1 separately for children's perceptions of their global self-worth, their scholastic competence, and their social competence. Three longitudinal tests (T1-T2, T2-T3, and T1-T3) were conducted with each of the three indicators of children's negative self-perceptions (the predictor variable), resulting in a total of (3x3) 9 tests of Hypothesis 1.Of the 9 tests, only two were significant (seeTables 2 and 3). Perceptions of academic competence in fourth-grade predicted a significant change in children's self-reported depressive symptoms from fourth-to fifth-grade. In addition, children's perceptions of social competence in fourth-grade were associated with a significant change in self-reported depressive symptoms from fourth-to sixth-grade. The negative betas suggested that children with perceptions of less competence experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms over time. The other 7 tests of Hypothesis 1 were not significant (see"

Moreover, the pattern of results was not attenuated by controlling for the main effect of externalizing symptoms.Additional analyses tested Hypothesis 2 using mother-and teacher-reported depressive symptoms instead of the CDI, and three out of nine tests were statistically significant. Otherrated depressive symptoms in fourth-grade predicted a significant change in children's perceptions of academic competence from fourth-to sixth-grade (b= -.13, p<.05). In addition, other-rated depressive symptoms predicted a significant change in children's perceptions of social competence from fifth-to sixth-grade (b= -.11, p<.05) and from fourth-to sixth-grade (b= -.12, p<.05). The negative betas suggested that mothers' and teachers' reports of more depressive symptoms predicted more negative self-perceptions over time. In summary, clear and convincing evidence emerged to support the hypothesis that self-reported depressive symptomspredict a change in children's negative self-evaluations over time. Less evidence emerged when using other-rated depressive symptoms as the predictor variable. Cognitive Distortions and Depressive Symptoms Hypothesis 3 The third hypothesis stated that children's underestimations of their competence would predict a change in depressive symptomatology over time. A total of three longitudinal tests of Hypothesis 3 (T1-T2, T2-T3, and T1-T3) were conducted in which the predictor variable was distortion in the academic domain. Distortion in the academic domain did not predict a change in self-reported depressive symptoms in any of the analyses (see"
