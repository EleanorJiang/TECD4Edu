This study proposes that students' sense of belonging in middle school and their endorsement of social responsibility, relationship, and status goals in that setting should explain, in part, changes in their achievement goal orientations between 5th and 6th grades. Longitudinal survey data from 660 students indicated that, on average, endorsement of personal task goals declined, whereas endorsement of ability goals increased across the transition. Increases in task goal orientation were associated with perceiving both a task and an ability goal structure in 6th grade classes, along with sense of school belonging, and endorsing responsibility goals. Increases in ability goal orientation were associated positively with perceiving an ability goal structure in classes, with relationship and status goals, and negatively with school belonging.",

These declines have been linked to changes in the classroom environment (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Eccles & Midgley, 1989; Midgley, Feldlaufer, & Eccles, 1989a,b) . Typically, the focus of such research has been on characteristics of the academic environment of schooling; however, students' social perceptions and goals also can be expected to influence their motivation within a new school setting (Goodenow, 1992) .

In general, research indicates that perceptions of a task or mastery goal stress in the classroom are related to more adaptive patterns of learning than are perceptions of a stress on ability and performance. Thus when teachers emphasize improvement, effort, and learning for intrinsic reasons, students are likely to adopt personal task goals; in contrast, when teachers emphasize grades, ability differences, and outperforming others, students are likely to adopt personal ability goals. For example, Ames and Archer (1988) found that students who perceived an emphasis on task goals in their classrooms used more effective learning strategies than did students who perceived a stress on ability goals. Anderman and Young (1994) demonstrated that teachers' use of ability-oriented instructional practices (e.g., pointing out the work of the best students as examples to others) was related to lower levels of personal mastery (task) goals in science. Urdan, Midgley, and Anderman (1998) found that the peception of a stress on ability and performance in elementary school classrooms was related to greater use of academic self-handicapping strategies. In the present study, it was expected that perceptions of a task goal structure in 6th grade classes (after the transition to middle school) would predict an increase in students' personal task goal orientation, relative to their goals in 5th grade (during elementary school), whereas perceptions of an ability goal structure would increase their personal ability goal orientations.",

Students who report high levels of pursuing responsibility goals have been shown to receive higher grades in school (Wentzel, 1989 (Wentzel, , 1993 , although the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. One possible explanation is that responsibility goals are associated with adaptive patterns of achievement motivation. For example, Patrick et al. (1997) reported that students who endorse responsibility goals have higher perceived self-efficacy for academic work than do their peers. It may be that, compared to their peers, students who report the desire and willingness to adhere to the social expectations of schooling are thus more willing to endorse the importance of learning, personal improvement, and the exertion of personal effort in their school work. In contrast, those who are unable or unwilling to conform to the formal social rules of schooling may be less likely to view academic achievement in those terms. Thus, in this study, we propose that endorsement of responsibility goals in middle school may be related to a personal task goal orientation.",

That is, individuals for whom peer relationships and status are especially salient may be more inclined than other students to look to the peer group for evidence of their academic success, also. Currently, there is little empirical research to support this hypothesis. There is some evidence, however, that the endorsement of social status goals is associated with students' use of self-regulatory strategies in class. For example, Ryan, Hicks, and Midgley (1997) reported that students' endorsement of social status goals predicted their self-reported reluctance to seek help with academic work and their perception that help-seeking was associated with a threat to self-worth. That is, students who were concerned with their peer popularity were more likely to be concerned about classmates' judgments of their academic ability.

Previous studies examining gender differences in adolescents' academic goals have yielded mixed results. There is some evidence, however, that boys may be more likely than girls to endorse personal ability goals (Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Ryan et al., 1997) . In terms of social goals, findings from several studies indicate that girls endorse relationship and responsibility goals more than do boys (e.g., Hicks et al., 1995; Patrick et al., 1997; Ryan et al., 1997) , whereas boys endorse status goals more than do girls (Ryan et al., 1997) . To date, however, little is known about potential gender differences in the relative importance of social variables in predicting students' achievement goal orientations. Therefore, a secondary aim of this study was to examine potential interactions between students' gender and their social perceptions in relation to their academic goals.",

Specifically, the intent was to identify the unique contributions of students' sense of school belonging and their endorsement of social goals when variables identified as important by previous research were taken into account. A measure of academic performance also was included to control for the possibility that high-and low-achieving students might perceive the transition to middle school differently. It was expected that, consistent with previous research (e.g., Anderman & Young, 1994) , students' perceptions of the goal structures in their classes would predict their endorsement of personal task and ability goal orientations. It also was hypothesized that students who reported a sense of school belonging, and who endorsed goals for being responsible class members in their new school, would be likely to report an increased task goal orientation in middle school. In contrast, it was expected that students who endorsed goals for forming peer relationships and for maintaining social status in the peer group would be more likely than other young adolescents to report an increased ability goal orientation.",

Classes were heterogeneous in terms of academic ability, and students remained with the same group of peers throughout the school day. In contrast, the middle schools in this study utilized a departmentalized or semidepartmentalized structure. According to principals' reports, a typical student would see at least two teachers a day in every school, while in four of the schools students might see four or more. In addition, classes were tracked for ability in five schools for Math and in four for English. Other indicators of an increased emphasis on academic grades and social comparison in all of the middle schools included practices such as displaying an academic honor roll in the school building and restricting school sports participation on the basis of academic criteria.",

Furthermore, students' sense of school belonging and endorsement of social goals in 6th grade explained additional variance in their achievement goals. The analysis for students' personal task goal orientations is shown in Table  3 . In the first step of this analysis, task goal orientation in 5th grade was a significant predictor (\u03b2 \u03ed .55, p \u03fd .001). This variable, along with students' gender and prior achievement, accounted for 30% of the variance in the outcome.

Second, the current study supports the notion that students' perceptions of the goals emphasized in the classroom predict their adoption of personal goal orientations (Anderman & Young, 1994) . The present study adds to the literature, however, by indicating that both task and ability goal orientations are related to the goals emphasized in the classroom (the study by Anderman & Young, 1994 only examined relationships of classroom goals stresses to learning goals). The current study also adds to the literature on changes in students' motivation across the transition to middle level schools in that it demonstrates that students' social perceptions in 6th grade made significant, unique contributions to their achievement goal orientations. These effects were found when students' previous goal orientations, GPA, and perceptions of classroom goal structures were taken into account. Whereas the social environment of classrooms has been proposed as an important contributor to students' adaptation to middle school (e.g., Eccles & Midgley, 1989) , few studies have examined directly the relation between students' social perceptions and their academic motivation across the transition to middle school. Social concerns, generally important in early adolescence, may be particularly salient during this period as students negotiate a new school environment.",

The current results, however, help to clarify this relation in that students' sense of school belonging was predictive of an increased task goal orientation and was modestly associated with a decrease in ability goal orientation. That is, students who reported feeling accepted and ''a part of'' their new school were more likely to pursue their academic work for the purposes of personal understanding and increased competence. A similar pattern of effects was evident for students who endorsed social responsibility goals. Given that a task goal orientation is theoretically and empirically linked to the use of more adaptive learning strategies (Ames, 1992; Nolen, 1988; Nolen & Haladyna, 1990; Pintrich & De Groot, 1990) , these findings may provide an explanation for previously reported evidence that responsibility goals are associated with higher grades in school (Wentzel, 1989) . That is, endorsement of responsibility goals may have an indirect effect on students' learning strategies, mediated through an academic task goal orientation. This suggestion remains the subject for future research.",

Indeed, the influence of peers during early adolescence, particularly after the transition from elementary to middle school, is an extremely important consideration in the study of adolescents' academic motivation (e.g., Berndt & Keefe, 1992; Hicks, 1997; Wentzel, 1991b) . It may be that students who are more focused on their social relationships and reputations among their peers are also more likely to look to their peer group for evidence of their own academic success and achievement. The peer group is not only more salient for such individuals as a social network, but also as a comparison group against which to assess their own performance. Thus, there may be an increased tendency to adopt an ability goal orientation in academic situations.",

These differences were consistent with those that have been reported elsewhere (e.g., Hicks et al., 1995; Patrick et al., 1997; Ryan et al., 1997) , and with earlier research that suggested that boys may be more likely to engage in social comparison than are girls (e.g., Ruble, Parsons, & Ross, 1976; Spear & Armstrong, 1978) . It is interesting to note, however, that students' gender was not a significant predictor of their goal orientations in 6th grade in the final regression analyses. That is, gender did not have a unique effect in the presence of the other academic and social motivational variables. Furthermore, there were no significant interaction effects between any predictors and students' gender. Consequently, whereas girls and boys may differ in the extent to which they perceive teachers as emphasizing relative ability or endorse goals for making friends at school, the results of the current study do not indicate that those perceptions and goals operate differently in relation to personal academic goals.",

This study also reinforces, however, the importance of attending to the social aspects of students' transition experiences to gain a fuller understanding of young adolescents' motivation in school. During early adolescence, social influences operate in a variety of ways, both through instructional techniques and strategies designed by teachers and through the myriad of interactions that early adolescents have with one another. In terms of instruction, the increased emphasis on sociocultural approaches to learning and instruction in general (e.g., Englert & Mariage, 1996) , as well as to the use of socially oriented instructional practices such as cooperative learning techniques (e.g., Slavin, 1983) emphasize the need for teachers to attend to social variables in their classrooms.",
