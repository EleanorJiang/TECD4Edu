The results of SEM analysis showed that previous math skills predicted positively math interest and negatively performance-avoidance goals at Grade 3. Also, Grade 2 performance-avoidance goals were negatively related to subsequent interest towards math. Comparing low-ability students with other students indicated that Grade 3 interest was positively predicted by previous skills, and negatively by performance-approach and-avoidance goals specifically in low-ability group.

While decreases in academically adaptive achievement goals and increases in maladaptive achievement goals have been explored (for an overview see Wigfield, Eccles, & Rodriguez, 1998) the factors contributing to these changes in motivational constructs are not fully understood for primary grades.",

Although the crucial role of math skills in the later school achievement in general is acknowledged (Duncan et al., 2007; Siegler et al., 2012) there is a lack of longitudinal studies focusing on the relation between math skills, interest and goals. Understanding the relations between motivational constructs and academic skills, specifically in the early school years, can help support students' later academic development. Interrelations among interest, performance goals, and academic achievement have been recently examined (e.g., Conley, 2012; Hulleman, Durik, Schweigert, & Harackiewicz, 2008) , but these studies have not targeted students under the age of 10 (according to the review by Huang, 2011) . Also, only a few studies have been carried out to assess the longitudinal reciprocal relationship between single motivation constructs and math skills in primary grades in recent years (Hirvonen, Tolvanen, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2012; M\u00e4gi, Lerkkanen, Poikkeus, Rasku-Puttonen, & Kikas, 2010; Viljaranta, Lerkkanen, Poikkeus, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2009) . To the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined the relations between interest, achievement goals, and skills simultaneously. Integration of the most studied and somewhat overlapping theories, the treatment of interest value from expectancy-value theory (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) and performance goals from achievement goal theory (Pintrich, 2000) , enables to cover motivational patterns of young students more comprehensively than just drawing on one framework (e.g. Hulleman et al., 2008; Spinath & Spinath, 2005) .",

The effect of general ability or intelligence on achievement appears to be stronger than the effect of motivational constructs (Gagn\u00e9 & St P\u00e8re, 2001; Spinath et al., 2006) . Still, the effect of motivational constructs on achievement is of greater practical interest, as these constructs are more easily modifiable than abilities (e.g., Midgley, Anderman, & Hicks, 1995) . Besides the direct effect of ability on achievement, relations between motivation and achievement may differ in groups of students with different general abilities. For instance, intelligence has been shown to moderate the effect of motivation-regulation strategies on achievement in high school students (Schwinger, Steinmayr, & Spinath, 2009) . Relations between motivation and achievement have been examined in groups of children with different skill levels (e.g., Bodovski & Farkas, 2007) . Other authors have raised questions about group differences in motivational patterns and their relations with academic skills in the context of poorer school achievement (Wentzel & Wigfield, 2007) . These works pose a question of whether mutual relations between motivational constructs and academic skills differ in different general ability groups during primary grades. As low-ability students are specifically vulnerable for school failure, understanding these relations may lead to strategies supporting their academic development during the early school years.",

So, interest can be perceived as doing something because of liking and enjoyment, as it is accompanied by attention, concentration, and positive affect (Hidi, 2006) . With added school years, interest in math tends to decline (Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Frenzel, Goetz, Pekrun, & Watt, 2010) , but this decline is not shown as unavoidable during the early school years (Wigfield et al., 1997) . Interestingly, it is proposed that changes in math interest across the school years are related to changes in math achievement (Gottfried, Marcoulides, Gottfried, Oliver, & Guerin, 2007) . Children with higher math skills might enjoy completing tasks because they get positive feedback that in turn creates positive feelings and higher selfconfidence (cf. Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, & Wigfield, 2002) . Thus, they may also become more interested in doing math. Higher interest supports engagement, achievement and persistence in completing school tasks Renninger, Even, & Lasher, 2002) . Studies have confirmed that the development of interest and skills in math are in the long term interrelatedthe children who become more interested in subject matter acquire better skills, and children with better skills become more interested in subject matter later on (e.g., Aunola, Leskinen, & Nurmi, 2006; Fisher et al., 2012; Viljaranta et al., 2009) .",

For others, the actual effects of relations found between math interest and achievement have been from nonsignificant and weak to moderate (Aunola et al., 2006; Bouffard et al., 2003; Fisher et al., 2012; Gottfried, 1990; Spinath et al., 2006; Viljaranta et al., 2009) . It could be that, interest plays a higher role for children with low general ability, as they struggle with school tasks more than their abler peers. Renninger et al. (2002) argued in their qualitative study that interest might be something that helps low-ability students stay on track when learning, thereby improving their skills. So far, stronger relations between motivational constructs and achievement have been found in children with low academic pre-skills as compared with children with average or high skills. Namely, Bodovski and Farkas (2007) found that kindergarten students' effortful learning behavior (as evaluated by kindergarten teachers and related with motivation) had the largest effect on math achievement in primary grades for students in the group with the lowest preliminary math skills. However, no studies have examined whether relations between interest and achievement are different in children with low general ability as compared to other children.",

More precisely, in achievement goal theory, students' personal goals are divided into mastery and performance goal orientations (Elliott & Dweck, 1988) with approach and avoidance dimensions (Elliot, 1999; Elliot & McGregor, 2001 ). Orientation to mastery goals (also called task or learning goals) refers to improving knowledge and understanding learned material as learning outcomes. Performance goals (also called ego or ability goals) focus on demonstrating one's competence, comparing oneself with others, and being concerned about giving an impression to others (Elliott & Dweck, 1988; Wigfield & Cambria, 2010) . Students with performance-approach goals have a desire to obtain good results and to show that they outperform their peers. Students with performance-avoidance goals wish to avoid negative judgments and a perception of being less smart than other students (Midgley et al., 1998) . These goals play a role in students' behavior, in learning situations and in learning outcomes, as early as the primary grades (Pintrich, 2003; Smiley & Dweck, 1994) .",

This may be related to difficulties of assessing goals in young children. Still, it seems important to study children's own evaluations of their goals. For instance, Ross, Shannon, Salisbury-Glennon, and Guarino (2002) showed that a three-factor structure for mastery, performanceapproach, and performance-avoidance goals holds up for both college and fourth grade students in the United States. Moreover, Bong (2009) showed that a four-factor model (mastery-performance and approach-avoidance dimensions) was applicable in Korean Grades 3-9. Still, in both studies, a developmental trend with the factors being less distinct in younger than older students was found, thus suggesting the need to be careful with interpretations. Using questionnaires, achievement goals have also been assessed in primary grades in Estonia, Germany, and Turkey (see respectively, M\u00e4gi, Lerkkanen, et al., 2010; Paulick, Watermann, & N\u00fcckles, 2013; Sungur & Senler, 2010) . As in previously conducted studies in Estonia mastery goals have not been found to be related to achievement (Kikas, Peets, Palu, & Afanasjev, 2009; M\u00e4gi, Lerkkanen et al., 2010) , we limited our study to examine only performance goals.",

Promoting performance approach goals at the classroom level has led to improvement of math test scores in upper elementary schools, although a negative relationship between personal approach goals and later achievement has been shown (Linnenbrink, 2005) . On the other hand, Bong (2009) has suggested that performance-approach goals might become important in promoting learning starting in middle school. In primary grades, M\u00e4gi, Lerkkanen, et al. (2010) did not find any effect of performance-approach goals on math grades or skills. However, in another study, performance-approach goals were measured, without the context of a subject, and were shown to be related to students' taskavoidance behavior, which in turn predicted lower achievement (M\u00e4gi, H\u00e4idkind, & Kikas, 2010) . Moreover, in middle school, students with higher performance-approach goals have been shown to set higher performance-avoidance goals for the subsequent year (Middleton, Kaplan, & Midgley, 2004) . Thus, the effect of performance-approach goals on achievement may be mediated by other constructs.",

The same has been found for relations of performance-avoidance goals and intrinsic motivation in general (e.g., Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996; Elliot & Murayama, 2008) . Although recent reviews have emphasized the need for research on interests and goals in different age groups and learning contexts (Renninger & Hidi, 2011; Wigfield & Cambria, 2010) , to our best knowledge, no longitudinal studies have explored the relationship of interest and performance goals with skills in math in the early school years.

Middle school studies have revealed that relations between interest and performance goals are still somewhat unclear. For example, Liem, Lau and Nie (2008) reported a negative relation between interest and performanceavoidance goals in English language classes. On the other hand, performance-approach goals were found to affect neither interest nor achievement, and performance-avoidance goals had a negative effect on math achievement but not on interest . Conley (2012) used a person-centered approach in studying math-related goals, task values, and later achievement and concluded that integrating goals and task value is more likely to predict achievement than is a single motivational predictor. In German secondary schools, Steinmayr and Spinath (2009) showed that when analyzed together and controlled for previous achievement, interest predicted math achievement beyond intelligence, and performance goals did not. In the primary school context, it has been shown that supporting children's interest and task-focused goals enhances math achievement, especially in children with lower previous math skills (Fuchs et al., 1997) . So far, relations between interest, performance goals, and skills have not been compared in groups of children with different ability levels.",

We assumed that interest and performance goals autoregressively predict the same constructs for the next school year (Hypothesis 1a; Middleton et al., 2004; Wigfield et al., 1997) . According to studies in middle and high schools, we expected to find mutual positive relations between interest and performanceapproach goals (Hypothesis 1b) and negative relations between interest and performance-avoidance goals (Hypothesis 1c; Conley, 2012; Liem, Lau, & Nie, 2008; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . Since Bong (2009) reported a positive relation between a performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals in math in elementary school and since Middleton et al. (2004) reported that higher performance-approach goals predict higher subsequent performance-avoidance goals in middle school, we assumed that these goals might have mutually positive relations (Hypothesis 1d). 2. How do the math-related interest, performance goal and math skills mutually affect one another from second to third grades when the students' pre-skills in math in the beginning of the school year are taken into account? Previous research has led to controversial results regarding the predictive power of young students' interest on school achievement and vice versa. Studies have shown mutual relations between interest and math skills (Aunola et al., 2006; Viljaranta et al., 2009) . We expected that interest and performance-approach goals predict subsequent skills positively and performanceavoidance goals predict the skills negatively (Hypothesis 2a; Fisher et al., 2012) . Math skills were expected to be positive predictors of math related interest and performance-approach goals and negative predictors of performance-avoidance goals (Hypothesis 2b; Fisher et al., 2012; Kikas et al., 2009 ) when controlling for the initial level of math skills (see Aunola, Leskinen, Lerkkanen, & Nurmi, 2004; Duncan et al., 2007) . 3. Do the relations between interest, performance goals, and math skills differ for children with lower abilities compared to other children? Relying on earlier related studies (Bodovski & Farkas, 2007; Fuchs et al., 1997; Renninger et al., 2002) , we expected that mutual relations between skills and motivational constructs (interest, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals) would be stronger in the group of low ability than in the group of other children (Hypothesis 3).",

We found some crucial differences between low-ability children and comparison group, as shown in Fig. 2 . First, Time 2 skills were a significantly stronger predictor of Time 3 interest for low-ability children (\u03b2 = .37, p = .001) compared to the rest of the sample (\u03b2 = .09, p = .097), \u0394\u03c7 2 = 4.075; \u0394df = 1, p = .044. Unlike our initial model, the results indicated a predictive relationship between Time 2 performance-approach goals and Time 3 interest in the sample of lowability students (\u03b2 = .29, p = .026) compared to the rest of the sample (\u03b2 = .03, p = .551), \u0394\u03c7 2 = 3.893; \u0394df = 1, p = .048. Both results show that performance goals and skills in primary grades have more influence on the further interest of children with lower abilities. We also found that the path from skills at Time 2 to performance-avoidance goals at Time 3 was stronger for the low-ability group than for comparison group (\u03b2 = \u2212.31, p = .017 for low-ability group, \u03b2 = \u2212.07, p = .227 for comparison group); however, comparing the models showed no significant difference.

The results showed, first, that interest and performance goals in math are relatively stable from the second to the third grades. This is in accordance with previous studies on interest (Hypothesis 1a; Wigfield et al., 1997) and performance goals (M\u00e4gi, Lerkkanen et al., 2010) in primary grades. Moreover, performance-avoidance goals at Grade 2 predicted interest in math negatively in the following grade. Thus, students who wished to avoid being perceived as less smart in math class tended to be less interested in math during the following school year, even when considering their previous interest, performance-approach goals, and skills. Our results revealed a similar finding for primary grades as was shown for undergraduate students' intrinsic motivation (Elliot & Church, 1997) . We also expected (Hypotheses 1b and 1c; Conley, 2012; Liem et al., 2008; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) that students with higher math interest in Grade 2 set more performance-approach and fewer performance-avoidance goals in Grade 3. However, while higher interest was related to higher performance-approach and lower performance-avoidance goals within the school year both in Grades 2 and 3, interest did not predict goals in the subsequent year. The same pattern was evident in the relations between performance-approach and avoidance goals (Hypothesis 1d). Although, in accordance with Bong (2009) , performance goals were positively related to each other within the school year, we did not find one predicting another in the next grade or vice versa. Therefore, we revisited the results of M\u00e4gi, Lerkkanen et al. (2010) of relations between achievement goals and effort.",

Results indicated that young students' interest in math depends on their previous performance-avoidance goals and skills, and the latter also predicts subsequent performance-avoidance goals. Relations between motivation and skills may be stronger for young students with lower abilities.",
