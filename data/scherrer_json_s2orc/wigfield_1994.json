Self-esteem is thought to develop during the elementary and middle school years, although researchers have debated how early children can make the kinds of general self-evaluations that are the basis of self-esteem. Harter (1983) suggested that children cannot make these kinds of self-evaluations until they are 8 or older. By contrast, Marsh, Craven, and Debus (1991) have argued that even 5-year-old children can make such judgments. Many authors (e.g., Erikson, 1963; Harter, 1990; Rosenberg, 1986; Simmons, Rosenberg, & Rosenberg, 1973) have discussed how the early adolescent years are a time of adjustment and perhaps disturbance in children's general self-esteem.",

Researchers interested in subjective task value argue that both competence beliefs and values are needed to understand achievement behavior and task choice. For instance, even though children may believe they are competent at a given activity and can efficaciously perform it, they may not engage in it if they do not value the activity. In their expectancy-value model of achievement choice, Eccles et al. (1983) proposed four major components of achievement values: attainment value or importance, intrinsic value, utility value or usefulness of the task, and cost (see Eccles et al., 1983; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992 , for more detailed discussion of these components). Building on the Battle (1965 Battle ( , 1966 work, Eccles et al. (1983) defined attainment value as the importance of doing well on a given task. Intrinsic value is the enjoyment one gains from doing the task; this component is similar to notions of intrinsic motivation (see Deci & Ryan, 1985; Harter, 1981) . Utility value or usefulness refers to how a task fits into an individual's future plans, for instance, taking a math class to fulfill a requirement for a science degree. Also, cost has to do with the negative aspects of doing a task, such as how doing one task (e.g., homework) influences time available to do other tasks (e.g., calling friends).",

In this article two major longitudinal studies in which actual change in children's competence beliefs, achievement values, and general selfesteem across elementary and junior high school are presented. The major focus of the article is on change in early adolescents' beliefs and values during the middle grades years; change during elementary school is described to put those findings in context. Possible explanations of the (generally) negative changes iri these beliefs found in this work are explored. These explanations focus on two main things, changes in children's processing of the evaluative feedback they receive in school and contextual changes in the kinds of school and classroom environments children experience as they move through school.",

Nicholls (1979) found that 6and 8-year-old children ranked their reading ability relative to others in their class as very high, but 10-and 12-year-olds' rankings were both lower and more varied. Parsons and Ruble (1977) found that 5-to 7-year-old children reported quite high expectations for their future achievements, whereas older children reported more modest expectations, particularly after experiencing some failure at the task. In cross-sectional studies of children at all the elementary grades including kindergarten, Marsh (1989) and Marsh et al. (1991) reported that older elementary school-aged children had less positive self-concepts of ability in several academic and nonacademic domains than did younger elementary school-aged children. Recently, Eccles, Wigfield, Harold, and Blumenfeld (1993) found that younger children (first and second graders) had more positive competence beliefs in the domains of math, reading, and instrumental music than did fourth-grade children. Although other recent work shows that some young children are quite vulnerable to failure (Heyman, Dweck, & Cain, 1992) , the general pattern appears to be that younger children's selfreported competence beliefs are more positive than those of older children.",

Children's interest in instrumental music and reading decreased over time, but their interest in math and sports did not (see Figure 3 for the means). Another way children's interest in the activities differed from their ratings of the activities' usefulness and importance is in their rank orderings. At all times of measurement, children's interest in sports was much higher than their interest in any of the other activities. It appears that academic activities do not hold elementary school-aged children's interest the way that sports does, a finding that is not particularly surprising! In contrast, children rated the academic subject areas of reading and math as Children's continuing interest in sports despite the drop in their competence beliefs and ratings of its usefulness and importance may mean that during elementary school the fun of sports activities overrides the decline in their sense of how good they are, at least until the end of elementary school.",

In addition, the gender differences in math competence beliefs are discouraging, particularly because they emerge so early during the elementary school years-first grade (see also . These gender differences in competence beliefs emerge despite the fact that in this sample teachers rate girls and boys as equally able in math (see Harold et al., 1989) . Girls seem to doubt their ability in math during elementary school even though they outperform boys in math during elementary school and junior high school (Linn & Hyde, 1989) . Cultural stereotypes about females and math continue to have a strong influence on girls' math competence beliefs. Although boys reported greater interest in sports than did girls relative to the other activities both boys and girls reported being most interested in sports; sports activities have great appeal for children of these ages. In contrast, girls were much more interested in instrumental music than were boys and had higher instrumental music competence beliefs. However, males are much more likely than females to have careers as musicians in rock bands, jazz groups, and orchestras, despite these early gender differences in instrumental music competence beliefs and values favoring girls (see for further discussion).",

Marsh (1989) also reported few gender-by-age interactions through elementary and middle grades school in children's self-concepts in different domains. These findings are another indication of the continuing strong role of sex-role stereotypes on observed gender differences.

During this time period, early adolescents face many important changes, including the social and biological changes associated with puberty. Traditionally these changes were thought to make early adolescence a very difficult time period (e.g., Blos, 1979) . Many researchers now believe that the characterization of this time period as one of storm and stress is a great overstatement (i.e., Brooks-Gunn & Reiter, 1990; Buchanan, Eccles, & Becker, 1992 ). This is not to deny the importance of the biological changes that do occur and their potential impact on psychological processes, however. Most early adolescents also make an important school transition at this time, moving from elementary to middle school or junior high school. Different theorists (e.g., Eccles, Midgley, & Adler, 1984; Hill & Lynch, 1983; Rosenberg, 1986; Simmons & Blyth, 1987) have proposed that these school environmental changes can have a significant impact on students' selfbeliefs.",

Hill and Lynch (1983) labeled this phenomenon gender-role intensification. The intensification of pressure to conform to gender role appropriate activities may lead early adolescents to have less positive beliefs and be less involved in activities that they see as less appropriate to their own gender. Although children's self-beliefs do seem to become more negative at early adolescence, there has been some debate about the magnitude of these negative changes, especially in the case of students' general self-esteem. Longitudinal studies of children's self-esteem during adolescence show that it actually increases across adolescence (Dusek & Flaherty, 1981; O'Malley & Bachman, 1983) , even across the transition to junior high school (Nottelmann, 1987) . Although the Simmons et al. (1973) cross-sectional work indicates that children's self-esteem decreases at early adolescence, their longitudinal work (e.g., Blyth et al., 1983; Simmons et al., 1979) shows that for most children, self-esteem scores increase across adolescence. In their work, the only group to show consistent evidence of decline in self-esteem is White girls who make the transition to junior high school.",

In contrast, early adolescents' competence beliefs and valuing of different academic activities should show only moderate changes immediately following the transition to junior high school.

These beliefs should decline immediately after the transition and increase across seventh grade. In contrast, early adolescents' liking of social activities should increase during seventh grade due to the salience of peer acceptance in early adolescence (Berndt, 1987) . Changes in early adolescents' competence beliefs and valuing of the sports domain are more difficult to predict. Early adolescents' ability beliefs in this area may decrease following the junior high transition because of the larger social comparison group they encounter in junior high. However, because sports activities often take place out of the school context, this transition may have little effect on students' sports competence beliefs.",

In sixth grade, the students are the oldest students in their schools and so are likely to have the most status. They know their school routines well and the school environment is familiar to them. Thus their self-esteem is quite high during the spring of their sixth-grade year. In seventh grade, the students are the youngest children in their school and are adjusting to their new school environment. This adjustment period may produce the temporary drop in their self-esteem in the fall of the seventh-grade year. These findings complement and extend those from previous studies. These longitudinal data confirm the cross-sectional findings (Simmons et al., 1979; Simmons et al., 1973 ) that children's self-esteem is lower immediately after the transition to junior high. However, as mentioned earlier and found by others (Nottelmann, 1987) , the students' self-esteem increased during the seventh-grade year; thus the disruption in self-esteem was not long lasting. As students go through high school, their self-esteem should increase further, as found by O'Malley and Bachman (1983) , and Dusek and Flaherty (1981) .",

As predicted, early adolescents' mathematics, English, social, and sports competence beliefs became more negative immediately following the junior high transition (see Figure 4 for the means). Their social (and to a lesser extent) sports competence beliefs rebounded over the seventh-grade year. The marked decline in the adolescents' social competence beliefs between Waves 2 and 3 illustrates the impact of the transition to junior high on these beliefs. This decline probably occurs because the transition disrupts early adolescents' social networks (Berndt, 1987) , at a time when social activities are becoming increasingly important (see Hartup, 1983) . As these networks are reestablished over the course of the school year, the adolescents' confidence appears to rise. However, their social competence beliefs did not return to the level of the spring of the sixth grade. This finding suggests that some early adolescents still lack confidence in their social abilities. Work by Simmons and her colleagues (e.g., Simmons & Blyth, 1987; Simmons et al., 1973) have found that some early adolescents never regain their pretransition levels of self-confidence. Similar to cross-sectional results reported by Marsh (1989) , early adolescents' beliefs about their physical competence are lower in seventh than in sixth grade. Because this decline in sports competence beliefs begins at Wave 2 prior to the transition to junior high, changes in instructional practices in physical education courses following the transition to junior high are not the most likely explanation for the observed changes. In the communities represented in this study, sports teams become more selective during this time period. Perhaps early adolescents feel less competent at sports because of these increases in the competitiveness of sports occurring at this time (see Duda, Olson, & Templin, 1991) .",

Similar findings have been reported by other researchers (e.g., Blyth et al., 1983; Nottelmann, 1987; Simmons et al., 1979) . It is unclear whether this finding reflects actual gender differences in self-esteem or response bias because boys tend to be more positive than girls in their responses to self-report measures, and girls may be more modest in their self-reports (Eccles, Adler, & Meece, 1984) . These differences contrast with the findings for elementary school children, where there were no differences in boys' and girls' self-esteem. Rosenberg (1986) suggested that girls are more affected by the physical changes occurring at puberty and thus their self-concepts are more volatile than those of boys during this time period. Although there were gender differences in self-esteem, they were consistent over time, and so these results do not support this suggestion. These findings did not replicate the pattern of gender differences reported by Simmons and Blyth (1987) , who found that the junior high transition had a negative effect only on girls' self-esteem. Whether this difference reflects sample differences, measure differences, or some more substantive differences remains unclear. Many gender differences in beliefs about the different activities were observed; Table 2 presents the means. Boys have higher competence beliefs for sports and math than do girls, and girls have higher competence beliefs for English. These gender differences in competence beliefs confirm and extend previous cross-sectional work (e.g., Eccles et al., 1983; Marsh, 1989; Wigfield, 1984) . For importance, boys rated sports as a more important activity than did girls whereas girls did so for English and social activities. The gender differences in perceived interest in English, social activities, and sports activities followed prediction: As predicted, boys report liking sports more than girls do, whereas girls report liking social interactions and English more than boys. There were no gender differences in either liking of math or ratings of its importance.",

However, as discussed earlier, the fact that girls have less positive views of their ability in math could be problematic. If these trends continue into high school as previous studies suggest (e.g., Eccles et al., 1983; Wigfield, 1984) , the girls should be less likely than the boys to take optional advanced-level math courses. This potential problem could be further exacerbated by the fact that girls report liking social activities so much more than math; social activities also could interfere with continued participation in mathematics. In addition, within each gender the ordering of the boys' and girls' perceived interest match the gender-role stereotyping of the domains; boys like sports more than social activities and math more than English, whereas girls like social activities more than sports. The one exception to this pattern is girls and math: Girls and boys report liking math equally well, and girls like math slightly more than they like English. Does this finding go against the prediction that early adolescents will like gender-roleappropriate activities better than gender-role-inappropriate activities? Not if girls in this sample view math as just as appropriate for females as for males. Jacobs (1987) found that girls in this sample do stereotype sports as a male domain, social as a female domain, and math as gender neutral. Earlier work (Stein & Smithells, 1969) also found that girls at this age do not view math as a male activity. Finally, as in Study 1, the gender differences in competence beliefs and subjective values did not increase over the four waves of the study. However, based on previous studies (Eccles et al., 1983; Stein & Smithells, 1969; Wigfield, 1984 ) , it seems likely that the gender differences will increase later in adolescence.",

Two main explanations have been given, particularly for the changes in beliefs about the academic activities (see Stipek & Mac Iver, 1989; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992) . One explanation involves organismic factors such as how children's processing of evaluative feedback changes over time. Younger children appear to be overly optimistic in their competence beliefs and older children more realistic. For instance, Nicholls (1979) reported that 6-yearolds' beliefs about their reading ability did not correlate with their actual reading achievement, whereas by 12 years of age, the correlations between children's competence beliefs and reading performance were .70 (see also Stipek, 1984) . It is likely that older children's competence beliefs are more realistic because they have had more experience with evaluative feedback from different achievement tasks, because they can integrate information better over time, and because they are better able to use social comparison information to obtain a more accurate sense of their relative standing (see Parsons & Ruble, 1977; Ruble, 1983) . Moreover, as children get older, many of them begin to view ability as a rather stable entity that cannot be changed much (see Dweck & Elliott, 1983; Nicholls, 1984 Nicholls, , 1990 ). However, it does not appear that all young children are overly optimistic; in Study 1 the standard deviations are quite similar for younger and older children in the different cohorts, suggesting that there is a similar dispersion of scores for these different age groups. This finding suggests that even some young children have less positive competence beliefs in the different domains. As mentioned earlier, Heyman et al. (1992) also have found that some very young children appear to already be developing negative achievementrelated beliefs and behaviors.",

Eccles and Midgley (1989) and Eccles, Wigfield, Midgley, et al. (1993) have discussed how aspects of traditional middle school classroom and school environments can deflate children's competence beliefs for different academic tasks. Traditional middle grades schools are typically larger, less personal, and more formal than elementary schools. Middle grades teachers are often subject matter specialists, and they usually instruct many more students than do elementary teachers in self-contained classrooms. Thus they are less likely to come to know students well, to feel that students are trustworthy, and to grant them autonomy (see Brophy & Evertson, 1978; , for more detailed discussion of these changes). Indeed, middle grades teachers may feel that it is difficult to affect the achievement of many of their students, especially because they see them for a relatively small proportion of the school day (Midgley, Feldlaufer, & Eccles, 1989) .",

The shift to traditional middle grades school often involves an increase in practices such as whole class task organization (Rounds & Osaki, 1982) and public evaluation of the correctness of work (Harter et al., 1992) , each of which may encourage the use of social comparison and ability self-assessment. Between-classroom ability grouping practices also increase (Oakes, 1981 (Oakes, , 1985 . Once students have been assigned to classrooms on the basis of their ability, mobility to another ability level is infrequent (Oakes, 1981 (Oakes, , 1985 . Also, teachers often believe they have to be more serious about instruction and performance evaluation (Blyth, Simmons, & Bush, 1978; Kavrell & Petersen, 1984; Schulenberg, Asp, & Petersen, 1984 ) .

Simmons and Blyth (1987) argued that adolescents need a safe as well as an intellectually challenging environment to meet these developmental tasks. Many of the practices in traditional middle grades schools provide neither of these things. These practices can result in a deterioration in academic motivation and performance for these early adolescents. More specifically, the environmental changes often associated with transition to traditional middle grades schools emphasize competition, social comparison, and ability self-assessment at a time of early adolescents' heightened self-focus. These changes decrease decision making and choice at a time when early adolescents desire more autonomy. They disrupt social networks and decrease the opportunity for close adult-child relationships to develop at a time when adolescents are especially concerned with peer relationships and may be in special need of close adult relationships outside of the home. Furthermore, the fact that most traditional middle grades schools are larger and less personal and that teachers must interact with so many more students make it more likely that some early adolescents' emerging problems will go unnoticed.",

As children understand their performance outcomes more clearly and as school environments change in ways that make school more competitive, evaluative, and controlling, many children's beliefs about the usefulness and importance of different academic activities will decrease, as will their interest (see Wigfield, in press; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992 , for more detailed discussion). This change may be particularly likely if their competence beliefs decrease as well. For instance, as children's competence beliefs in math or reading decrease, they also may begin to view these activities as less useful and important. By doing so they can maintain a higher level of self-esteem (see Harter, 1985 Harter, , 1990 .",

Later in elementary school and into middle grades school, the contextual factors may become more important. Once students can understand the evaluative feedback in relatively sophisticated ways, the methods by which that information is presented and the relative emphasis given to different aspects of performance probably become the most important factors determining change in children's achievement-related beliefs and values.",

These negative shifts may show the beginnings of the psychological processes that put some early adolescents at risk for later school failure.

In previous work with older adolescents (e.g., Eccles, 1984; Eccles et al., 1983; Eccles, Adler, & Meece, 1984; Meece, Wigfield, & Eccles, 1990) , adolescents' competence beliefs and expectancies for success are the strongest predictors of subsequent performance in math, stronger predictors in fact than previous math performance. Adolescents' valuing of math is the strongest predictor of their intentions to take more math and actual decisions about whether or not to continue enrolling in math class. Similar work should be done with the early adolescent and elementary school-aged children in Studies 1 and 2 to see how these relations unfold in different domains (see Wigfield, in press, for further discussion).",

Similar differences in the Study 1 sample should be explored, along with other individual difference factors. Such analyses will provide a better understanding of different developmental trajectories in these important self-belief constructs.",

We certainly hope so.",
