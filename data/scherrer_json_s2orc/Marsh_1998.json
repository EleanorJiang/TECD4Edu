We expanded this application in a multicohort-multioccasion (MCMO) study that provides simultaneous multicohort comparisons (crosssectional comparisons of different age cohorts) and longitudinal comparisons of the same children on multiple occasions. There was reasonable support for predictions that reliability, stability, factor structure, and the distinctiveness of the SDQ factors would improve with age (a between-group age cohort comparison) and from 1 year to the next (a longitudinal comparison), and that small gender differences were reasonably stable over age. Consistent with the proposal that children's self-perceptions become more realistic with age, Time 1 (Tl) teacher ratings were more highly correlated with student self-ratings at T2 than T1 and contributed to the prediction of T2 self-concept beyond effects mediated by T1 self-concepts. The results support and expand the surprisingly good support for the multidimensionality of self-concept responses for very young children using this procedure.",

A major focus of this research has been to clarify the emergence and progressive differentiation of more specific facets of selfconcept in the early childhood years. Innovative approaches in developing measures and procedures for their administration to young children below the age of 8 years (Byrne, 1996; Harter & Pike, 1984; have contributed to changing perspectives on the emergence of a more differentiated structure of self-concept.",

                "text": "Predictions about how self-concept and its factorial structure evolve with age have been proposed from a variety of theoretical perspectives. Shavelson, Hubner, and Stanton (1976) hypothesized that selfconcept becomes more differentiated with age. Marsh (1985 Marsh ( ,1990 Marsh, Barnes, Cairns, & Tidman, 1984) , expanding on the Shavelson et al. hypothesis, proposed that self-concepts of very young children are consistently high but that with increasing life experience children learn their relative strengths and weaknesses so that with increasing levels of age, mean levels of self-concept decline, individual selfconcept becomes more differentiated, and self-concept becomes more highly correlated with external indicators of competence (e.g., skills, accomplishments, and self-concepts inferred by significant others). Markus and Wurf (1987) noted that the structure of self depends on both the information available to an individual and the cognitive ability to process this information. Reflecting changes in the cognitive ability to process self-relevant information, Harter (1983 Harter ( , 1985 proposed that self-concept becomes increasingly abstract with age, shifting from concrete descriptions of behavior in early childhood, to trait-like psychological constructs (e.g., popular, smart, good looking) in middle childhood, to more abstract constructs during adolescence. According to her conceptual model, the concept of a global self-worth did not evolve before the age of about 8. Eccles et al. (1993;  also see Wigfield & Eccles, 1992) developed an expectancy-value model of academic choice in which selfperceptions of competency and task value ratings in different domains form the basis of subsequent academic choice and have recently examined the domain specificity of responses by very young children. Based on earlier research (e.g., Nicholls, 1979; Parsons & Ruble, 1977; Stipek & MacIver, 1989) , Eccles et al. proposed that the declines in mean levels of competency self-ratings reflected an optimistic bias for very young children and increased accuracy in responses by young children as they grow older.",

These advances have not, however, been fully applied to research with young children in part because psychometrically strong, multidimensional instruments have not been developed for young children (see Harter, 1983; Marsh & Craven, 1997; Stipek & MacIver, 1989; Wylie, 1989) . As proposed by Harter (1983 Harter ( , 1985 Harter & Pike, 1984) , the effective measurement of self-concept with very young children may require simplified item contents or pictorial representations, simplified response formats, and individually based interviews instead of conventional paper-and-pencil tests that are group administered. Perhaps, as appears to have been the case for research with older children, progress in theory, research, and practice for very young children will be stimulated by the development of better multidimensional measurement instruments.",

                "text": "Measurement of Young Children's Self-concepts Harter and Pike (1984) developed an instrument to measure self-concept scales (physical, cognitive, peers, and maternal) using items represented by parallel verbal statements and pictures. They found that below age 8 children either did not understand general self-worth items or did not provide reliable responses, prompting them to exclude this scale from their instrument. Their exploratory factor analyses supported only two scales: competence (incorporating the physical and cognitive scales) and social acceptance (incorporating the peer and maternal scales). The authors noted that the factor structure was less differentiated than typically found for older children and that there was no differentiation among competencies in specific areas, thus supporting the frequently noted assumption that the structure becomes more differentiated with age. Their failure to support their a priori four-factor structure, however, provides a weak basis of inference about the structure of self-concept, particularly when they did not use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) that allows the researcher to specify the model to be tested (e.g., . suggested that the failure to separate even the physical and academic components that are so robust in responses by slightly older students was surprising. They noted, for example, that correlations among the physical and academic scales reported by Harter and Pike (YS of .43-.56) did not approach 1.0 even after correction for unreliability and that there was support for their differentiation in relation to other criteria reported by Harter and Pike (e.g., teacher ratings, choice behavior, being held back a grade). Finally, even support for their conclusion that self-concept becomes more differentiated with age was not strong in that Harter and Pike neither reported administering their instrument to older children nor offered any evidence that self-concept became more differentiated within the 4-7 age range that they considered. In summary, the Harter and Pike interpretation of their results may be unduly pessimistic about the ability of very young children to differentiate among multiple dimensions of self-concept, and it may be premature to conclude that children at this age level can identify only two broad components of self. described a new, adaptive procedure for assessing multiple dimensions of self-concept for kindergarten, first-and second-year students aged 5-8. They explored pictorial self-concept instruments like that developed by Harter and Pike (1984) but found that the juxtaposition of the pictures and verbal explanations seemed more confusing to young students than the verbal presentations alone. The critical component of their study was the individualized interview format used to collect SDQ-I responses. There was an initial concern that the 64-item SDQ-I instrument would be too long for these very young children, but items near the end were more effective than earlier items. Apparently children learned to respond appropriately so that they were responding more appropriately to items at the end of the instrument than to items at the beginning of the instrument. This observation has important implications for the typically short instruments used with young children. Based on CFAs, Marsh et al. found support for all eight SDQ-I scales, including the Esteem scale at each year level. However, with increasing age the SDQ-I factors became more differentiated as inferred from the decreasing size of factor correlations. They also reported gender differences for this very young group of children that were largely consistent with extrapolations from earlier research with older children.",

                "text": "Based on an expectancy-value model, Eccles and her colleagues (Eccles, Adler, & Meece, 1984; Eccles et al., 1993; Wigfield et al., 1997) focused on how expectancy (self-perceptions of competency, expectations of future success, and self-efficacy) combine with task value to influence academic choice. Their competency-related beliefs in specific activities (how good they are, how good they are relative to others, how good they are relative to other activities, expectations of future success, ability to master new skills) were closely related to the self-concept construct. Eccles et al. (1993) provided further support for the multidimensionality of self-concept for young children, finding that children in grades l, 2, and 4 differentiated math, reading, music, and sports selfconcepts (self-perceived competency ratings). In exploratory factor analyses of responses to items from all four domains and both the competency and task value components, four domain-specific factors were clearly evident for each age group. The CFAs of competency and task value ratings conducted separately for each domain provided supported the separation of task and competency ratings, although no CFAs of competency ratings from different domains were reported. Consistent with research with older children (e.g., Eccles & Wigfield, 1995) , there was no evidence that children distinguished between different competency-related beliefs (e.g., self-perceived skills and expectations for future success). Wigfield et al. (1997) , using a cohort-sequential longitudinal design (see Baltes & Nesselroade, 1979) , assessed three age cohorts (students in grades 1, 2, and 4) in each of three successive years. This allowed them to compare age differences due to cohort differences with true longitudinal comparisons and to evaluate stability over time for responses by the same children. Consistent with previous research (e.g., Marsh, 1989) they found that perceived competency declined with age, and these effects were reasonably consistent over domain and across cohort and longitudinal comparisons. There was also a consistent pattern in test-retest stability coefficients in which stability over time was low for the youngest children and grew steadily with age, although these comparisons were complicated to some extent by age-related differences in reliability. Wigfield et al. reported predicted gender differences (favoring boys in math and sport, favoring girls in music and reading), but found few interactions with gender and either cohort or time of measurement. Instead, consistent with Marsh (1989) and , they found that gender differences emerged early and were reasonably consistent over age. Finally, teacher and parent ratings of competence collected at each time of measurement showed little systematic relation to self-ratings for the youngest children but were substantially related to self-perceptions for the oldest children. For example, only teacher ratings of sport were significantly related to self-perceptions in Years 1 and 2, whereas teacher ratings in all four domains were significantly related to self-perceptions in Years 5 and 6. Interestingly, in contrast to children's self-perceptions, teacher and parent ratings of competence did not vary as a function of age. Wigfield et al. concluded that very young children have more optimistic selfperceptions of their own competence whereas older children have more realistic self-perceptions.",

Both reviewers noted a large number of different instruments available for very young children but concluded that only two were sufficiently developed to warrant consideration; the Harter and Pike (1984) instrument discussed earlier and the Joseph (1979) instrument that relies on items from a variety of different domains to infer a global, undifferentiated self-concept and so is of limited relevance to our concern about the multidimensional structure of self-concept. Both reviewers noted that there was a paucity of psychometric evidence (reliability, stability, factor structure) for either of these instruments and the evidence that was available was not particularly encouraging. Essentially no further development of either instrument was reported by Byrne beyond that described 7 years earlier by Wylie (1989) . Although Byrne (1996) did not consider the study in her chapter on measures for very young children, she did review the SDQ-I in another chapter devoted to measures for somewhat older, preadolescent children, concluding that (Byrne, 1996, p. 117 ) \"there is absolutely no doubt that the SJIQ-I is clearly the most validated selfconcept instrument available for use with preadolescent children.\" Byrne specifically noted the effectiveness of the study in adapting the SDQ-I for use with very young children, emphasizing that the psychometric properties based on this single study were stronger than those based on any of the instruments specifically designed for very young children.",

In his subsequent review and empirical analyses 12,000 responses from the SDQ normative archives, Marsh (1989) reported that there was a reasonably consistent pattern of self-concepts declining from a young age through early adolescence, leveling out, and then increasing at least through early adulthood. These age differences were, however, small and differed somewhat depending on the particular scale. For example, Marsh et al. (1984) reported that the initially very high parents self-concept ratings remained high across the early preadolescent period but fell sharply during the adolescent period. More recently, Chapman and Tunmer (1995) also reported that reading self-concept declined with age based on a cross-sectional study of very young children as did the and Wigfield et al. (1997) studies described earlier. Marsh and Craven (1997) argued that whereas young children have extremely high selfconcepts, they develop more realistic appraisals of their relative strengths and weaknesses with age and this added experience is apparently incorporated into their self-concepts. Hence, with increasing life experience, self-concept in specific domains should become more differentiated, more accurately reflecting the child's relative strengths and weaknesses.",

(1976) proposed age and de-velopmental differences in the structure of self-concept. They hypothesized that self-concept becomes more differentiated with age but offered no clear rationale for evaluating this hypothesis. Marsh (1989; operationalized this hypothesis to mean that correlations among SDQ scales become smaller with age and tested this hypothesis with responses to the three SDQ instruments. For responses by very young children, correlations decreased in size from kindergarten to Year 1, and from Year 1 to Year 2. For preadolescent responses, correlations decreased from Year 2 to Year 3, and to lesser extents between Years 3 and 4, and between Years 4 and 5. For responses by older preadolescents, adolescents, and late adolescents, no further declines in the correlations were found. Thus, these data support the Shavelson et al. hypothesis that self-concept becomes differentiated with age for very young children, but not for responses by older children. Perhaps differentiation in self-concept reaches some optimal point at which social comparison processes and cognitive abilities are adequately developed rather than after a cumulative period of life experiences. However, as in most studies of self-concept development, researchers relied on cross-sectional age comparisons rather than stronger tests of differences over time for the same cohort or more sophisticated designs that allow simultaneous cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons.",

Marsh (1989) also found that age X gender interactions were typically small, except for Appearance (very young girls had higher Appearance self-concepts than boys, but older girls had much lower Appearance self-concepts). Apparently, gender stereotypes have already affected selfconcepts by preadolescence, and these effects are relatively stable from preadolescence to at least early adulthood. Subsequent research with even younger children (Eccles et al., 1993; further supports the suggestion that gender stereotypes affect self-concepts of children at very young ages. In a recent review of gender differences in self-concept, Crain (1996, p. 412) also concluded that there are \"differences in domain-specific self-concepts of boys and girls that tend to run along gender-stereotypic lines.\" However, she argued that the gender differences were typically not of sufficient size to be of substantive significance and that societal changes in the role of women may alter the pattern of gender differences in multiple dimensions of self-concept.",

                "text": "In eight MTMM studies, Marsh (1988 Marsh ( , 1990 demonstrated significant agreement between multiple self-concepts inferred by primary school teachers and student responses to the SDQ-I. The mean correlation between student and teacher ratings across all scales was r = .30, but agreement was strongest where the teachers could most readily make relevant observations (math, .37; reading, .37; school, .33; physical ability, .38; and, perhaps, peer relations .29) . Studentteacher agreement was lower on Relations with Parents (.17) and Physical Appearance (.16). extended this research in a comparison of the abilities of elementary school teachers, mothers, and fathers to infer multiple self-concepts of preadolescent children. Responses by mothers and by fathers were slightly more accurate than those by teachers, but all three groups were more accurate in their inferences about Physical Ability, Reading, Mathematics, and School self-concepts than other specific scales or Esteem. Self-other agreement in this study tended to be better than has been found in other research, but this apparently reflects the fact that children and significant others all completed the complete SDQ-I instrument (in contrast to studies described earlier in which teachers infer self-concepts of all students in their class using a single-item summary rating of each SDQ-I scale whereas students complete multi-item scales). Nevertheless, the selfother agreement reported by Marsh and Craven was still much less than values reported in studies with older participants. For example, in MTMM studies of university students and \"person in the world who knew them best\" (Marsh, Barnes, & Hocevar, 1985; Marsh & Byrne, 1993) , self-other agreement was very high (mean r = .57), and four of the scales had selfother correlations over .75. The authors speculated that self-other agreement was so good because (1) the participants were older and thus knew themselves better and based their self-responses on more objective, observable criteria; (2) both participants and significant others made their responses on the same well-developed instrument based on multi-item scales; and (3) the significant others in these studies knew the participants better than the observers in most research. These results imply that external observers are best able to infer self-concepts when respondents are older and the multidimensionality of self-concept is taken into account.",

                "text": "The juxtaposition of the self-other agreement studies for different age groups also provides at least indirect support for the proposal that with increasing age and life experience children learn their relative strengths and weaknesses so that their self-concepts became more differentiated and more highly correlated with external indicators, including self-concepts inferred by significant others (also see Wigfield et al., 1997) . A fuller evaluation of this proposal, however, requires CFA models based on longitudinal data for very young children. For example, particularly strong support for this proposal would be the demonstration that ratings by an external observer at T1 contribute directly to the prediction of self-concept ratings of the child at T2 beyond what can be predicted by the child's self-concept ratings at T1. In this sense, ratings by the external observer are able to predict changes in the child's self-concept over time because the child's self-concept is likely to change in the direction of being more consistent with external criteria used by the observer at T1 (i.e., becoming more \"realistic\"). provided a promising advance in the measurement of very young children's selfconcepts and in clarifying the emergence and progressive differentiation of specific facets of self-concept for this age group. Due in part to limitations in self-concept research with very young children, reviewers (e.g., Byrne, 1996; Crain, 1996) noted the important contributions of this study but also emphasized the need to follow up this research with longitudinal studies more appropriate for evaluating the development of self-concept. In response to such concerns, the present investigation is based on the Marsh et al. (1991) study but expands on the empirical and theoretical implications of that earlier research in a number of ways. In particular, the earlier study was based on a single wave of data from three age cohorts so that developmental implications relied primarily on cross-sectional comparisons. Here we used a multicohort-multioccasion (MCMO) design with two waves of data collected 1 year apart with the same children in each of three age cohorts. Based on these data, we contrasted cross-sectional (multiple age cohort) comparisons with true longitudinal (multiple occasion) comparisons. T h s provides a much stronger basis for evaluating age-related differences in reliability, dimensionality, and gender differences that were the focus of the earlier research, and for evaluating stability over time. In addition, self-concept ratings inferred by teachers are included in the present investigation. This additional source of information allows the evaluation of the accuracy of teacher's inferred self-concept ratings, an examination of how relations between inferred and actual ratings vary with age cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and an evaluation of the proposal that young children's self-concept becomes more predictable with age. More specifically, in addition to building on the earlier research by providing further psychometric support for the use of the individually administered SDQ-I with young children, the present investigation is designed to (1) test the Shavelson et al. (1976) hypothesis that self-concept becomes more differentiated with age and to provide more specific data on how the factor structure of self-concept varies over time for children aged 5-8, (2) evaluate the stability of young children's self-concepts over time, (3) evaluate gender and age differences for young children longitudinally as well as cross-sectionally, and (4) evaluate how teacher ratings of the self-concepts of their students relate to students' own self-concept ratings and how these relations vary with age. From a practical perspective the ability to measure the selfconcepts of young children and elucidate developments in self-concept over time enables early childhood practitioners to understand young children better, to identify an accurate basis for assessment, and to provide an outcome measure for a variety of interventions. Hence this research has the potential to advance self-concept theory, research, and practice.",

The interviewers were 110 university students in a primary teacher education program who already had experience working with young children. All interviewers were given a 2-hour training program and subsequently tested children from each of the three age groups as part of a class assignment. At each participating school a group of interviewers simultaneously conducted interviews with all students from a particular class. The testing was conducted using an individual, one-on-one interview style format. Each testing session began with a brief set of instructions assuring participants of the confidentiality of their responses and presenting four example items. After reading each example item the interviewer asked the child if he or she understood the sentence. If the child did not understand the sentence, the interviewer explained the sentence further, paraphrasing any words the child did not understand, ascertained that the child understood the sentence, re-read the sentence, and requested a response. The interviewer initially asked the child to respond \"yes\" or \"no\" to the sentence to indicate whether the sentence was true or false as a description of the child. If the child initially responded \"yes,\" the interviewer then asked the child if he or she meant \"yes always\" or \"yes sometimes.\" If the child initially responded \"no,\" the interviewer then asked the child if he or she meant \"no always\" or \"no sometimes.\" The second response probe was stated for every response even when it was answered in the initial response (e.g., the child said \"yes always\" instead of \"yes\"), thus providing a check on the accuracy of the child's initial response. After the child successfully responded to example items and any questions were answered, the interviewers then read aloud each of the 64 positively worded SDQ-I items. The child was encouraged to seek clarification of any item they did not understand. If the child stated that the item was not understood, the interviewer explained the meaning of the item further and ascertained that the child understood the sentence before readministering the item. If the child indicated that he or she understood the sentence but could not decide whether to respond yes or no, the interviewer recorded a response of 3, halfway between the responses of \"no sometimes\" and \"yes sometimes.\" Because this occurred infrequently and children were not told of this option, this middle category was used very infrequently. Halfway through the administration of the SDQ-I items the interviewer asked the child to do some physical activities for a brief period before proceeding to administer the remaining 32 items. This procedure was intended to cater to young children with short attention spans.",

Analysis of 32 item pairs instead of 64 individual items is advantageous because this strategy substantially reduces the number of measured variables and because the responses to item pairs tend to be more reliable, to be more normally distributed, and to have less idiosyncratic variance than do individual items. The CFAs were conducted with the SPSS version of LISREL 7 (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1989) using maximum likelihood estimates derived from covariance matrices based on pairwise deletion for missing data. A detailed description of CFA is beyond the scope of the present investigation and is available elsewhere (e.g., Bollen, 1989; Byrne, 1989; Joreskog & Sorbom, 1989; Pedhazur & Schmelkin, 1991) . Following Marsh, Balla, and Hau (1996) and McDonald and Marsh (1990) , we emphasize the relative noncentrality index (RNI) to evaluate goodness of fit but also present the chi-square test statistic and df that allow the calculation of other indexes of fit. Whereas there are no precise standards for what values of indices such as these are needed for an \"acceptable\" fit, typical guidelines are that the RNI should be greater than .9. However, model comparison is also facilitated by positing a partially nested ordering of models in which the parameter estimates for a more restrictive model are a proper subset of those in a more general model (for further discussion, see Bentler, 1990) . In the present application, for example, a model in which factor loadings are constrained to be invariant across the three age cohorts is nested under a model in which there are no such invariance constraints of the factor loadings. The fit indices for alternative models, however, can be compared whether or not the particular models are nested. Whereas tests of statistical significance and indices of fit aid in the evaluation of the fit of a model, there is ultimately a degree of subjectivity and professional judgment in the selection of a \"best\" model.",

In each case, single-indicator latent variables were assumed to be measured without error. Whereas this strategy is reasonable for gender, there is likely to be error in the teacher ratings.

However, when the same items are administered to the same participants on multiple occasions, it is likely that the uniquenesses associated with the matching measured variables are correlated. If there are substantial correlated uniquenesses that are not included in the model, then the estimated correlations between the corresponding latent constructs will be positively biased. In the present application, for example, this would result in a positively biased estimate of the test-retest stability coefficient relating responses to the same latent variable on two occasions. This situation is not specific to CFA studies, and Marsh (199313) demonstrated that stability coefficients can exceed 1 .O when disattenuated for measurement error. However, the inclusion of correlated uniquenesses in CFAs provides a test for these correlated uniquenesses and a control for what would otherwise be a positive bias. Because of this problem, test-retest stability correlations are likely to be negatively biased because they do not take into account measurement error and, perhaps, positively biased because they do not control for correlated uniquenesses. This complexity is likely to be compounded when, as in the present investigation, comparisons are made between different age cohorts where the size of measurement errors and, perhaps, the correlated uniquenesses are likely to vary with age. Because of these complications, a potentially im-portant contribution of the present investigation is to evaluate age cohort differences in test-retest stability coefficients with latent variable models that incorporate appropriate control for measurement error and test for correlated uniquenesses.",

Across all 32 sets of analyses (eight SDQ-I scales for total, kindergarten, Year 1, and Year 2), the difference between the two stability correlation estimates never exceeded .06 and typically was much smaller, suggesting that the inclusion of correlated uniquenesses in this study was not a critical issue.

Overall, these results provide strong support for the discriminant validity of the self-concept responses but also support the prediction that discriminant validity increases with age. Marsh (1989) proposed an alternative approach to evaluating how the distinctiveness of the self-concept traits vary with age. He argued that some of the scales (e.g., Reading and School) should be substantially correlated whereas others (e.g., Physical and Reading) should not. Based on previous research and theory, he selected seven correlations that he predicted to be the lowest. Based on the assumption that self-concept becomes more differentiated with age, he reasoned that the difference in the mean of the selected correlations and mean of all correlations should increase with age. Here we extended this logic to evaluations of longitudinal differences in correlations for the same age cohort on different occasions as well as cross-sectional differences between age cohorts like those considered by Marsh (1989) . At T1, the mean of the selected YS compared to the mean of all YS (see Table 1 ) did not differ for kindergarten students, was slightly lower for Year 1 students, and was clearly lower for Year 2 students. Although both the means of all YS and selected YS tended to decrease over time, the decrease was larger for the mean of YS selected a priori to be lower. For each age cohort, the difference between the mean of the selected YS and the mean of all YS was larger at T2 than T1. Hence, these comparisons based on the cross-sectional and particularly the longitudinal comparisons supported the hypothesis that self-concept becomes more differentiated with age.",

They found, however, that factor loadings tended to be larger for items near the end of the SDQ than those near the start. They interpreted this to mean that there was a warmup effect, whereby young children learned to respond appropriately, rather than a fatigue effect. There was support for this conclusion based on both T1 and T2 factor solutions ( Table 3) . The factor loadings were larger for the last measured variable than the first measured variable for all eight factors in the T1 solution and for seven of eight factors in the T2 solution. For both T1 and T2 solutions the median factor loadings increased steadily for indicators 1 (.58 and .66 for T1 and T2, respectively), 2 (.66 and .70), 3 (.70 and .72), and 4 (.74 and .74). These results suggest a substantial warmup effect that was particularly evident at T1 but that was still evident at T2. Whereas the factor loadings were systematically larger for the T2 solution, the difference was primarily due to the higher loadings for measured variables from the first half of the SDQI. Table 4 are a series of four models fit separately for each SDQ scale. Separate one-factor congeneric factor models were used to assess the unidimensionality of responses for each scale at T1 and T2, respectively (those labeled T1 and T2). For the total sample, these one-factor models provided a very good fit for T1 and T2 responses (RNIs vary from .96 to 1.0). The RNIs were also high for analyses of each age cohort considered separately, with the possible exception of kindergarten responses to the Physical and Appearance scales (RNIs of .86 and .84, respectively).",

These stability coefficients in Table 4 are all substantially larger than those based on scale scores considered earlier (Table 1) . This follows because the correlations in Table 4 were corrected for measurement error (and the inclusion of correlated uniquenesses had only a small effect).

Consistent with this observation, teacher ratings contributed to the prediction of T2 self-concept ratings beyond the contribution of T1 self-concept ratings for six of eight SDQ scales-all but Appearance and Reading. For Reading self-concept, teacher inferences were more accurate than any other scales at T1 and all of the relation between teacher ratings and T2 Reading self-concept was mediated by T1 self-concept. Teacher inferences of Appearance self-concept were not significantly related to either T1 or T2 selfconcept ratings by students. Particularly because T1 teacher ratings and T1 self-concept ratings by students were collected at the same time (near the end of the school year), it is particularly noteworthy that teacher ratings were more highly correlated with T2 student ratings collected a year later when students had a new teacher. These results provided clear support for the hypothesis that student self-concept ratings grew more predictable with time-that they were less likely to make idiosyncratic self-ratings and were more likely to base their self-concept ratings on criteria like those used by external observers.",

The critical comparisons involved cross-sectional comparisons based on the multiple age cohorts, longitudinal comparisons based on responses by the same cohort on the multiple occasions (T1 and T2), and age cohort X occasion interactions that tested the consistency of longitudinal comparisons over the different age cohorts. This MCMO design was operationalized as a 3 (age cohort) X 2 (gender) X 2 (time) design in which time was a within-subjects (repeated-measures) effect whereas age cohort and gender were behveen-subjects effects (see Table 7 ). The main effects of age cohort and time provided alternative (cross-sectional and longitudinal) tests of the effect of age. If there were no effect of age, then the main effects of age cohort, time, and their interaction should all be nonsignificant. If the effect of age was linear, then the effects of both age and time should both be significant, but the age cohort X time interaction should be nonsignificant. However, if the effect of age was nonlinear, then there may be main and interaction effects that would require a careful evaluation of the means for each cohort / time combination. In the present investigation the comparison of the cohort and time effects was facilitated because each age cohort differed from the next cohort by 1 year and the time interval in the longitudinal comparisons was also 1 year. The construct validity of interpretations of age differences would be strengthened if these tests provided consistent results. The main effect of gender provided a test of gender differences averaged across age cohorts and time. However, the gender X age cohort interaction and the gender X time interaction each provided alternative tests of the consistency of the gender effects over age.",

Ultimately, however, mean differences based on cross-sectional comparisons and longitudinal comparisons are both legitimate approaches to evaluating age differences. Because there are potential strengths and weaknesses in both strategies, the best solution is to combine both types of comparison in the MCMO design. However, particularly when sample sizes are modest, an overreliance on simplistic tests of statistical significance can be counterproductive. Thus, for example, a marginally significant (longitudinal) time effect and a marginally nonsignificant (cross-sectional) age cohort effect may actually reflect the underlying age difference in a very consistent manner. For this reason, it is critical to evaluate the consistency in the pattern, direction, and size of age differences inferred from longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons, particularly when only one of the comparisons is significant or there is an age cohort X time interaction.",

Marsh (1990) proposed that selfconcepts of very young children are consistently high but that with increasing life experience children learn their relative strengths and weaknesses so that with increasing levels of age, mean levels of selfconcept decline, individual self-concepts become more differentiated, and self-concept becomes more highly correlated with external indicators of competence (e.g., skills, accomplishments, and selfconcepts inferred by significant others). Similarly, Eccles et al. (1993) proposed that the declines in mean levels of competency self-ratings reflected an optimistic bias for very young children and increased accuracy in responses by young children as they grow older and become more realistic. A number of the empirical trends evaluated here provide new and continuing support for these theoretical predictions-support for the factor structure of multidimensional self-concept responses and the increasing distinctiveness of the different self-concept components, longitudinal and cross-sectional age comparisons, accuracy of teacher inferred self-concept ratings.",

The T2 results were, perhaps, stronger than the T1 results in that the factor loadings tended to be larger, the factors tended to be more distinct, the factors tended to be more reliable, and relations with T1 teacher ratings tended to be larger. Because the children were 1 year older at T2 than T1, the stronger results at T2 were not unexpected.

The size of correlations between self-concept factors decreased across cross-sectional age cohorts and decreased over time for longitudinal comparisons. This pattern of results was evident in comparisons based on raw scale scores and comparisons based on latent factor correlations in the CFAs. However, Marsh (1989) proposed that correlations between some components of self-concept should be substantial whereas others should be small. Support for the increasing distinctiveness of SDQ factors based on correlations selected a priori to be small was particularly strong. The average size of these selected correlations did not differ from the average size of all correlations for the youngest children at T1, but the differences steadily increased over age cohorts and over time within each age cohort. In an alternative operationalization of distinctiveness, the S D of the eight self-concept scale scores was computed for each child at T1 and T2. These SDs showed a clear pattern of increasing distinctiveness (higher SDs) over age cohorts and over time within age cohorts. The consistent pattern of results for the various comparisons of age differences in the size of correlations and the size of SDs supported the conclusion that self-concepts became more distinct with age for the age range considered here. Finally, based on the MTMM studies in which multiple occasions were taken to be the multiple methods, support for the discriminant validity of the SDQ-I factors improved with age. We interpreted these various results to mean that young children were better able to distinguish between their relative strengths and weaknesses due to gaining life experience that comes with age, and that this was reflected in their self-concept responses.",

The present investigation offered a potentially important contribution due to the MCMO design coupled with the good psychometric properties for responses by very young children. For four of eight individual scales (Physical, Peers, Math, Esteem) there were no age differences for either cross-sectional or longitudinal comparisons. The strongest and most consistent effect was for Appearance self-concept in that both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons indicated that selfconcept declined with age. Similarly, both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons showed that School self-concept declined with age. Reading selfconcept showed an initial increase followed by a decline that was also consistent across cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. Parents self-concept was particularly interesting in that it showed a significant increase in self-concept with age, although the nature of the trend differed somewhat for T1 and T2 responses (see Table 7 ). These results were not fully consistent with expectations that self-concept will decline during these early years based on responses by somewhat older children (Marsh, 1989) . In particular, the increase in Parents self-concept ran counter to expectations, although Marsh et al. (1984; Marsh, 1989) found that there was no significant decline in Parent self-concept responses during early adolescence even though responses to this scale were highest of all SDQ scales. Even though these differences in Parent responses were significant, the sizes of the differences were very small (Table 1) . For other scales, there is a general tendency for decreasing selfconcepts with age cohort and time, but these differences were smaller than expected.",

Teacher ratings collected at T1 were significantly related to students' ratings at T1 and T2. Logically-particularly given that the ratings were collected near the end of the school year-it might be expected that the T1 teacher ratings should be more highly correlated with T1 student ratings than T2 student ratings, and the effects of T1 teacher ratings on T2 self-concepts should be mediated by T1 self-concept ratings. This follows in that T1 teacher ratings and T1 self-concepts were collected at the same time (when the teacher had been the teacher of the student for almost a year), whereas at T2 each child typically had a new teacher who had taught the child for almost a year. However, T1 teacher ratings were more highly related to T2 self-concepts than to T1 self-concepts, and the direct effects of T1 teacher ratings were significant on T2 self-concept in addition to the effect mediated through T1 self-concepts.",

Instead, researchers have found a gender stereotypic pattern of gender differences that is surprisingly consistent over age. Because of the past difficulties in measuring self-concepts with very young children, the present investigation had the potential of making an important contribution in this area. The gender differences observed here were reasonably consistent across the different analyses and reasonably consistent with extrapolations from research based on older children. There were, however, some interesting differences based on these results and extrapolations from earlier research-the higher Appearance self-concepts for very young girls (compared to typical differences favoring boys for older students), the lack of gender differences favoring girls in School self-concept, the lack of gender differences favoring boys in Esteem, and perhaps the lack of gender differences favoring girls in Peer self-concept. Nevertheless, except for Physical self-concept, the gender differences and age X gender interactions observed here were modest, and this was consistent with previous research suggesting that gender differences are surprisingly stable over age. It was also interesting to note that the pattern of gender differences in student self-concept ratings was reasonably consistent with those based on teacher inferred self-concept ratings.",

Whereas we were initially concerned with a potential fatigue effect such that the quality of responses for items near the end of the instrument deteriorated, we actually found that these items were psychometrically stronger-not weaker. Across all items from the different scales, there was a clear progression of increasing factor loadings for items presented in first, second, third, and fourth quarters of the instrument. There was support for this effect at T1 and T2, although the effect was stronger at T1 when children were younger and had not previously completed the instrument. In fact, the larger T2 factor loadingscompared to T1 factor loadings-were largely due to the stronger performance of items in the first half of the instrument at T2. These results have important implications for early childhood researchers in that the use of short instruments may be counterproductive and may account for some of the difficulties researchers have in obtaining responses from very young children that yield good psychometric properties.",

A potential limitation of this strategy was that the wording of some of the items (e.g., those using the term \"mathematics\") was overly complex for some of these very young children. However, this potential limitation was apparently offset by the flexibility of the individual administration procedure in which the meaning of any item could be explained to a child who did not understand the item. Instruments specifically designed for very young children like those reviewed by Byrne (1996) and Wylie (1989) have typically not been used with older children. Hence it is not clear whether apparent problems with at least many of these instruments are inherent in the instruments instead of-or in addition to-their use with very young students. If an instrument is not effective with a population slightly older than the target population, it is unlikely to be effective with very young children.",
