                "text": "Over the past several decades, the U.S. economy has increasingly relied on math-, science-, and technology-related fields. Unfortunately, the number of youth, particularly women, pursuing college degrees and careers in math and science is declining (Panteli, Stack, & Ramsay, 2001) . Researchers have begun to document the pathways youth take to pursue particular careers. For example, high school math and science course choices are influential in youths' pursuit of a science-related career through their influence on youths' beliefs (Eccles, 1994; Farmer, Wardrop, Anderson, & Risinger, 1995; Farmer, Wardrop, & Rotella, 1999) . Given the growing importance of math and science in career choices, it is important that researchers understand what leads to various pathways in the pursuit of math and science careers. Although researchers know that high school math and science courses have long-term implications on youths' college and postcollege choices, little longitudinal work has focused on precursors of students' high school course choices. This information is necessary to expand researchers' understanding of what might influence course selection in high school. Theories of motivation, such as the Eccles expectancy-value model (Parsons [Eccles] , Adler, & Meece, 1984) , suggest that self-beliefs and task beliefs are critical precursors of these high school choices. These relations are reciprocal in that choices influence beliefs, which, in turn, impact subsequent choices (Eccles, 1994) . Thus, the purpose of this current investigation is to test the reciprocal relations between choices and beliefs in math and science to gain a better understanding of the process that might lead to choosing math and science coursework in high school.",

                "text": "Theoretically, the reciprocal relations between choices and beliefs should emerge across development as children move through middle childhood and into adolescence. Thus, choices made by elementary school children regarding math and science activities should influence their beliefs regarding both their abilities in and utility of these activities and then subsequently influence their later choices (or behaviors) regarding these academic subjects. These relations should emerge regardless of changes in the types of math and science choices across these periods. Elementary school children often do not have a choice in their math and science classes, because these choices are often predetermined by the school. Children at this age do, however, have some choice concerning their engagement in math and science activities outside of school. In high school, youths' participation in out-of-school math and science activities is low, as most youth spend their out-of-school time hanging out with friends, working, or engaging in extracurricular activities (Larson & Verma, 1999) . High school youth, however, exert choices in these domains in the courses they take during school. As a result, the types of choices youth make in math and science change as they age. According to the Eccles model (Parsons [Eccles] et al., 1984) , regardless of the changes in choices, early out-of-school choices should influence self-beliefs and task beliefs and subsequent adolescent school choices. Hence, this article will examine how engagement in out-of-school math and science enrichment activities relates to youths' subsequent self-beliefs and task beliefs, which, in turn, predict enrollment in high school math and science courses. Such longitudinal links between early engagement in enrichment activities and later course enrollment choices have implications for out-of-school programming, children's leisure pursuits, and strategies to get children on track for math and science careers.",

According to Erikson (1982) , middle childhood may be a particularly influential time for activities because this is when behavioral habits critical for health and competence are solidified and when skills, which form the basis for personal identities and self-esteem, are being learned. Furthermore, researchers have found that individual differences in self-beliefs and task beliefs emerge over the elementary school years and then are continually refined in response to performance feedback and identity formation processes through adolescence (Eccles, Lord, Roeser, Barber, & Jozefowicz, 1997; Jacobs, Finken, Griffin, & Wright, 1998; Wigfield et al., 1997) . Thus, participation in out-of-school activities during the elementary school years when self-beliefs and task beliefs are emerging may be particularly important.",

The actual number of math and science courses adolescents took in high school was predicted by youths' task values (e.g., interest, feelings of the importance) but not their math self-concepts (Joyce & Farenga, 2000 ; Parsons [Eccles] et al., 1984; Updegraff, Eccles, Barber, & O'Brien, 1996) .

We believe that after-school activity choices, psychological predictors, and adolescent choices influence each other through various feedback systems over time (Eccles, 1994) . Initially, daily experiences during activity participation in middle childhood (Erikson, 1982) are likely to influence the development of children's task and selfperceptions, which, in turn, should predict subsequent choices in adolescence. Very limited research has addressed such developmental questions. The research that does exist is cross-sectional and suggests that participating in out-of-school science activities is associated with youths' interest in science and aspirations of a physical science career (Jacobs et al., 1998) . We hypothesize that youths' participation in out-of-school activities will be positively associated with their self-beliefs and task beliefs in these domains. In turn, we expect that these beliefs will positively predict later choices; in this case, the number of high school courses.",

In addition, youth who perform well in math and science are more likely to enroll in additional elective courses (Farmer et al., 1995 (Farmer et al., , 1999 Parsons [Eccles] et al., 1984; Updegraff et al., 1996) . Even though performance is associated with youths' beliefs and choices, few investigators have included measures of performance feedback, such as school grades, in their analyses. Thus, the unique relations between beliefs and choices, beyond their very high association with performance, are often not clear. A major aim of this study is to test longitudinal associations among participation in math and science activities, beliefs, and number of courses while taking into account the influence that performance feedback exerts on youths' beliefs and choices in these domains. We hypothesize that even though performance will influence beliefs and choices, youths' beliefs and choices will be strongly related across time.",

In order to examine the relations between choices and beliefs across this period, we included youths' beliefs at two time points, namely, beliefs in middle childhood (i.e., 6th grade) and in adolescence (i.e., 10th grade), which is when many children begin to choose elective high school courses (Updegraff et al., 1996) .

Math and physical science are often considered to be domains in which boys have high achievement, values, and self-concepts. On the contrary, math and science school achievement and grades are usually not significantly different between boys and girls (e.g., Farmer et al., 1995; Updegraff et al., 1996) , and sometimes girls outperform boys in both subject areas (Hay, Ashman, & Van Kraayenoord, 1998; Jacobs, 1991) . There are, however, marked differences in their beliefs and choices. Research has consistently shown that girls have lower math and science self-concepts than boys (Andre et al., 1999; Eccles & Harold, 1991; Eccles, Wigfield, Harold, & Blumenfeld, 1993; Jacobs, 1991; Jacobs & Eccles, 1992; Jacobs et al., 2002; Meece et al., 1990 ; Parsons [Eccles] et al., 1984 [Eccles] et al., , 1985 Stipek & Gralinski, 1991; Updegraff et al., 1996; Wigfield et al., 1991) . The evidence concerning gender differences in values is less consistent than self-concepts. Findings on youths' overall value, which includes both interest and beliefs about importance, suggest that boys and girls report similar values of mathematics and science (Andre et al., 1999; Eccles et al., 1993; Jacobs et al., 2002 ; Parsons [Eccles] et al., 1984 [Eccles] et al., , 1985 Wigfield et al., 1991) . When beliefs about importance is examined separately, however, findings have shown that boys attach greater personal importance to do well in math than girls (Andre et al., 1999; Eccles & Harold, 1991; Meece et al., 1990; Updegraff et al., 1996; Wigfield et al., 1991) .

The number of science courses and participation in out-of-school science activities, however, does not significantly differ by gender (Farmer et al., 1995 (Farmer et al., , 1999 Simpkins et al., 2005) , but this may be due to the fact that girls are more likely to favor the biological sciences and boys have higher representation in the physical sciences (Andre et al., 1999) . We hypothesize that boys will enroll in more math and physical science high school courses than girls but participate less often in math out-of-school activities.",

These relational differences can occur regardless of mean-level differences in youths' beliefs and choices. For example, even though boys had higher math beliefs and lower participation in out-of-school math activities, similar associations between math beliefs and time spent in outof-school math activities emerged for both boys and girls (Eccles & Harold, 1991; Paris, Yambor, & Packard, 1998 ; Parsons [Eccles] et al., 1984) . In this case, beliefs were positively associated with both boys' and girls' participation in math activities regardless of mean-level differences. Furthermore, these relations were similar in strength. Although child gender can be linked to mean-level and relational differences, the majority of research addressing this issue has only examined whether boys and girls differ according to their means. Thus, gender differences in the relations between beliefs and choices will also be examined in the bivariate associations and the overall model presented in Figure 1 . ",

We also hypothesize that boys will have higher self-beliefs and task beliefs, higher high school course enrollment, lower participation in activities, and similar academic achievement as girls. We will also examine whether relations among these indicators and the model in Figure 1 are different for boys and girls.",

Overall, however, the number of significantly different associations between boys and girls was quite small. Eighteen percent of the correlations (i.e., 8 of the 45 correlation pairs) among the science indicators were significantly different for boys and girls. Three of the correlations showed that girls' grades were more strongly associated with their adolescent beliefs and choices than boys' grades. Girls' science grades during 6th grade were positively associated with their 10th-grade interest and beliefs about importance (rs \u03ed .13 and .19, respectively). Boys' respective grades and beliefs were negatively related (rs \u03ed \u03ea.16 and \u03ea.08). In contrast to boys (r \u03ed .12), girls' science grades in 10th grade strongly predicted the number of physical science courses they took throughout high school (r \u03ed .46). Four of the intercorrelations among youths' beliefs were typically more strongly related for boys than girls. Boys' science self-concept at 10th grade was more strongly associated with their science interest and feelings about the importance of science at 6th grade than girls' indicators. In addition, boys' science interest at 10th grade was more strongly related to their feelings about the importance of science at 6th grade than girls' correlations. The association between science interest and self-concept at 10th grade was strong for both genders, but it was significantly stronger for girls than boys. The final correlation that was significantly different between boys and girls was the relation between activity participation and feelings of importance at 6th grade.

Researchers with missing data have two general options on how to handle missing data in AMOS. They can either deal with missing data before estimating the models (e.g., listwise deletion, imputation) or use full information maximum likelihood (FIML) in AMOS when estimating the models. As discussed at the end of the Method section, youth who had data at three or four waves had lower science self-concepts in 6th grade and math interest in 6th grade in comparison with youth who were missing data at two or more waves. These significant differences suggest that data were not missing completely at random. If the data had been missing completely at random, listwise deletion methods would have been appropriate. AMOS assumes the data are missing at random, which is not as strict of an assumption as missing completely at random (Arbuckle, 1996; Byrne, 2001) . When the data are missing at random, FIML yields results that are more accurate than other methods used to handle missing data, such as pairwise deletion, listwise deletion, or imputation (see Arbuckle, 1996 , for a discussion of FIML). Simulation studies have shown that even if the data are not missing at random, AMOS computes reasonable parameter and model estimates. Given the nature of the missing data, FIML was used to estimate the models.",

Multigroup analysis in AMOS was used to test gender differences in the models (Byrne, 2001) . Two models were estimated to examine gender differences in the overall model. First, a model was estimated in which all paths were free to vary across the two groups. In the second model, all of the paths and correlations depicted in Figure 1 plus the paths from each latent variable to its indicators (i.e., 1 correlation, 18 predictive paths, and 2-8 measurement paths per model) were restricted to have the same values across the two groups. In these restricted models, each path and correlation had to have the same value for boys and girls. Gender differences in the models were tested by calculating the change in the chi-square between the two models. The degrees of freedom were calculated by taking the difference in the degrees of freedom from the two models. If the change in the chi-square between the two models was significant, then the models were significantly different between boys and girls. A nonsignificant chi-square suggests that differences were not significant between the two models or that the same model fits both boys and girls.

Even when we controlled for the effect of science course grades at 10th grade, children's beliefs at 10th grade predicted the number of physical science courses they took throughout high school. In other words, youth who felt science was important, were interested in science, or believed they were good at science were more likely to take more physical science courses.

In earlier studies, values were particularly important for girls' math course enrollment (Parsons [Eccles] et al., 1984; Updegraff et al., 1996) . In contrast, we found that the number of high school courses was more strongly related to self-concepts rather than values. The difference in the relative strength of values versus ability self-concepts between our findings and previous research As competition for college admittance has escalated, college admission boards have placed increasing importance on grade point averages and advanced course work. These policies may have two implications on the relations between beliefs and courses for youth in this study. Because students in this sample are largely college bound, task value may not play such a large role, as many of the youth may know that these domains and courses are valuable for college and future occupations. In contrast, youths' self-concept may be critical because of its significant associations with grades. In essence, children with higher ability self-concepts may take more courses because of their expectancies to earn high grades in future courses. Second, studies from the 1970s and 1980s found that counselors and parents were more likely to let girls drop out of the advanced math sequence than boys, which may not be the case today because a substantial number of women are pursuing college degrees and prestigious occupations.",

Our results suggest that children who earn good grades in math and science are more likely to participate in after-school activities and continue with coursework in these areas. All beliefs were strongly associated with grades within 10th grade, but importance was not consistently associated with grades across time. For example, 5th-grade math grades predicted children's math interest and self-concept 1 year later. Yet, no such lagged relations occurred for beliefs about math importance. Self-concept of abilities and interest, however, are more likely to change in response to school grades (Eccles, 1994) .

One of the ways in which youth can exert choice in the domains of math and science during elementary school is the degree to which they engage in math and science activities outside of school. Yet, as children age into adolescence, their participation in out-of-school math and science activities significantly wanes. Their time outside of school is filled with extracurricular activities, hanging out with peers, homework, and part-time work (Larson & Verma, 1999) . In the majority of high schools, however, youth are increasingly given the ability to select their school courses, particularly whether they continue in upper level math and science courses.

We did not find significant gender differences in youths' course grades, the number of courses, or their value of these domains. Differences did emerge, however, in youths' math self-concept of abilities and out-of-school activity participation. Consistent with previous research, girls had lower math selfconcepts (Andre et al., 1999; Eccles & Harold, 1991; Eccles et al., 1993; Jacobs, 1991; Jacobs & Eccles, 1992; Jacobs et al., 2002 ; Meece et al., 1990 ; Parsons [Eccles] et al., 1984; Stipek & Gralinski, 1991; Updegraff et al., 1996; Wigfield et al., 1991) . Gender differences in children's choices were mixed. Our findings suggest that girls are less likely to participate in math activities than boys. The gender differences in children's participation in math activities confirms previous work (Eccles & Harold, 1991; Simpkins et al., 2005) and parallels research on gender differences in play styles (e.g., Maccoby, 1998) . Girls traditionally engage in less rough-and-tumble play and spend more time in fantasy games that revolve around household or school themes than boys. The math activities included as examples on the questionnaires (e.g., doing math puzzles, playing school and doing math problems) incorporate little physical activity and some build on feminine play themes. Although we found gender differences in math activities, we were surprised that gender differences did not emerge in the number of physical science courses youth took throughout high school. On the basis of previous findings, we expected that boys would have taken more physical science courses (Andre et al., 1999; Farmer et al., 1995) . These gender differences may not have emerged because many of the youth in our sample probably took multiple science courses to achieve college aspirations.",

These models suggest that, in comparison with girls, boys' science self-concept was more stable from 6th to 10th grade and that 10th-grade self-concept was a slightly stronger predictor of courses. Most of the differences in the model, however, occurred in relations including parent education. Parent education significantly predicted girls' 5th-grade science grades and activity participation but not the number of physical science courses they took throughout high school. The opposite associations emerged for boys. These relations suggest that parent education has an early impact on girls' science choices and performance but a later impact on boys. This early impact on girls' indicators is consistent with research suggesting that parents may have a larger impact on girls in regard to math than boys (Jacobs, Davis-Kean, Bleeker, Eccles, & Malanchuk, 2005) . The gender differences between parent education and number of physical science courses may result from differential expectations. The influence of parent education may be small above the impact of girls' self-concept. In other words, parents may allow girls more freedom in their course choices. On the other hand, boys whose parents are more educated may expect their sons to take physical science courses regardless of boys' self-concepts. The differential relations including parent education emerged in one of the six models, which suggest that gender-specific processes are possible but may be subtle.",

Even though this study extended prior research in multiple regards, there are some limitations to the findings. Perhaps the strongest limitation of the study is the demographic characteristics of the families. The families who participated in this study were largely two-parent, European American families with middle-class incomes. As a result, they may have more resources to devote to children's participation in organized activities and creating an enriching home environment than families of other socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. Recent research, for example, shows that families from lower SES brackets are less likely to have computers in the home (Zarrett, Malanchuk, Davis-Kean, & Eccles, in press) . As a result, children in lower SES families are likely to get less exposure to early math and science skills. In addition, low-income families' efforts may need to be devoted to children's basic needs (e.g., providing food and safety) rather than supporting or promoting youths' pursuit of math and science because of other life circumstances (e.g., working two jobs, overriding concern about their child's safety in a high-crime neighborhood). Little math and science support in the home may make children less likely to be exposed to early math and science activities, values, and role models and, as a result, less likely to pursue math-and science-enriched pathways.",

Ethnic differences in educational and occupational expectations are likely to influence the model discussed in this article. Youths' beliefs may not have a large influence on choices above parental beliefs in cultures with strong educational values, such as many Asian cultures, or cultures in which parents largely make choices for youth. If youth in particular cultures are expected to enroll in all upper level math and science courses or use a majority of their out-of-school time for educational pursuits, children's beliefs, particularly when they are young, may make little difference. In fact, findings by Eccles and Harold (1991) suggested that the relations between beliefs and activity participation in more voluntary activities, such as sports and music, may be stronger than those academic activities discussed in this article. They theorized that the associations were likely to be stronger in sports because youth were allowed more freedom to decide whether they want to engage in sports than math. Cultural differences in the freedom youth have to make choices concerning their time use, education, and occupations are likely to change the strength of relations between beliefs and choices.",

Because our activity measure was global and included both formal and informal activities, youth may gain similar motivational benefits if they participate in math and science activities through an organized afterschool program or through informal activities at home.

                "text": "These findings advocate that building youths' self-concepts in these domains is key to promoting course choices for both boys and girls. Although youths' grades had an influence on their choices, the influence of self-concepts, or one's beliefs about their abilities in that domain, was even stronger. This finding suggests that parents and educators should devote time and effort to not just building children's knowledge and skills in these areas but also to developing children's beliefs. Even though values did not play a significant role in these models, it is probable that youth with the highest persistence are those who have high self-concepts and values. The particular belief or set of beliefs that matter may vary by ethnic or racial groups. Thus, it would be advantageous if self-concepts and values were both addressed in future studies.",
