The sample included 100 Black, Latino, and Asian American adolescents from low-income families. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the increase over time in reported levels of self-esteem was significantly greater for those who reported more positive perceptions of school climate at Time 1. Unexpectedly, the increase in self-esteem and the decrease in depressive symptoms over time were also significantly greater for those who reported lower family support at Time 1. Post hoc analyses were conducted to better understand the patterns detected. Findings underscore the importance of positive school experiences for students' psychological well-being and the need to examine the meaning of family support.",

                "text": "The importance of family and peer support and school experiences on the psychological adjustment of adolescents has been underscored by numerous theorists and researchers. Researchers have typically found that the perceived quality of family relationships, friendships, and/or school experiences are associated positively with psychological adjustment as indicated by self-esteem and/or depressive symptoms (DuBois, Felner, Brand, Adan, & Evans, 1992; Eccles, Early, Frasier, Belansky, & McCarthy, 1997; Harter & Whitesell, 1996; Hughes & Demo, 1989; Luster & McAdoo, 1995; McFarlane, Bellissimo, & Norman, 1995) . Few studies, however, have examined prospectively the relative influence of families, peers, and school experiences on the psychological adjustment of adolescents. Studies have typically been concurrent or cross-sectional and have focused on the effects of families and peers (separately or together) or of school experiences (e.g., Hoge, Smit, & Hanson, 1990 ) on psychological adjustment. In addition, few longitudinal studies have examined the predictors of psychological adjustment among ethnic minority and/or low-income adolescents. Although there exists some research on the predictors of psychological adjustment among African American, middle-class, and low-income adolescents (see Eccles et al., 1997; Coates, 1985; DuBois et al., 1992; Luster & McAdoo, 1995; Taylor, Casten, & Flickinger, 1993) , there exists almost no research on the predictors of psychological adjustment among Asian American or Latino adolescents of any socioeconomic status. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine prospectively the influence of perceptions of family support, friendship support, and school climate on psychological adjustment (i.e., selfesteem and depressive symptoms) among Black, Latino, and Asian American adolescents from low-income families.",

Drawing from Cooley's (1902) conception of the \"looking glass self\" (p. 184), researchers have found that self-worth and depressed affect are influenced by one's perceptions of support from family members (Harter & Whitesell, 1996; Luster & McAdoo, 1995; Rubin et al., 1992) . Luster and McAdoo (1995) found in their study of 123 African American, low-income adolescents that the perceived quality of family relationships was positively correlated with selfesteem. Similarly, Harter and Whitesell (1996) in their cross-sectional study of 1,725 middle-class, primarily White adolescents found that parental support was positively associated with psychological adjustment (i.e., global self-worth and depressed affect). A few researchers have found that the association between perceptions of family support and psychological adjustment is moderated by gender. In their study of the relative influence of family and peer influence on depressed affect among adolescents, Rubin et al. (1992) noted that perceptions of family cohesion made an independent contribution to depressed affect only among the girls in their sample. Furthermore, under conditions of high stress, girls were found to be more \"protected\" emotionally by their family relationships than boys. Armsden (1986) has also noted that the correlation between parental support and self-esteem is higher for girls than for boys.",

Peers and friends are assumed to play an increasingly important role in the lives of adolescents (Savin-Williams & Berndt, 1990) . Research has typically found that perceived friendship quality, peer support, or attachment to friends is positively associated with self-esteem (Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Buhrmester & Yin, 1997; Cauce, 1986; Coates, 1985; Dubow & Ullman, 1989; Hirsch & Rapkin, 1987; Keefe & Berndt, 1996; Ryan, Stiller, & Lynch, 1994) and negatively associated with both depressive symptoms (Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Compas, Slavin, Wagner, & Vannatta, 1986; Licitra-Klecker & Waas, 1993) and psychosocial disturbance (Berndt & Hawkins, 1985; Buhrmester, 1990) . Way and Chen (2000) and Berndt and Savin-Williams (1993) have found that friendship support is positively associated with self-esteem and negatively associated with depressed feelings. Those who express greater satisfaction with their friends or peers typically report feeling better about themselves than those who express less satisfaction with friends and peers. A few studies, however, have indicated that this relationship is moderated by gender (DuBois & Hirsch, 1993; Fenzel & Blyth, 1986) , with activities with best friends or contact with peers being associated with higher self-esteem for boys but not for girls.",

                "text": "Similar to the research on families, a limitation of much of the research on friendships has been its cross-sectional approach (Buhrmester & Yin, 1997) . The research that has been longitudinal has found that although psychologi-cal adjustment (e.g., self-esteem and/or depressive symptoms) and friendship quality are highly correlated in concurrent data, friendship quality does not predict self-esteem over time (DuBois et al., 1992; Keefe & Berndt, 1996) . In their 1-year longitudinal study of junior high students' self-esteem and friendship support, Keefe and Berndt (1996) found that friendship support did not significantly predict changes over time in self-esteem. This finding, however, may have been due to the small amount of change in selfesteem over 1 year. Consequently, longitudinal research spanning a longer time period (more than 1 year) may be necessary to discern differences in self-esteem as a function of friendship support. Additionally, a lack of longitudinal relations between friendships and self-esteem may be limited to early adolescence, a time of considerable change in both the nature of friendships (Hartup, 1996) and in self-definition (Harter, 1990) . Consistent with this possibility, Buhrmester (1990) found that the association between friendship intimacy and psychological adjustment is relatively weak during preadolescence but is stronger during adolescence. This finding is congruent with Harry Stack Sullivan's (1953) theory that emphasizes the increasing importance of intimacy in friendships for the evaluation of self-worth during adolescence. Buhrmester and Yin (1997) found, in fact, that the quality of friendships among adolescents significantly predicted psychological adjustment (self-esteem and depressive symptoms) 2 years later. This small body of longitudinal research has been conducted primarily with White workingclass or middle-class adolescents. Consequently, the influence of friendship support over time on the psychological adjustment of ethnic minority and/or low-income adolescents is relatively unknown.",

School climate has often been defined as the quality of interactions among and between adults and students in a school community (Kuperminc, Leadbeater, Emmons, & Blatt, 1997) . Researchers have commonly found that perceptions of school climate significantly predict psychological adjustment (Bachman & O'Malley, 1986; Hoge et al., 1990; Kuperminc et al., 1997; . Middle school students' perceptions of school climate, for example, appear to predict self-esteem even after accounting for demographic factors such as IQ, sex, race, single-parent family, and socioeconomic status (Bachman & O'Malley, 1986; Hoge et al., 1990) . Similarly, in their study of 1,041 White and African American adolescents from socioeconomically diverse families, reported that early adolescents' perceptions of overall school climate and positive teacher regard predicted positive changes in emotional adjustment during the middle school years. In addition, early adolescents who perceived their teachers as emotionally supportive were less likely to experience alienation from school or emotional distress. Epstein and Karweit (1983) also noted that those students who do not feel safe at school may experience isolation at school and may, consequently, report lower self-esteem and higher depressive symptoms than those who experience their school to be safer and/or more supportive.",

This strategy for determining the predictors of change over time has been used repeatedly by researchers (Allen, Hauser, Bell, & O'Connor, 1994; Cohen & Cohen, 1975; DuBois et al., 1992; Dubow, Tisak, Causy, Hryshko, & Reid, 1991; Hoge et al., 1990; Keefe & Berndt, 1996; . In this method for examining change over time, the beta coefficients for the independent variables represent either the direction of change or the magnitude of change in the dependent variable that is predicted by the independent variables (see Cohen & Cohen, 1975) . The interpretation of the beta coefficients is determined by an examination of the change over time in the mean score of the dependent variable for the sample as a whole. If there is no significant change over time in the mean score for the sample as a whole, the beta coefficients for the independent variables in the model represent the direction of change in the dependent variable that is predicted by the independent variables. If there is a significant increase or decrease over time in the mean score of the dependent variable in the sample as a whole, the beta coefficients for the independent variables in the model represent the magnitude of change in the dependent variable that is predicted by the independent variables. In the current analysis, a t test revealed a significant increase in the mean score of self-esteem (t = 4.80, p < .001) over time for the total sample. Thus, the beta coefficients for the contextual variables for this analysis will reveal the magnitude of change in self-esteem over time that is predicted by the contextual variables.",

No significant interaction effects were found. Additionally, as subtle interaction effects can be difficult to detect in the context of a complex multivariate model, each of the six possible interaction terms was entered into a regression model containing only Time 1 self-esteem (Step 1), one demographic predictor (Step 2), one contextual predictor (Step 3), and the appropriate interaction term (Step 4). Because there were no significant interaction effects using this less conservative method, the interaction terms were dropped from the final model and the demographic predictors were used as control variables in the final regression model. The final regression model accounted for 45% of the variance in selfesteem assessed at Time 3 (see Table 2 ). Self-esteem at Time 1 alone accounted for 31% of the variance in self-esteem at Time 3. Gender and ethnicity accounted for an additional 8% of the variance in self-esteem. The addition of the contextual variables entered in Step 3 contributed an additional 6% to the explained variance in self-esteem. The increase in reported levels of self-esteem from Time 1 to Time 3 was significantly greater for those who reported lower family support at Time 1 than for those who reported higher family support (see Figure 1) . In addition, the increase in reported levels of self-esteem from Time 1 to Time 3 was significantly greater for those who reported more positive perceptions of school climate at Time 1 than for those who reported less positive perceptions of school climate (see Figure 2 ). Perceived friendship support did not contribute significantly to change in self-esteem but demonstrated a trend toward significance, indicating that higher levels of perceived friendship support predicted a greater increase in self-esteem from Time 1 to Time 3 than did lower levels of perceived friendship support.",

We first examined these associations for curvilinearity to examine whether perceived family support and change in self-esteem and depressive symptoms differed as a function of level of Time 1 family support. There was no evidence of a quadratic trend in the relationship between Time 1 family support and change in self-esteem or depressive symptoms. We also explored if those adolescents who reported significant changes in self-esteem and depressive symptoms over time experienced a significant change in their perceived family support from Time 1 to Time 3. Did the adolescents who, for example, reported lower family support at Time 1 and whose self-esteem increased more sharply over time also report an increase in perceived family support over time? To address this question, a change score was computed for perceived family support by subtracting Time 1 family support from Time 3 family support. These change scores were then entered into the second step of a regression model containing Time 1 selfesteem. This analysis indicated that change in perceived family support was a positive predictor of change in self-esteem (\u03b2 = .27, p < .01), suggesting that, in fact, the increase in self-esteem over time was associated with an increase in family support over time. A similar analysis examining the prediction of change in depressive symptoms revealed change in family support to be a significant negative predictor of change in depressive symptoms (\u03b2 = -.30, p < .01), suggesting that an increase in family support over time predicts a significant decline in depressive symptoms from Time 1 to Time 3. 1 These post hoc analyses suggest that those adolescents who experienced an increase in self-esteem or a decrease in depressive symptoms from Time 1 to Time 3 also experienced an increase in perceived family support from Time 1 to Time 3. A close examination of the family support scores at Times 1 and 3 revealed, however, that family support scores significantly increased from Time 1 to Time 3 only for those who reported low family support scores (i.e., below the mean) at Time 1. Therefore, the analyses, in sum, indicated that an increase in family support over time was associated with an increase in self-esteem and a decrease in depressive symptoms, but this association was only evident among those who reported low family support at Time 1.",

Support from school personnel was found to contribute significantly to a decrease in perceived psychological distress at a 2-year follow-up, over and above the effects of family and friend support. Eccles et al. (1997) also found, in a sample of 1,387 African American and White early adolescents, that perceived school climate explained a unique amount of the variance in adolescent adjustment after controlling for perceptions of home and peers. These findings underscore the importance of school experiences in the social and emotional lives of adolescents. Schools, or the interpersonal relationships that exist within a school setting, not only influence adolescents'academic achievement, goals, and ideals but also their psychological well-being. In addition, the effects of perceived school climate on psychological adjustment appear to persist during the middle and high school years.",

The relative importance of family support over friendship support in the prediction of psychological adjustment has been noted in previous research (Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Paterson et al., 1995) . What was unexpected, however, was the direction of effect. Contrary to most research on family support, our findings suggested that lower family support at Time 1 was associated with a greater increase over time in self-esteem scores than was higher family support at Time 1. Lower family support at Time 1 was also associated with a greater decrease in depressive symptoms over time. Our post hoc analyses indicated that the increase in self-esteem and decrease in depressive symptoms corresponded with a significant increase in family support over time. Yet a close examination of mean scores of family support over time indicated that such patterns were only evident among those reporting lower family support at Time 1. In sum, an increase in perceived family support is associated with an increase in self-esteem and a decrease in depressive symptoms, but these associations are evident only for those who are least supported by their families at Time 1.",

The self-esteem of an adolescent who does not perceive his or her family to be supportive may be low: This is what our correlation table indicates. If the level of perceived family support increases over time, however, the self-esteem of this adolescent may benefit more than that of an adolescent who is less psychologically vulnerable. An increase in family support over time for those already receiving much support from their families may not be as psychologically meaningful as an increase in family support over time for those receiving little family support. Additional research is needed to determine when, how, and for whom perceived family support influences the psychological adjustment of adolescents.",

Although friendship support has been repeatedly found to be a concurrent correlate of psychological adjustment, other researchers have noted that friendship support does not appear to be a significant predictor of changes over time in psychological adjustment (DuBois et al., 1992; Hirsch & DuBois, 1991; Keefe & Berndt, 1996; McFarlane et al., 1995; Zimmerman & Maton, 1992) . Keefe and Berndt (1996) noted that previous researchers using correlational data may have \"exaggerated the effects of supportive friendships on self-esteem\" (p. 112). Yet some studies have found that friendship support predicted changes in self-esteem 2 years later (Buhrmester & Yin, 1997) , and the present study indicated that friendship support at Time 1 was almost significant in the prediction of change over time in self-esteem, over and above the effects of family support and perceived school climate. With a larger sample, the effects of friendship support at Time 1 on the magnitude of changes in selfesteem may have been significant. Additional longitudinal research with larger samples of ethnically and socioeconomically diverse adolescents is needed to determine if and when friendship support at one time point is a significant predictor of change over time in self-esteem and/or depressive symptoms.",

The study, however, had var-ious limitations including its small sample size. In addition, only support from family and friends was examined. Parenting styles, family structures, or the structure of friendship networks may also influence the psychological adjustment of adolescents (Savin-Williams & Berndt, 1990; Steinberg, 1990) . Other factors within the school, such as the academic tracking system, may also shape the psychological adjustment of the students. Future research needs to examine the form and content of family relationships and friendships, and the multiple dimensions of school environments that may affect psychological adjustment among adolescents. Furthermore, the quality of the neighborhood in which the adolescent resides, the quality of after-school activities (e.g., sports activities), and ethnic identity have been shown to influence the way that adolescents feel about themselves (Erkut, Fields, Sing, & Marx, 1996; Roberts et al., 1999; Way, 1998) . Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the multiple predictors of change in psychological adjustment between adolescents and the relative influence of each of these predictors over time.",

It is, therefore, critical that this segment of the adolescent population be included in psychological studies of adjustment.
