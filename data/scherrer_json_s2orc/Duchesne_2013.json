Achievement goal orientations (AG) are cognitive representations that guide individual conceptions of competence as well as the criteria for judging that competence (Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Nicholls, 1984) . They form a tacit agenda, a meaning system (Dweck & Grant, 2008) , that conditions how individuals approach a task, are motivated to accomplish the task and engage in it, and their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses while performing it . Although many empirical studies support a strong association between AG and learning (Harackiewicz, Barron, Tauer, Carter, & Elliot, 2000) , few have traced chronological changes in these goals or sought to more deeply understand individual differences in goal orientation development. Consequently, it has yet to be determined whether developmental changes in AG follow a homogeneous trajectory or whether different subgroups of students follow distinct developmental trajectories.",

                "text": "A variety of cross-sectional and short-term longitudinal studies have associated behavioral and emotional dispositions with AG orientations Kaplan & Maehr, 1999) . However, none to date has determined the contribution of these dispositions to AG development. Given the effects of these goals on academic engagement and success, it would appear critical to gain a better understanding of how AG endorsement fluctuates over the years in distinct subgroups of students and to identify the personal dispositions associated with these changes. This longitudinal study had two objectives: (a) to identify and describe development trajectories associated with high AG using yearly surveys from the end of elementary school (Grade 6) to the third year of middle school (Grade 9); and (b) to verify whether individual variations are predicted by specific behavioral (aggressiveness, attention problems) and emotional (anxiety and depression) dispositions measured at the end of elementary school. Duchesne et al. 3 Achievement Goals: Conceptualization, Consequences, and Continuity Seminal work on achievement goal theory (Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Nicholls, 1984) has highlighted the mastery and performance approach goal orientations. Mastery goals focus on the development of abilities and task mastery. Students who adopt these goals typically have autonomous motivations for engaging in a task (i.e., based on pleasure and importance) and judge their successes and setbacks by their own standards. In contrast, performance goals are oriented toward a comparative demonstration of abilities. Students who adopt these goals have more controlled motivations for engaging in a task or activity (i.e., to demonstrate ability or conceal inability), and they judge their abilities based on social comparison. In the 1990s, Elliot and his colleagues (Elliot, 1999; Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996) proposed a distinction between approach and avoidance-performance goals. The desire to demonstrate ability, outperform others, and attain success and recognition was indicative of performance-approach goals, whereas the desire to avoid appearing incompetent indicated performance-avoidance goals. The same distinction was made for mastery goals, with the addition of mastery-avoidance goals (Elliot, 1999 (Elliot, , 2005 . Although these goals represent a drive to develop and improve one's competence, there is also the fear that these competences could stagnate or decline with time. However, the present study focuses on the trichotomous AG framework (i.e., mastery-approach, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals), which has dominated in recent years (Pekrun, Elliot, & Maier, 2009) .",

The middle school transition provides an informative window on this question, given the many changes that take place during this period (e.g., school structure, curriculum, teaching practices, classroom groupings, assessment systems), which are likely to affect students' motivational dynamics (Eccles & Roeser, 2011) . Though scant, the data to date largely support the idea that goals change during this period. For example, in a two-stage study conducted over a 1-year interval with students in Grades 5 and 6, Anderman and Midgley (1997) reported a decline in mastery goals while performanceapproach goals remained stable. In another study that focused on the same school years, Anderman and Anderman (1999) showed that mastery goals decreased and performance-approach goals increased.

First, these studies used analytical strategies (e.g., analyses of variance and growth curves) that assumed similar fluctuation patterns across individuals (Raudenbush, 2001 ). This dimensional, or variable-centered, approach does not allow the identification of distinct developmental patterns. However, research that examined motivational development using a person-centered approach demonstrated that learning motivation assumes heterogeneous trajectories in the middle school transition (Duchesne, Larose, Guay, Vitaro, & Tremblay, 2005; Ratelle, Guay, Larose, & Sen\u00e9cal, 2004) . Accordingly, we expect trajectories of AG to be heterogeneous, that is, not all students should report decreased goal endorsement, and that developmental trajectories for each goal may vary differently across subgroups of students. For example, some students might report a stable trajectory (e.g., high mastery orientation before and after the transition), whereas others might experience a declining (e.g., markedly reduced performance-approach goals) or an ascending trajectory (e.g., gradually increasing performance-avoidance goals). In the present study, group-based trajectory modeling (Nagin, 1999 (Nagin, , 2005 was applied to developmental trajectories of goal endorsement to test this hypothesis.",

These latter studies have shown that traits such as hope, extraversion, conscientiousness, and positive affect were associated with approach goals (mastery and performance), whereas neuroticism and negative affect were associated with both approach and avoidance performance goals (Chen & Zhang, 2011; Daniels, Stupnisky, Pekrun, Haynes, Perry, & Newall, 2009; Elliot & Thrash, 2002) . Relationships have also been found between behavioral activation system (BAS) and approach goals, and between behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and performance-avoidance goals (Elliot & Thrash, 2002) . In general, research suggests that AG partly result from complementary dispositions that orient behavior toward seeking positive stimuli (approach behavior) and avoiding negative stimuli (avoidance behavior).",

A number of studies have shown that children with symptoms of inattention, accompanied or not by hyperactivity and impulsivity, were more easily frustrated when performing school tasks (Milich, 1994; Milich & Okazaki, 1991) and less likely to persevere in these tasks (Hoza, Pelham, Waschbusch, Kipp, & Owens, 2001; Milich & Okazaki, 1991) . In addition, at least two studies have provided direct support for a relationship between attention problems and AG (see also Johnson & Reid, 2011) . Specifically, Carlson, Booth, Shin, and Canu (2002) showed that children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were perceived by their parents and teachers as being less oriented toward mastery and performanceapproach goals than children without ADHD. Children with ADHD were also less likely to select challenging tasks and more likely to judge their performance in light of external feedback. Furthermore, Barron, Evans, Baranik, Serpell, and Buvinger (2006) found that students with ADHD were more oriented toward performance-avoidance than performance-approach goals and less oriented toward performance-approach goals than students without ADHD.",

Students with certain attention problems were expected to have (a) a higher probability of belonging to trajectories characterized by high performance-avoidance goals; and (b) a lower probability of belonging to trajectories characterized by higher approach goals (mastery and performance). Students with attention problems usually have difficulty concentrating and organizing complex tasks, and are more likely to be motivated toward such tasks, to disengage from them, and to experience failure (e.g., Barkley, 2006) . The combination of attention and learning problems could progressively encourage them to adopt performance-avoidance goals (orientation toward negative stimuli) rather than mastery or performance-approach goals (orientation toward positive stimuli).",

These behaviors have frequently been associated with a cascade of negative events, such as rejection by conventional peers (Boivin, Vitaro, & Poulin, 2005; Dishion, Piehler, & Myers, 2008) and poor performance (Duchesne et al., 2005; Hinshaw, 1992; Rumberger, 1995) . Furthermore, aggressiveness dimensions have been related to AG. For example, Kaplan and Maehr (1999) showed that mastery goals were positively related to impulse control (e.g., being calm and in control) and negatively to classroom disruptive behaviors (e.g., fooling around and making teachers angry), whereas performance-approach goals were associated with impulsivity and disruption. Cheung, Ma, and Shek (1998) found that antisocial behaviors (e.g., disobeying parents) were positively associated with performance-approach goals, particularly in young girls. They also reported that students who were mastery oriented tended to help, cooperate, and share more, whereas performance-oriented students were less likely to help their peers.",

Students whose behaviors are detrimental to the quality of their interpersonal relationships might conceivably be concerned about the social image they project. They might consequently seek to validate their abilities (performance-approach goals) in an attempt to improve their image or to show that they can succeed without others' help. In addition, as these students are also at greater risk for learning problems, they would also approach learning situations with a concern to limit the risks of failure and humiliation (performance-avoidance goals).",

Depression refers to feelings of sadness and hopelessness, accompanied by lack of interest, feelings of worthlessness, and so on (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). These emotions affect memory, concentration, executive functions, and motivation (see Castaneda, Tuulio-Henriksson, Marttunen, Suvisaari, & L\u00f6nnqvist, 2008) , and they predict poorer learning in middle school (e.g., Duchesne et al., 2005; Fr\u00f6jd et al., 2008) . At the same time, a few studies have reported associations between emotions and AG. For example, anxiety (e.g., worries, test anxiety) has been positively associated with performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals but unrelated to mastery goals Linnenbrink, 2005; Middleton & Midgley, 1997) . Depressive symptoms have been negatively related to mastery goals but positively to performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals Dykman, 1998) . In addition, mastery goals have been related to increased positive affects (e.g., happiness) and decreased negative affect (e.g., sadness), whereas performance-avoidance goals have been associated with increased negative affect and performance-approach goals have been associated with both positive and negative affect (Daniels et al., 2009; Kaplan & Maehr, 1999; Linnenbrink, 2005; Pekrun et al., 2009) .",

This analytical strategy allows grouping students according to their naturally occurring similarities and differences in terms of AG fluctuations during and after the middle school transition. Given the exploratory nature of this objective, no explicit hypotheses were formulated regarding the number and configuration of the obtained trajectories. The second was to examine the role of behavioral and emotional dispositions in predicting AG trajectories, while controlling for students' gender, performance, and perceptions of academic competence, which were found to predict AG (see Hyde & Durik, 2005 , Kaplan, Middleton, Urdan, & Midgley, 2002 , and Senko, Hulleman, & Harackiewicz, 2011 . Particular attention was paid to gender as a potential moderator of the relationship between behavioral and emotional dispositions and AG trajectories, because boy and girls have frequently been found to differ on these variables. For example, other things being equal, girls tend to have more emotional problems than boys (Duchesne, Ratelle, Poitras, & Drouin, 2009; Kendall et al., 2006) but fewer behavioral problems (see McMahon & Kotler, 2006) . Girls are also more concerned about how adults judge their academic performance (Pomerantz, Altermatt, & Saxon, 2002) , more mastery-oriented, and less performance-oriented (e.g., Bouffard, Boisvert, Vezeau, & Larouche, 1995; Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Poulin et al., 2010) . Thus, the strength of associations among individual dispositions and AG trajectories may be greater for girls than for boys for anxiety and depression but not for inattention and aggressiveness. Due to the exploratory nature of the potential moderating effect of gender, no specific hypotheses were formulated.",

Most of the students were born in the province of Quebec (92.83%), spoke French at home (97.18 %), and grew up in intact families (70.89%). The mother of each participating child was also asked to participate. The average age of mothers was 40.38 years (SD = 4.76) and the mean reported family income was from CAD$50,000 to CAD$59,000.

The sample was stratified according to gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic location (rural vs. urban). Once the parent gave consent, a communication was mailed, including (a) a written consent form for the parent to sign, indicating agreement to participate in the study, (b) a written consent form for the child to complete, (c) a prestamped self-addressed return envelope, and (d) two questionnaires: a parent version and a student version. Mothers and their children could also choose to complete an electronic version of questionnaire, for which they were given a confidential access code to a secure website.

This questionnaire contains three subscales: Mastery Goals (five items), Performance-Approach Goals (five items), and Performance-Avoidance Goals (four items). Students were asked to indicate the degree to which each statement corresponded to their intentions on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very little or not at all) to 5 (very much). The Mastery Goals subscale measured the extent to which students engaged in learning activities in order to develop competence (e.g., \"It is important to me that I improve my skills this year\"). The performanceapproach subscale assessed how important it was for students to outperform their peers (e.g., \"One of my goals is to show others that I'm good at my class work\"). The performance-avoidance subscale measured the extent to which students were concerned with hiding the fact that they were less competent than their peers (e.g., \"It's important to me that my teacher doesn't think that I know less than others in class\"). Previous research (e.g., Midgley et al., 2000; supports the psychometric qualities of these subscales. In the current study, the internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's \u03b1) at each of the assessment periods are as follows: mastery goals (Grade 6 \u03b1 = .78; Grade 7 = .85; Grade 8 = .87; and Grade 9 = .83), performance-approach goals (Grade 6 = .82; Grade 7 = .88; Grade 8 = .88; and Grade 9 = .89), and performance-avoidance goals (Grade 6 = .76; Grade 7 = .79; Grade 8 = .83; and Grade 9 = .84).",

Losier et al. (1993) reported a coefficient of internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1) of .81 for this subscale and a test-retest reliability coefficient of .84 after 1 month. In the present study, the Cronbach's \u03b1 was .70. Grades in French and mathematics were self-reported by students at the end of Grade 6, and the average mark was 83.53% (SD = 9.95) in French and 85.06% (SD = 9.98) in mathematics. Given the size of the correlation coefficient between grades in French and Mathematics (r = .61, p < .001), an overall score (academic achievement) was used as a covariable.",

These results indicated that AG were relatively stable over time, with correlation coefficients ranging from .43 (mastery goals at Time 1 and Time 2) to .68 (performance-approach goals at Time 3 and Time 4). Nevertheless, this apparent stability could be misleading for certain student subgroups, for whom these goals fluctuated from high to low within the time window studied. Moreover, the analysis also revealed that the magnitude of the relationships between performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals was strong and positive at each measuring time (Time 1: r = .78; Time 2: r = .80; Time 3: r = .84; Time 4: r = .83), suggesting that these goals tend to co-occur, at least in this sample.",

                "text": "The first objective of this study was to identify developmental trajectories for mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals from the end of elementary school to the third year of middle school. We used the PROC TRAJ procedure (Jones et al., 2001; Jones & Nagin, 2007) to estimate a model with the optimal number of trajectories. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used as a first empirical criterion for determining both the optimal number of groups and the shape of their trajectories. Because BIC values are negative, the higher values are the least negative one. A second criterion is membership probability. For each trajectory group, each student received a belonging probability score, ranging from 0 (low) to 1 (high). A probability of .70 or higher is deemed acceptable (Nagin, 2005) . For each goal type, mixture models for one, two, three, four, and five groups were estimated, with each trajectory described by a second-order polynomial function (i.e., constant only, linear, and quadratic trends). The quadratic trend was specified for each developmental trajectory. When this trend was found to be nonsignificant, we considered the lower order significant trends, starting with the linear trend and, if appropriate, constant only (see Nagin, 2005) . The BIC scores for mastery goals were \u22121,468.08 (2 groups), \u22121,458.51 (3 groups), \u22121,464.24 (4 groups), and \u22121,469.55 (5 groups). The model solutions for performance-approach goals showed the following BIC scores: \u22121,724.10 (2 groups), \u22121,712.99 (3 groups), \u22121,713.18 (4 groups), and \u22121,799.40 (5 groups). The BIC scores for performance-avoidance goals were \u22121,839.28 (2 groups), \u22121,832.18 (3 groups), \u22121,832.43 (4 groups), and \u22121,851.45 (5 groups). A difference >3 in BIC scores between two models strongly indicates a difference between the two models (Nagin, 1999 (Nagin, , 2005 . For models tested with mastery goals, the BIC scores suggested that the optimal solution includes three groups. However, for the performance-approach and performance-approach goals, the BIC scores did not clearly distinguish between the three-and four-group models. In such cases, it is recommended to decide on the basis of more subjective criteria such as knowledge of the domain, purpose of the analysis, practical utility of the model, class size, and interpretable results (see Dup\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2007; Nagin, 2005; Nagin & Odgers, 2010) . Thus, we retained the four-group model, as it allowed describing trajectories that were at once distinct and opposed, unlike the three-group model, which contained very similar trajectories. Figures 1, 2, and 3 illustrate the estimated trajectories. Solid lines represent actual trajectories and dotted lines represent predicted trajectories calculated using the model's estimated coefficients. Students within each group shared similar patterns of variation and AG level. The probability of belonging to each group, conditional on assignment by the maximum probability rule, varied from .61 to .85 (see Table 2 ).",

Second, the results suggest that performance-approach goals become increasingly prevalent, but only for some students (about one in eight students). Third, most students showed a decline in both performance-approach and performanceavoidance goals. Nevertheless, there are substantial gaps before their initial levels (i.e., upon entering secondary school), and even though these gaps tended to diminish, they may still be present in Secondary 2 and 3.

This could be explained by the fact that both goal types are preceded by fear of failure, which is based on social comparison, and the fact that it is difficult to detect subtle differences between them using a written questionnaire (see Anderman & Patrick, 2012; Murayama, Elliot, & Yamagata, 2011) . The results also showed that students in the high mastery goal trajectory were more likely to belong to higher performance-avoidance goal trajectories. This might signal the presence of a subgroup of students who adopted mastery-avoidance goals (Elliot, 1999 (Elliot, , 2005 ) such that they would focus on developing competence and at the same time fear to losing their competence.",

Recall that the comparison groups comprised students in the low trajectories for these goals. While we cannot rule out the possibility that these counterintuitive findings might be explained by students endorsing mastery-avoidance goals, it might more have to do with them pursuing multiple goals (e.g., Poulin et al., 2010) . Our findings also suggest a long-term association between anxiety and performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals. Given that these goals tend to co-occur and that they both stem from fear of failure (Murayama et al., 2011) , it is possible that an anxious disposition would orient the motivational intentions of students according to whether or not they anticipate failure or have high personal standards of performance . In the case of anticipated success, anxiety could be felt as an internal pressure (e.g., \"I must be the best\"), which would drive students to engage in the task in order to demonstrate their knowledge and outperform other students, to achieve social recognition for example (performance-approach). Inversely, if failure is anticipated or the outcome is unpredictable, anxious thoughts could orient intentions toward actions designed to preserve one's social image and psychological well-being (performance-avoidance).",

On the other hand, exposure to a performance goal classroom structure predicted adjustment problems in second year for students who expressed anxiety about entering secondary school. Based on these data, we might assume that, despite their tendency to worry, some adolescents could feel a decreasing need to demonstrate their competence or to mask their incompetence if they felt that they were making progress in a class headed by an autonomy-supportive teacher who recognized their efforts and conveyed the message that errors are part and parcel of the learning process (mastery goal structure).",

The strengths of this study lie in the methodology (accounting for three types of learning goals; analysis over a 4-year period; use of both student's and mother's perspective; control for academic characteristics), some limitations must also be considered. First, the sample was relatively homogenous in terms of ethnicity (Caucasian), language (French), and socioeconomic status (middle class). Further studies should be conducted in samples that include youth with clinical symptoms of anxiety, depression, aggressiveness, and inattention, and/or with varying ethnic origins and socioeconomic status. Second, AG was measured as a general disposition to engage in a task regardless of subject area. Further studies are needed to determine whether the trajectories identified here differ according to subject. Third, students' dispositions were assessed at the beginning of the goal trajectories. Consequently, we could not determine reciprocal effects between these dispositions and goal orientations. Given that emotional and behavioral dispositions may be present at a very early age (e.g., Duchesne, Vitaro, Larose, & Tremblay, 2008) , future studies could assess these dispositions even before school age to more precisely identify the relationship direction. Finally, the fact that the students' dispositions did not allow distinguishing the Moderate mastery goal trajectory from the Low trajectory raises the need to consider the social context. Certain parental behaviors as well as goal structures in the classroom have been related to AG (e.g., Wolters, 2004) . The interplay between such external factors and students' personal dispositions should be considered in order to better understand the motivational dynamics at play in the transition to middle school.",

However, in the present study, students who were more mastery oriented during and after the middle school transition were slightly more anxious but also less depressed and inattentive at the end of elementary school than their less mastery-oriented peers. Furthermore, students who belonged to high performance-approach and avoidance-performance trajectories were more aggressive (performanceapproach) and anxious (performance-approach and performance-avoidance) in Grade 6. Attention problems also appeared to progressively orient the students, particularly girls, toward adopting performance-avoidance goals in secondary school. Whereas the role of anxiety in mastery goals orientation needs further investigation, interventions could target emotional dispositions such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and inattention so that school professionals can act proactively to foster appropriate goals and academic engagement at the beginning of secondary school. Thus, teachers in Grade 6 and Secondary 1 could play a critical role by being on the lookout for atypical behaviors in class, applying measures to deal with these problems, or referring students to the appropriate resources so that they could receive adequate support.",
