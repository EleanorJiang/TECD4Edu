    "abstract": "Background. Children's perceived competence and intrinsic motivation are assumed to be very high at the outset of schooling. However, how they change and how they relate to each other and to academic achievement across early schooling years remain open to question Aims. This 3-year longitudinal study was aimed at examining the following questions. Do children's perceived competence and intrinsic motivation about reading and mathematics change across the first 3 years of schooling? Do their perceived competence and intrinsic motivation differ according to academic domains? Do their perceived competence and intrinsic motivation relate to their academic achievement in each academic domain? Sample. A total of 115 elementary schoolchildren (63 boys and 52 girls) were examined in first grade (mean age = 84,5 months, SD = .67) and for the next 2 years. Method. Children responded to questionnaires about their perceived competence and intrinsic motivation in reading and mathematics. Year-end grades in these two subjects were used as a measure of performance. Results. Changes in perceived competence and intrinsic motivation, and between-year intercorrelations, were observed to differ according to academic domains and gender. Intrinsic motivation did not make a significant contribution to academic achievement at either school grade or in any academic domain, whereas perceived competence was significantly related to achievement at each school grade in both reading and mathematics. Conclusions. Differences between boys and girls observed in this study were not linked to a specific domain and cannot be attributed to gender-role stereotypes. Girls www.bps.org.uk",

According to Deci and Ryan (1992; Deci, Vallerand, Pelletier, & Ryan, 1991) , intrinsic motivation is strongly linked to the basic human need to feel competent. Moreover, empirical studies have confirmed that children's perceptions of competence are positively related to their intrinsic motivation (Boggiano, Main, & Katz, 1988; Gottfried, 1990; Harter, 1981 Harter, , 1992 . This led some authors to suggest that the development of perceptions of competence in a domain is necessary to develop and maintain intrinsic motivation in this same domain (Skaalvik & Rankin, 1995; Stipek, 1992) .",

Self-perceptions of competence are important because they affect students' cognitive and motivational functioning. Depending on a positive or negative appraisal of their capacities, students will take interest or not in what they are learning and, consequently, will make efforts or be passive in their work. When confronted with difficulties, students having a positive view of their capacities will be prone to persevere and eventually succeed whereas those who consider they have poor capacities will be likelier to abandon and fail (Assor & Connell, 1992; Bandura, 1986; Berry & West, 1993; Boggiano et al., 1988; Bouffard-Bouchard & Pinard, 1988; Entwisle, Alexander, Pallas, & Cadigan, 1987; Harter, 1990 Harter, , 1992 .

                "text": "It is important to stress that students' perceptions of competence do not necessarily reflect their real capacities. Studies have shown gifted students sometimes to have very negative self-perceptions and lower performances than their capacity level because of the maladjusted patterns of intellectual functioning these self-perceptions generate (Borkowski, Carr, Rellinger, & Pressley, 1990; Bouffard-Bouchard, Parent, & Lariv\u00e9e, 1990; Phillips, 1987; Phillips & Zimmerman, 1990) . With regard to young children, it is often argued that their appraisals of their intrinsic motivation and competence level are very high and exaggerated at the outset of schooling (Coster & Jaffe, 1990; Dweck, 1989; Flink, Boggiano, Main, Barrett, & Katz, 1992; Harter, 1981 Harter, , 1992 Paris & Byrnes, 1989; Stipek, 1984 Stipek, , 1992 . Very different reasons are invoked to explain such initial unrealistic optimism. For example, Ruble, Grosouvsky, Frey, and Cohen (1992) suggested that it could be due to the young children's tendency to make judgments consistent with desires. For Nicholls (1978 Nicholls ( , 1979 , because young children tend to equate effort with ability, having tried hard or mastered a task could lead them to feel smart and to positively evaluate their own abilities. Finally, according to Flammer (1995) , because teachers want to encourage kindergarten and preschool children, they usually give them feedback that is relatively arbitrary and positive.",

Marsh et al. (1991) reported linear decreases in children's selfperceptions of competence in various academic domains across elementary school years. Eccles et al. (1993) reported similar results in a study among grade one to four elementary schoolchildren (see also Stipek & Mac Iver, 1989 , for a review). The generality of this phenomenom led some authors to suggest that changes in cognitive processing abilities and in school environment as children get older are likely to be involved in this decline (Bouffard, Markovits, Vezeau, Boisvert, & Dumas, 1998; Stipek & Mac Iver, 1989) . So, with age and school experience children would become more able to use information from past performances and to differentiate their motivation and competence in different domains (Eder, 1990; Gottfried, 1990; Marsh et al., 1991; Wigfield et al., 1997) .",

The present 3-year longitudinal study was aimed at addressing the following questions. Do children's self-perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation about reading and mathematics change across the first 3 years of schooling? Do young elementary schoolchildren's self-perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation differ according to academic domains? Finally, do young elementary schoolchildren's self-perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation relate to their academic achievement in each academic domain?

This suggested to us that girls may be more inclined or more able to reconsider their initial self-perceptions and intrinsic motivation following early schooling experience. In order to document this explanation, we examined separately for boys and girls how self-perceptions and intrinsic motivation about each academic domain at grade two and three were related to year-end marks at the preceding year. As shown in Table 5 , both boys' and girls' intrinsic motivation at both grades was unrelated to the preceding year's end marks in either domain. However, girls' perceptions of competence about each domain were systematically related to their preceding year's end marks in the same domain, while for boys a relation was observed between self-perceptions of competence and preceding year's end marks but only in grade three in mathematics. Thus, as others already suggested, as children mature and gain more schooling experience, they tend to bring their selfperceptions into line with their actual performance (Chapman & Tunmer, 1995; Saarnio, Oka, & Paris, 1990; Stipek, 1984) .

As mentioned earlier, some authors affirm that first-grade children are already able to make such differentiation (Bordeleau & Bouffard, 1999; Eccles et al., 1993; Marsh et al., 1991 Marsh et al., , 1998 Wigfield & Harold, 1992; Wigfield et al., 1997) , whereas for others this ability emerges only around grade three (Harter, 1992; Harter & Pike, 1984; Paris & Byrnes, 1989) . Results of the present study support both positions. The only difference between academic domains among boys was their higher self-perceptions of competence in reading than in mathematics at grade one. In contrast, at every school grade girls reported different levels of selfperceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation for reading than for mathematics. In addition, between-academic domains relations of both self-perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation systematically decline across school level among girls whereas relations of boys' perceptions of competence between academic domains did not change and relations of intrinsic motivation in reading and mathematics went Table 5 . Correlation coefficients between self-perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation at grade two and three, and year-end marks at the preceding year for boys (n=63) and girls (n=52) up and down across school levels. These findings suggest that the controversy about the age at which children are able to make different judgments according to different academic domains may be linked to variability of gender representation in samples and to lack of consideration of gender differences in most studies examining this issue. However, in each academic domain and similarly for boys and girls, the relation between self-perceptions and intrinsic motivation increased across school level, supporting the view that children's self-perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation are feeding each other along school years (Skaalvik & Rankin, 1995; Stipek, 1992) . Finally, the last question examined in this study was how children's self-perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation about academic domains relate to their achievement in each domain. Not surprisingly, in first grade, little variance in academic achievement was explained, but in both domains only self-perceptions of competence were significantly related to children's year-end marks. At no school level in either reading or mathematics did intrinsic motivation or gender significantly contribute to explain variations in children's year-end marks. As could have been expected, within each academic domain, previous academic achievement accounted for a significant percentage of current academic achievement. However, self-perceptions of competence in academic domain systematically accounted for a significant percentage of the variance in year-end marks in the same domain. Although the absence of relation between intrinsic motivation and academic achievement seems to suggest that the latter is more dependent on positive self-perceptions than on the willingness to learn, this conclusion may be asserted with caution. At all school levels, self-perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation were related. Also, higher than self-perceptions, intrinsic motivation remained quite high across school levels and its variance was low. These may have concurred to reduce the likelihood of observing significant contribution of intrinsic motivation in academic achievement. In addition, even though intrinsic motivation is not directly related to academic achievement among young elementary schoolchildren, its importance may increase with school level Findings of this study support the contention made by Harter (1992) in arguing that how self-perceptions of competence and intrinsic motivation develop and evolve across young elementary schoolchildren is a phenomenon that cannot be generalised. We believe that factors such as gender and academic domains should be taken into account in addressing this issue. Gender differences in competence beliefs have often been reported. Favouring boys in mathematics and sports, and favouring girls in reading and social sciences, these gender differences have been interpreted as expressing cultural gender-role stereotypes (see Eccles, Wigfield, & Schifele, 1998 , for a review). Differences between boys and girls observed in this study were not linked to a specific domain and therefore cannot be attributed to gender-role stereotypes. They concerned lower between-year relations of perceived competence and intrinsic motivation, and earlier decrement in between-academic domain relations for girls than for boys. This pattern of results suggests that boys are earlier than girls in consolidating their self-system, whereas girls would be more precocious in differentiating their competence and intrinsic motivation according to academic domain. This would allow them to structure earlier than boys a self-system that is less global and more domain specific. This line of reasoning is consistent with the earlier interplay between academic achievement in a given domain at a given year and subsequent perceived competence in the same domain observed among girls. This suggests their earlier capacity than boys in processing and integrating information about their ability from past performances in the domain.",
