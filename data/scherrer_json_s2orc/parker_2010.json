The purpose of this study is to investigate young adolescents' perceptions of self prior to and during their middle grades years. Data were collected from 78 fifth grade students using the Piers Harris Self-Concept Scale beginning in the spring of their fifth grade year and continuing across multiple data points in middle school. Data analyses indicate that young adolescents initially experience positive changes in five of six domainspecific aspects of self-concept after the transition to middle school, followed by subsequent declines to mean ratings at or below their elementary school values.

Fresh from the nurturing elementary environment, young adolescents often find themselves navigating new relationships and making sense of the changing school norms associated with middle grades schools. In addition to environmental changes, young adolescents are also in the midst of dramatic physical and psychological growth (Rice & Dolgin, 2005) . Researchers suggest the academic, social, and emotional declines associated with the middle grades are the result of any number of factors including the myriad changes faced by young adolescents that coincide with the transition (Blyth, Simmons, & Carlton-Ford, 1983 ), a mismatch between students' developmental needs and the school environment (Eccles & Midgley, 1989) , and differences in motivational orientations of middle grades classrooms (Anderman & Midgley, 1997) .",

Researchers focus on self-concept because it is particularly vulnerable to change during early adolescence (Baldwin & Hoffmann, 2002) . Furthermore, it can be studied as both a holistic construct and in various domain-specific areas such as academic and physical self-concepts. This is important as domain-specific self-concepts can be tied to critical school outcomes including academic achievement, motivation, and behavior (Pajares & Schunk, 2001; Schunk, 2000) , and they become increasingly independent of each other during early adolescence (Harter, 2006) . Unfortunately, current research investigating young adolescents' selfconcepts in middle grades settings is limited and generally focuses on the brief period encompassing the time immediately before and after the transition to middle school. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore young adolescents' self-concepts in several specific domains prior to and across the middle grades. This study will update and enhance the existing literature on young adolescents' perceptions of self across these pivotal schooling years.",

Self-concept can be thought of as a multifaceted construct that is hierarchical in nature, with global self-concept at the top, and subcategories underneath that influence each other, as well as an individual's overall sense of self (Marsh, 1990; Shavelson & Bolus, 1982) . Examples of subcategories include academic, social, emotional, physical, and athletic perceptions of self. A subcategory such as academic self-concept may be further divided into subject-specific domains, such as math, science, reading, and social studies. These subject-specific self-concepts work together to inform an individual's overall sense of academic self-concept, which, in turn, is part of the larger global self-concept construct (Pajares & Schunk, 2001 ). Self-concept and self-esteem are often used interchangeably in the research literature (Strein, 1995) . Self-esteem, however, is a subcategory of selfconcept that enables a person to establish a sense of value or self-worth (Rice, & Dolgin, 2005; Schunk) .",

With growth and maturity, a child's self-concept gradually increases in complexity until, eventually, they begin to organize perceptions of their abilities (Rice & Dolgin, 2005; Schunk, 2000) . An individual's global perceptions of self are fairly stable; however, domain-specific self-concepts can be influenced by self-assessments, idealizations, contextual experiences, and evaluations by significant others, such as parents, peers, and role models (Shavelson & Bolus, 1982) . This susceptibility to influence is particularly prevalent during puberty, as young adolescents begin making thorough evaluations of themselves and their abilities through both self-assessments and intense social comparisons (Rice & Dolgin). As a result, young adolescents' domain-specific self-concepts, particularly in terms of intelligence, social skills, and athletics, are more fluid and open to both positive and negative influences (Rice & Dolgin; Schunk).",

Some researchers found general declines in global self-concept for young adolescents transitioning into the middle grades Seidman, Allen, Aber, Mitchell, & Feinman, 1994; Simmons, Burgerson, Carlton-Ford, & Blyth, 1987; Zanobini & Usai) , with self-concept reaching its lowest points immediately after the transition (Eccles et al.) . Researchers indicated that these declines in global self-concept may be a function of contextual changes, the onset of puberty, and increasingly accurate self-analyses of abilities (Eccles et al.; Simmons et al.; Zanobini & Usai) . In contrast, others researchers noted that young adolescents' self-concepts remain stable or increase as they enter middle school (Barber & Olsen, 2004; Chung, Elias, & Schneider, 1998; Parker & Neuharth-Pritchett, 2006) . Timing of the data collection in the spring of the transition year, as opposed to immediately after the transition, (Chung et al.) and contextual factors such as the use of team structures and advisory (Barber & Olsen; Parker & Neuharth-Pritchett) may be factors influencing these results. Interestingly, Barber and Olsen found that young adolescents' selfconcepts declined when they entered seventh grade, even though it was not located in a new school. The researchers hypothesized that a change from more personalized family pods to a departmentalized junior high school environment may have negatively influenced students' global self-concepts.",

It is during this reevaluation period that young adolescents may be unusually susceptible to potentially positive and negative influences on their academic self-concept. For example, students may determine that they are more competent, similarly competent, or less competent than in their previous school context Harter et al., 1992) .

Middle grades environments are typically characterized by an increased emphasis on grades and products as compared to elementary classrooms. This move to learning driven by extrinsic factors can lead to decreases in students' motivation for learning (Eccles & Midgley; Harter et al.) . Academic selfcompetence and motivation may also be influenced by how students perceive the goal orientation of their middle grades classrooms. Anderman and Midgley (1997) found that declines in academic selfconcept were generally associated with students who experienced achievement goal (grade driven) rather than mastery goal (learning driven) classrooms.

Social self-concept is defined as how one perceives their \"social competence with respect to social interactions with others\" (Byrne & Shavelson, 1996, p. 601) . Social self-concept is a key construct, in that it impacts adolescents' interactions with peers and teachers, their approach to conflict resolution, and their acclimation to the classroom social environment (Peetsma, Hasher, van der Veen, & Roede, 2005) . Students' sense of social self-concept is influenced by the social context of the middle grades environment. Researchers suggested that young adolescents see negative shifts in their social environment, possibly the result of a disconnect between their developmental needs and the perceived environment (Midgley & Feldlaufer, 1987; Oldfather & McLaughlin, 1993; Seidman et al., 1994) . Furthermore, young adolescents described negative shifts in decision-making opportunities, increases in teacher control, and decreases in teacher support (Midgley & Feldlaufer; Seidman et al.) . It may be that teachers convey messages to students about their behaviors, physical development, and academic abilities that set expectations for the students and inform their social self-concepts (Good & Brophy, 1995; Roesser & Eccles, 1998) . These contextual characteristics subsequently inform young adolescent peer relationships, status among peers, motivational levels, and overall happiness with school.",

Discussions of emotional selfconcept in the literature are centered on students' descriptions of anxiety, hassle, and depression. Symptoms of depression and poor self-concept appear to go hand-in-hand (Harter, 1999) . In their research on adolescents exhibiting symptoms of depression, Field, Diego, and Sanders (2001) noted that depressed adolescents experienced significantly less happiness, poorer peer relationships, and lower grade point averages than their non-depressed peers. Chung and colleagues (1998) found that psychological distress increased, regardless of gender, as students entered middle school. Barber and Olsen (2004) also noted higher levels of depression in young adolescents following the move from sixth to seventh grade; however, an initial decrease in depression immediately after the transition to middle school (sixth grade) preceded this increase. They suggested that changes in the social context of school (from smaller teams to departmentalized structures) may have challenged students' existing emotional self-concepts.",

In terms of gender, research revealed that females report lower perceptions of their physical appearance and abilities than males during adolescence (Harter, 1988; O'Dea & Abraham, 1999) . For some adolescents, the timing of the onset of puberty may be a key factor in their physical self-perceptions. Researchers suggested that the early onset of puberty in males actually increased in their physical self-perceptions; however, females who entered puberty early experience decreased physical self-concepts (Folk, Pedersen, & Cullari, 1993) . Understanding the role of physical selfconcept is vital, given the influence perceptions of attractiveness have on both males' and females' overall sense of worth (Hay & Ashman, 2003) .",

These include teaming, common planning time, advisory, and transition programming (Jackson & Davis; National Middle School Association [NMSA], 2003) . At Windsor Middle School, teachers at all grade levels are organized into three-or fourperson instructional teams, and all students are subsequently assigned to one of these teams. All students attend connections classes such as art, music, band, and technology in addition to their academic classes. Teachers assigned to a team have common planning time to facilitate academic planning, student support, and parent communications (Jackson & Davis; NMSA) . Windsor Middle School uses bi-monthly advisory meetings for the purposes of developing student-teacher relationships and providing all students with an advocate in the school. Finally, Windsor Middle School makes a concerted effort to address school transitions proactively. All fifth graders transitioning into Windsor Middle are visited by the middle school guidance counselor, take a structured field trip to the middle school, ask questions of middle school students, and attend open house nights at the middle school.",

Participation was voluntary, and students received a small incentive (candy) for their involvement. Data were collected from participants in May of their fifth grade year, October and May of their sixth grade year, and October of their seventh grade year. It should be noted that participants in this study began each new school year in early August and, therefore, had been in school for two full months prior to the October data collection point. The following year, the researcher added an additional group of 32 fifth graders to the study, and data were also collected from these participants in May of their fifth grade year, October and May of their sixth grade year, and October of their seventh grade year. Comparisons of these two cohorts did not suggest significant differences between the groups in terms of race (x 2 (4) = 2.67; p = 0.61) or gender (x 2 (1) = 3.28; p = 0.07), and the year cohorts did not differ from one another on their perceptions of self-concept at fifth grade (see Table 3 ). As a result, the data were collapsed into one sample group for all remaining analyses in this longitudinal study (Parker & Neuharth-Pritchett, 2006) . The researcher administered the surveys in all instances. Prior to distributing the survey, the researcher discussed the purpose of the study and reminded students that there were no wrong answers, their honesty was important, and their responses were confidential. As the students completed their responses to the surveys independently, the researcher monitored their progress and double-checked their scoring forms to ensure there was no missing data. Participants completed the entire data collection process in less than one hour, with some students finishing in 30 minutes. The researcher repeated the process for each data collection point. While repeated use of the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale may threaten internal validity, the time between data collection points ameliorated this concern.",

Data indicate a significant increase in perceptions of intellect and school status as students began the middle grades (F = 32.19, p = 0, \u03b7 = 0.30). The initial increase is contrary to the typical declines in academic achievement and perceived academic competence associated with the transition to middle school (Barber & Olsen, 2004; Shapka & Keating, 2005) . The adolescents in this study did experience declines in their academic self-concepts, however, these occurred as they moved through sixth grade and into seventh grade (F = 12.95, p = 0, \u03b7 = 0.34). The effect sizes calculated for the time effect suggest a significant difference in adolescents' perceptions of intellectual and school status as they progressed through the middle grades. The guidelines for Cohen's D indicate that the magnitude of this difference is small. It may be hypothesized that the academic environment, which included the use of homogeneous teams and the existence of routine academic awards assemblies, contributed to the diminishing perceptions of intellectual and school status. In other words, because the academic environment created multiple opportunities for adolescents to make peer comparisons and interpret teachers' perceptions of their own academic abilities (Rice & Dolgin, 2005) , academic selfperceptions may have been negatively influenced (Eccles & Midgley, 1989; Harter et al., 1992 ).",

Repeated measures tests reveal significant increases in behavioral selfconcept across the transition from fifth into sixth grade (F = 32.92, p = 0, \u03b7 = 0.30). In contrast, young adolescents' behavioral self-concepts significantly decreased during the latter part of sixth grade and into the seventh grade year (F = 11.27, p = 0, \u03b7 = 0.31). While the research literature suggests adolescents experience negative shifts in their social self-concepts during middle school (Oldfather & McLaughlin, 1993; Seidman, et al., 1994) , data from this study indicate initially positive perceptions of their behavior. The initial increase may be the result of expectations conveyed to students in the transition program. This program may have raised student awareness of behavioral expectations prior to entering the middle grades, thus having a positive initial influence on their social self-perceptions. As they progressed through middle school, trends in behavior returned to their pre-transition levels, with the delayed declines reflective of traditional trends in the literature. (Harter, 1988; Kenny & McEachern, 2009; Seidman et al.) . As these students continued through middle school, it may be hypothesized that the novelty of a new school environment eroded, prompting behavior to return to pre-transition levels.",

These findings are contrary to the majority of the literature that reports negative shifts in academic, social, and emotional self-perceptions immediately after the transition to middle school Seidman et al., 1994; Zanobini & Usai, 2002) . The young adolescents in this study were not immune to negative shifts in domain-specific categories of self-concept; rather, they experienced these shifts at the end of sixth grade and at the beginning of seventh grade. These declines in the midst of the middle grades experience are troubling, especially given their initially positive self-perceptions across the transition. Perhaps the presence of the transition program and a school context that uses several structural tenets recommended in Turning Points 2000 (Jackson & Davis, 2000) contributed positively to young adolescents' developing sense of self as they move from elementary to middle grades schools in this study, but this is only speculation until future research is conducted.",

First and foremost, the sample size was greatly influenced by student transience in this particular school district. The small sample size limits the generalizability of these findings; however, this work may serve as an impetus for development of future studies. Furthermore, the issue of sample size is ameliorated, to a degree, by the inclusion of effect sizes in the results. While the lack of a control group is also a limitation of this study, denying young adolescents access to transition support and organizational structures such as teaming and advisory may have increased the potential for negative long-term outcomes.",

It is critical for middle grades educators to be aware of the tenuous nature of young adolescents' perceptions of self and the role they may play in positively or negatively influencing these various domain-specific self-concepts. The findings from this study suggest initially positive shifts in domain-specific self-concepts across the transition to middle grades. While these results are promising, the subsequent declines as students move through the middle grades are cause for concern and must be explored through future research.",
