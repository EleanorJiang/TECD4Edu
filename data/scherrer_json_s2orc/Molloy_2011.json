    "abstract": "This study uses intraindividual variability and change methods to test theoretical accounts of self-concept and its change across time and context and to test the developmental implications of this variability. The 5-year longitudinal study of 541 youths in a rural Pennsylvania community from 3rd through 7th grade included twice-yearly assessments of self-concept (academic and social), corresponding external evaluations of competence (e.g., teacher-rated academic skills, peer-nominated \"likeability\"), and multiple measures of youths' overall adjustment. Multiphase growth models replicate previous research, suggesting significant decline in academic self-concept during middle school but modest growth in social self-concept from 3rd through 7th grade. Next, a new contribution is made to the literature by quantifying the amount of within-subject variability (i.e., \"lability\") around these linear self-concept trajectories as a between-subjects characteristic. Self-concept lability was found to associate with a general profile of poorer competence and adjustment and to predict poorer academic and social competence at the end of 7th grade above and beyond level of self-concept. Finally, there was substantial evidence that wave-towave changes in youths' self-concepts correspond to teacher and peer evaluations of youths' competence, that attention to peer feedback may be particularly strong during middle school, and that these relations may be moderated by between-subjects indicators of youths' general adjustment. Overall, findings highlight the utility of methods sensitive to within-subject variation for clarifying the dynamics of youths' self-system development.",

                "text": "The development of self-cognitions in childhood and adolescence is of enduring interest to developmental scientists because of their key role in motivational structures and behavioral choices (e.g., Bandura, 1997; Deci & Ryan, 2000) . Existing studies have often focused on the development of self-concept in terms of increasing cognitive capacities or normative trajectories (e.g., Dweck, 2002; Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, & Wigfield, 2002 ). Yet theoretical accounts of self-concept formation suggest that, beyond average trajectories, self-concept may also fluctuate. For instance, multiple theories of self-concept posit that individuals incorporate others' evaluations of them into their own self-views, suggesting potential for within-subject variability across time and contexts and between-subjects differences in this self-other correspondence (e.g., Cairns & Cairns, 1988; Cooley, 1922) . Although some studies have examined predictors of short-term changes in self-concept (e.g., Gest, Rulison, Davidson, & Welsh, 2008) , few have taken advantage of analytic methods sensitive to fluctuations across multiple measurement occasions. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated in several domains (e.g., cognition, affect, self-esteem) that quantification and study of the amount or structure of within-subject variability provides a more complete picture of individuals' development (Nesselroade, 1991; Ram & Gerstorf, 2009) . The purpose of this study is to delve into the developmental implications of within-subject variability in self-concept by matching theories of self-concept and its potential to change across time and context to analytic methods that are sensitive to such changes. In this study, we examine long-term trends in academic and social self-concepts from elementary to middle school, explore correlates and consequences of the amount of within-subject variability around these trends, and identify attributes of youths and their environment that may account for fluctuations in self-concept.",

Academic selfconcept is critical in the development of academic motivation, contributing to school-related values, expectations, and achievement (e.g., Guay, Marsh, & Boivin, 2003) . Social self-concept plays important roles in youths' social skill development, social status, peer affiliations, and several internalizing and externalizing symptoms (e.g., Hawley, 2003; Prinstein & La Greca, 2002) . More broadly, as youths undergo major developmental and environmental transitions associated with early adolescence, academic and social self-cognitions are important in guiding the paths upon which youths embark (e.g., Bandura, 1997; Deci & Ryan, 2000) .",

Such changes are generally explained by increased cognitive abilities leading to increasingly realistic (and less idealistic) self-views (e.g., Dweck, 2002) . Yet declines in self-concept may be especially pronounced during the transition to middle school, as several studies have demonstrated using piecewise linear growth curves (e.g., Midgley, Feldlaufer, & Eccles, 1989; Wigfield, Eccles, Mac Iver, Reuman, & Midgley, 1991) . The transition to middle school frequently involves a shift in instructional practices that are mismatched to early adolescents' developmental needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness (Connell & Wellborn, 1991; Eccles et al., 1993) . Middle school introduces harsher evaluative feedback, less teacher support, and greater focus on performance goals rather than mastery, in turn breeding unfavorable social comparisons and poor motivation, engagement, and learning. These contrasts to elementary school are seen as key sources of the decline in self-concept during middle school (e.g., Mac Iver, Young, & Washburn, 2002; Urdan & Midgley, 2003) .",

Given that level of self-concept tends to demonstrate reciprocal relations with actual performance and external feedback (e.g., Guay et al., 2003) , an important question is raised about the meaning of lability in self-concept for performance and feedback. One study by Amorose (2001) found that lability in physical self-concept negatively predicted motivation toward physical activity. Similarly, day-to-day academic selfconcept lability has predicted lower grades a year later (Tsai, 2008) . Based upon these and related findings, it has been suggested that high lability (in the self-system and other domains) may be a marker of high vulnerability or reactivity to stressors, while stability may indicate resilience or robustness (e.g., Greve & Enzmann, 2003; Waschull & Kernis, 1996) .",

Alternatively, high levels of lability may derive from the environment in which a child's self-views are developing. For instance, middle school introduces major shifts in the sources of external feedback and support, including a grade-level peer network instead of classroom-level and interaction with multiple teachers per day instead of just one (e.g., Feldlaufer, Midgley, & Eccles, 1988) .

For instance, inconsistent self-concepts may make it difficult for youths to form sound, realistic expectations of what challenges they can handle or how to do so. Similarly, to the extent that labile self-concepts correspond to or reflect actual fluctuations in youths' engagement, interest, and performance (Deci & Ryan, 1995; Harter, 1999) , these various levels of cognitive, affective, and behavioral inconsistency may impede long-term skill development (Kernis, 2003) .

In other words, self-concept fluctuations may result from inconsistency across time or context in the external feedback that youths receive about their academic and social competence. This process may be particularly relevant during early adoles-cence: The cognitive capacity to incorporate others' perceptions into one's own self-concept develops at this time and coincides with a developmental peak in youths' concerns about how they are perceived (Bukowski, Sippola, & Newcomb, 2000; Dweck, 2002) . Consistent with this notion, the majority of an adolescent sample in a study by Harter (1999) reported using a looking-glass-self orientation. From a developmental perspective, then, self-other correspondence that results from the incorporation of others' views into one's self-concept is particularly likely as youths begin adolescence.",

Similarly, in other studies, changes in social self-concept have been predicted by teacher or parent ratings of youths' social competence and peer acceptance, as well as by indices of \"likeability\" and \"social prominence\" created from peers' reports of which classmates they like and dislike (Cillessen & Bellmore, 1999; Cole, 1991) . The latter approach is viewed as the most ecologically valid assessment of youths' social status: Likeability, or social preference, refers to the frequency of \"liking nominations\" relative to the frequency of \"disliking\" nominations, and social prominence, or social impact, represents the degree to which a child elicits strong reactions from peers, whether positive or negative (e.g., Coie, Dodge, & Coppotelli, 1982) . These two key status dimensions have each been uniquely related to social self-concept (e.g., Newcomb & Bukowski, 1983; Lease, Musgrove, & Axelrod, 2002) .",

For instance, longstanding theories of achievement motivation and supporting evidence suggest that academic self-concept predicts achievement in school through its effects on youths' values and self-expectations. When youths have low expectations for success, they are less likely to pursue challenges that may help to improve their skills (e.g., Deci & Ryan, 1995; Eccles et al., 1983) ; in turn, skill development may suffer, as do teacher and peer perceptions of youths' skill level (Guay et al., 2003) . Moreover, the normative grading systems typical of middle school heighten youths' awareness of how they measure up to their peers (e.g., Eccles et al., 1993; Mac Iver et al., 2002) . To the extent that low self-concept manifests in youths' behaviors, peer perceptions of youths' competence are especially likely to match up with youths' self-concepts during this period. The power of self-concept to shape effort, achievement, and external feedback, then, provides another reason to expect covariation of these constructs over time. In sum, we expect self-other correspondence, likely resulting from bidirectional feedback loops between self-concept and observed competence, especially during middle school.",

Self-concept may manifest to varying degrees in observable behaviors, and evaluative feedback is filtered through potentially biased perceptions of that feedback (e.g., Harter, 1999; John & Robins, 1994) . One such bias is referred to as \"contingent\" self-esteem, in which youths' self-worth is highly dependent upon external validation (Crocker & Knight, 2005) . Contingent selfesteem involves heightened sensitivity to feedback and a tendency to perceive feedback as inconsistent; the result is more unstable self-views, avoidance of challenges, and poorer mental health (e.g., Deci & Ryan, 1995; Kernis, 2003) . In other words, youths with this type of bias may be especially prone to self-concept lability and strong self-other correspondence. Alternatively, some youths may simply perceive others' reactions to them through consistently positive or negative lenses.",

Similarly, depression, attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other mental health problems are frequently linked to biased and/or more labile selfviews, which are likely to affect both the impact of external feedback on self-concept and the ways others perceive and react to them (e.g., Hoza et al., 2004; Ward, Sylva, & Gresham, 2010) .

First, do youths, on average, experience a decline in self-concept over the middle school transition? Replicating previous research, we expected a linear decline in academic and social self-concepts directly following entry to middle school. Second, does self-concept lability differ between elementary and middle school, and does it relate to youths' academic and social adjustment and overall mental health? We expected that selfconcept lability would be greater following the transition to middle school. Further, we expected greater lability to be associated with a profile of poorer academic, social, and overall adjustment and for self-concept lability to be uniquely predictive of lower competence in seventh grade. Third, do short-term fluctuations in self-concept correspond with fluctuations in teacher and peer evaluations, and is self-other correspondence moderated by school level (elementary vs. middle school) and between-subjects differences? We expected self-other correspondence to be strongest during middle school and to be moderated by gender and \"proxies\" of mental health, including self-worth, loneliness, poor attention, victimization, and aggression.",

Items formed internally consistent composite scales within each wave. 1 The four statements corresponding to academic self-concept were \"Feel very good at my school work,\" \"Feel just as smart as other kids my age,\" \"Almost always figure out the answers,\" and \"Do very well in my class work\" (M \u03ed 3.04 -3.19 on the 1-4 scale; \u2423 \u03ed .57-.85).

Good reliability (internal consistency and stability) and convergent and discriminant validity of this expanded version of the scale were demonstrated in our previous examination of the measure (see Gest et al., 2005) .

In middle school, assessments were accompanied by a grade-level roster instead of a class roster, because students change classes throughout the day. Each item was standardized within classroom (or grade level in middle school) and gender to account for varying peer network size and sex distribution; nominations thus represented each student's relative standing in his or her peer network, allowing comparisons across classrooms and grade levels (see Coie et al., 1982; Gest et al., 2005) .",

Following standard practice (see Coie et al., 1982) , standardized peer nominations were used to compute two indices of social status. Social preference scores were calculated as the difference between the standardized \"like most\" and \"like least\" scores, representing how well liked a student was overall (e.g., do positive nominations outnumber negative?). To also account for the difference between neglected youths (i.e., no nominations of liking or disliking) and controversial youths (i.e., many nominations of each type), we also computed social impact scores as the sum of standardized \"like most\" and \"like least\" scores, to represent youths' prominence in their networks. While raw nominations of one type (i.e., liking or disliking) cannot be usefully interpreted without the other, each composite score represents a conceptually meaningful and distinct aspect of social experience. Moreover, computing composite peer scores from oppositely highly skewed \"like most\" and \"like least\" scores produces indices that are relatively normally distributed and thus conform well to standard assumptions of most analyses. Social preference scores ranged from -9.36 to 4.36, and social impact scores ranged from -3.15 to 7.71; both, by definition, had a mean score of 0.",

Consistent with our hypotheses, greater lability in academic self-concept was associated with overall lower academic adjustment: mean academic self-concept (r \u03ed -.20, p \u03fd .001), mean teacher-rated skills (r \u03ed -.17, p \u03fd .001), and mean PAR (r \u03ed -.22, p \u03fd .001).

Therefore, staying conservative, we limited the statistical test to students with no more than four occasions of data in elementary school to match the maximum number of data points available in middle school. Consistent with our operationalization of lability elsewhere in the article, we also limited the statistical tests to students who provided no less than three data points during elementary and middle school. associated with lower mean social self-concept (r \u03ed -.28, p \u03fd .001), teacher-rated social engagement (r \u03ed -.13, p \u03fd .001), and social preference (r \u03ed -.21, p \u03fd .001) and with lower self-worth (r \u03ed -.22, p \u03fd .001), poorer attention (r \u03ed -.10, p \u03fd .05), and higher levels of loneliness (r \u03ed .24, p \u03fd .001) and peer victimization (r \u03ed .15, p \u03fd .01). 5 Overall, as hypothesized, greater self-concept lability was associated with a profile of poorer adjustment.",

Specifically, overall scores for teacher-rated academic skills and social engagement, as well as peer nomination-based PAR, social preference, and social impact, were computed as youths' intraindividual means across assessments and were centered at the sample means. Occasionspecific scores were then computed as individuals' deviations from their own mean (once again centered at the sample mean). Overall scores were also computed for self-worth, loneliness, attention, victimization, and teacher and peer evaluations of aggressive behavior.",

As hypothesized, results suggest that, on average, academic self-concept covaried significantly as a function of occasion-specific teacher ratings (\u2425 40 \u03ed 0.08, p \u03fd .001). Also consistent with hypotheses, covariation between academic self-concept and occasion-specific PAR was significantly Figure 3 ). In addition, the correspondence between PAR and academic selfconcept was weakly but significantly moderated by overall teacher-rated academic skills (\u2425 51 \u03ed 0.07, p \u03fd .01) and attention (\u2425 53 \u03ed -0.05, p \u03fd .05). The former interaction suggests that highly academically skilled (but not lower skilled) youths experience a boost in academic self-concept on occasions when they have a high PAR. The latter interaction suggests that covariation between academic self-concept and PAR is strongest among youths with attention problems. In sum, self-peer correspondence emerges during middle school and is more prominent for some youths than others, while self-teacher correspondence is a relatively consistent phenomenon. Similarly, as hypothesized, social self-concept significantly covaried with occasion-specific social preference (\u2425 40 \u03ed 0.05, p \u03fd .001), and among youths high in self-worth, social self-concept covaried with occasion-specific social engagement (\u2425 34 \u03ed 0.08, p \u03fd .05). Also consistent with hypotheses, occasion-specific social impact positively related to social self-concept only during middle school (\u2425 60 \u03ed 0.04, p \u03fd .05; see bottom of Figure 3 ). An interaction between occasion-specific social impact and overall social preference (\u2425 52 \u03ed -0.03, p \u03fd .01) suggests that youths who tend to be low on social preference experience a boost in self-concept on occasions when they are also high on social impact, but this relation is reversed among youths high in social preference. Last, the difference in social self-concept between victimized and nonvictimized youths appears to be greater on occasions when youths are high in social impact than when they are low in social impact (\u2425 57 \u03ed -0.04, p \u03fd .05). A significant random effect for occasionspecific social preference (u 4i \u03ed .01, p \u03fd .05) suggests that there remain unaccounted-for between-subjects differences in the covariation between social self-concept and social preference. A visual, conceptual example of how significant between-subjects differ- ences manifest in the data is shown in Figure 4 . The individual in the Panel A is characterized by high self-other correspondence (i.e., covariation), and the individual in Panel B is characterized by low self-other correspondence. Overall, results of these final models suggest that self-concepts are more likely to accurately reflect external evaluations among well-adjusted youths.",

In the present study, we extend previous research by focusing attention on the within-subject variability around youths' linear trajectories of academic and social selfconcept development from third through seventh grades-a concept that has received little attention in the literature thus far. We began by replicating developmental trajectories identified in previous studies: We found, on average, a modest but significant decline in academic self-concept during middle school. The average developmental growth trend for social self-concept, on the other hand, slowly increased across time with no apparent deflection at the middle school transition. We then made a new contri-bution to the literature by quantifying the amount of within-subject variability around individuals' linear trajectories-self-concept lability. Results did not substantiate the expected increase in lability during middle school. Consistent with hypotheses, however, greater academic and social self-concept lability was associated with a general profile of poorer competence and several \"proxies\" of poorer mental health. We also demonstrated the unique predictive utility of self-concept lability scores: Between-subjects differences in academic and social \"success\" at the end of seventh grade were negatively predicted by between-subjects differences in the respective domains of self-concept lability, even after accounting for mean self-concept. We additionally examined the withinsubject covariation over time between self-concept and others' perceptions of youths' competence-selfother correspondence. In line with expectations, self-peer correspondence across both competence domains was strongest during middle school, while self-teacher correspondence appeared to be relatively consistent over time. Finally, moderation by several between-subjects differences suggests that self-other correspondence may be weaker among youths with poorer mental health. Representation of significant between-subjects differences in covariation between social self-concept and peer-nominated social preference across the fall of third grade through spring of seventh grade. One example of a child whose social self-concept strongly covaries with his or her social preference score over time is seen in Panel A, and one child whose social self-concept does not covary with his or her social preference score over time is seen in Panel B. Figure 3 . Academic self-concept (Panel A) and social self-concept (Panel B) as a function of peer-nomination-based scores (peer academic reputation in Panel A and social impact in Panel B). Both graphs demonstrate significantly stronger within-subject covariation between peer nomination scores and self-concept during middle school (with little to no covariation evident in elementary school). The findings represented by these graphs are consistent with the idea that features of the middle school environment may heighten youths' awareness of and sensitivity to how they \"measure up\" to their peers and how their peers perceive them.",

Consistent with the existing literature (e.g., Midgley et al., 1989; Wigfield et al., 1991) , the present study indicates a shift from a relatively flat trend in academic self-concept across elementary school to a slight downward trend during middle school. As noted earlier, middle school can present a stark contrast to elementary school, with sudden shifts in teaching practices and educational climate that fit poorly with early adolescents' developmental needs, tending to undermine motivation, learning, and self-concept (e.g., Connell & Wellborn, 1991; Feldlaufer et al., 1988) . Contrary to hypotheses, we found, on average, a modest increase in social self-concept across waves. Possible explanations include the fact that the items used to assess and track changes in social selfconcept in the present study prompt children to consider how many friends they have and how easy it is to make friends (Harter, 1982) . Perhaps youths are better able to make friends as the pool of potential friends grows to an entire grade cohort in middle school.",

One explanation for this result may be that self-concept lability reflects some type of psychological or environmental turmoil (e.g., Crocker & Knight, 2005) . For instance, youths with depressive symptoms (e.g., low self-worth) may be prone to doubting and recalibrating their self-concepts each time they are faced with new evaluative feedback; as such, recent successes or failures (e.g., a test grade) may tend to override previous demonstrations of ability. Similarly, certain behavioral problems such as aggression may elicit inconsistent feedback from peers (i.e., reinforcement by some but disliking from others), while youths with attention problems may struggle to maintain consistency in academic performance. These are just a few examples of ways in which poor mental health may generate a labile self-concept. More research will be needed to clarify the mechanisms that explain the relations observed in the present study and to consider additional explanations for the observed lability. For instance, future research should consider features of youths' environment-such as an unstable home life or school climate or changes over time in social and instrumental support from teachers and parents-that may account for some lability.",

Our findings that self-concept instability across the elementary and middle school years predicted lower competence at the end of seventh grade are consistent with similar research (e.g., Tsai, 2008; Waschull & Kernis, 1996) in suggesting that self-concept lability may temporally precede poorer competence. A labile self-concept translates to a lack of coherent, realistic, or self-assured views of one's abilities and what challenges one can handle effectively. As such, a labile self-concept may lead to inconsistent effort and avoidance of the challenges needed to build academic or social skills; longer term development of skills and problem-solving strategies are thus likely to suffer (Deci & Ryan, 1995; Kernis, 2003) . More broadly, the present findings highlight the usefulness and importance of considering both level and lability as both cause and consequence in future examinations of self-concept and its relation to other constructs.",

The present study strengthens this evidence by establishing relations at the within-subject level and across both academic and social domains of competence (e.g., Cillessen & Bellmore, 1999; Denissen, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2007) . On average, youths reported an academic self-concept above or below their own average at waves when teachers' ratings of their academic skills were also above or below their own average. Similarly, semester-to-semester changes in social self-concept tracked occasion-specific levels of social preference. The present analyses do not allow us to determine the causal directionality of the relations between self-concepts and external feedback, but past research has suggested that the self-other correspondence observed in the present study is likely bidirectional. Self-concept has been found to be an important determinant of youths' effort and achievement in a particular domain and of how others will perceive them (e.g., Eccles et al., 1983; Guay et al., 2003) . Conversely, past achievement and feedback experiences are believed to form the basis of youths' self-concepts. A common theme across theories of self-concept has been the idea of a looking-glass self: Individuals see themselves the way they believe others see them (Cairns & Cairns, 1988; Cooley, 1922; James, 1890) . This process may be particularly relevant during early adolescence, which marks a developmental peak in youths' interest in and anxiety about what peers think of them and a development of the cognitive capacity to accurately assess and incorporate external evaluations into self-views (Bukowski et al., 2000; Dweck, 2002) .",

Similarly, environmental factors are likely to influence levels of self-concept, achievement, and their covariation. The quality of relationships with peers, parents, or teachers (e.g., parents' disciplinary tendencies), teaching practices (e.g., opportunities for active learning, harsh grading), and school climate (e.g., students' feelings of safety and support in the school) are just a few examples of important factors likely to affect youths' social and academic development.

For instance, youths may place particularly high value on particular evaluations, or tend to view evaluative information through a consistently negative lens (e.g., Crocker & Knight, 2005; John & Robins, 1994) . The present study can be interpreted as further substantiating these ideas, providing evidence for several between-subject moderators of self-other correspondence. For instance, an interaction of occasion-specific social impact with overall social preference suggests that strong peer reactions-even when negative-are more beneficial to social self-concept than neglect (i.e., a lack of peer attention). In contrast, high social impact among well-liked youths appears to be \"harmful\"; this is consistent with some evidence suggesting that being highly prominent or \"popular\" in one's social network tends to elicit strong reactions from peers, both positive and negative (e.g., de Bruyn & Cillessen, 2010) . Moreover, the present findings suggest an important role of mental health. Within-subject relations between academic self-concept and PAR were stronger among youths with attention problems, but these youths tended, on average, to have less \"accurate\" self-perceptions of their academic skills (as rated by teachers). The within-subject correspondence between teacher ratings of social engagement and social self-concept was weaker among youths with low self-worth, and occasion-specific social impact seemed to have little effect on the low overall social self-concepts of victimized youths. Taken together, these findings suggest that poorly adjusted youths tend to have less \"accurate\" self-views, which in some cases may be negatively biased.",

The longitudinal design with high participation rates and low attrition, allowed us to examine developmental processes; and the relatively large number of assessments (up to 10 occasions) allowed us to go beyond the usual between-subject investigations. The present study thus strengthens results from previous research, demonstrating these relations within-subject with stricter tests that control for betweensubject differences. Moreover, this study is among the first to apply within-subject variability methods (Ram & Gerstorf, 2009) to the study of youths' self-concept and to examine domainspecific self-concept lability in relation to corresponding domains of competence. Within-subject variability methods are typically applied to data collected at much faster time scales (i.e., multiple assessments obtained over minutes or days). Here, we extend previous work by applying this method to a period of months and years, reaching conclusions similar to those of other studies: greater lability is associated with poorer adjustment. These findings are unique in drawing attention to individual differences in youths' characteristic amount of lability around their longer-term self-concept trajectories, and highlighting self-concept lability as an important phenomenon worth continued consideration.",

                "text": "Some aspects of the initial design of the study limited our ability to fully capture within-subject variability and potential correlates. For instance, the procedures used to obtain \"peer evaluations of competence\" required a shift in measurement from elementary classroom-level nominations to middle school grade-level nominations. Although this shift in measurement conceptually matches the actual shift in size of youths' \"peer network\" as they move into middle school, it raises concerns faced by many measures in developmental research as to whether the meaning of the measure remains consistent across this transition. Further, self-concept development is known to vary substantially across domains (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2002) , including variations across specific school subjects (e.g., math, reading), but only the broad measures were available here. Future work should examine if and how more fine-grained domains of self-concept lability are related, and/or are coupled to other factors. It is likely that occasion-specific changes in self-concept and the tendency for a youth's self-concept to be particularly labile could be more thoroughly explained by numerous individual and environmental variables to which we did not have access in the present data set. For instance, other individual differences (e.g., personality or more direct indices of mental health), relatively temporary developmental phases (e.g., level of a youth's physical or psychological maturation), and multiple features of the environment in which a child's self-views are developing (e.g., the stability of youths' home lives or school climate, consistency of support from teachers and parents, or significant life events such as parents' divorce) would undoubtedly help to account for some of the within-and between-subject variability observed in this study.",

Self-concept lability may be largely a product of youths' environments (e.g., inconsistent teaching practices), it may represent an enduring characteristic of an individual (e.g., sensitivity to external events), or it may reflect a more temporary phase of development (e.g., late pubertal timing). To this end, a person-centered approach may be a useful future step, allowing us to identify \"profiles\" of youths who are more labile or more stable. For instance, a latent profile analysis could help us to pin down the risk factors associated with self-concept lability. Perhaps labile youths are consistently characterized by low self-esteem, internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), or behavior problems; or perhaps external stressors such as a chaotic home life or low socioeconomic status are the primary variables that distinguish labile youths from more stable youths. Our use of mental health \"proxy\" variables was a valuable first step in this direction, but more direct indices of mental health and environmental risk factors as well as focused person-oriented analyses will be needed to gain a clear picture of who these more labile youths are.",

The timescale over which youths' self-concepts (as well as many other cognitive, affective, and behavioral variables) actually vary is a major gap in the current literature but will be an important question for future research (see Shiyko & Ram, in press) . Such a task will require more frequent assessments of self-concept, as well as new measurement techniques that are sensitive both to shorter-term changes in self-concept and to the daily or weekly processes (for instance, specific types of social interactions) that may spur fluctuations.",

Yet it is also a time when youths' selfconcepts are of particular importance, as they begin to form a coherent meaning system with values and expectations, with implications for their motivations and engagement in school and social activities, their academic performance and peer affiliations, and their overall well-being. In the present study, we make a new contribution to the literature by examining within-subject variability around youths' overall trajectories of self-concept and the implications of this lability for academic and social adjustment. In doing so, we draw attention to the dynamic nature of self-concept highlighted in theoretical accounts. With greater attention to this dynamic nature, it will be important to continue to gain a more complete understanding of the processes that shape self-concept development over various time scales, and the developmental implications of changes in self-concept.",
