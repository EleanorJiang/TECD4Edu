    "abstract": "This short-term longitudinal study investigated 918 students' school-related affect across the transition to high school. The study focused specifically on the moderating effect of change in student ethnic congruence from middle to high school. Results indicate that students experiencing more ethnic incongruence from middle to high school, in particular African American and male students, reported declining feelings of school belonging over time. Moreover, students experiencing ethnic incongruence also had increasing worries about their academic success. These results suggest that the changing school demographics from middle school to high school may negatively impact students' school-related affect, especially if they move to high schools which include fewer students who are ethnically similar to themselves. As they move from childhood to adulthood, adolescents negotiate a variety of transitions (e.g., pubertal onset, changes in peer networks), and it is within this developmental backdrop that students must navigate the middle to high school transition (Eccles, Lord, & Midgley, 1991; Steinberg, 2002). As students move to high school, they encounter a new (and often larger) school, teachers who may be less available, more challenging classes, older students, and new social cliques.

A number of transition studies have found that both students' grade point averages and their school engagement significantly decline from eighth to ninth grade (Reyes, Gillock, & Kobus, 1994; Roeser, Eccles, & Freedman-Doan, 1999; Seidman, Aber, Allen, & French, 1996) . Less is known, however, about changes in students' psychosocial adjustment, including feelings about themselves and their affective reactions to the school context. Findings from the few studies focused on the psychosocial domain are inconsistent at best. One retrospective ethnographic study of adolescents' experiences of the transition found that students developed more positive self-perceptions from middle school to high school (Kinney, 1993) . A new environment with relative anonymity can sometimes allow students to redefine themselves academically and socially. However, two studies found no significant changes across the transition in students' self esteem (Seidman et al., 1996) or general psychological functioning (Roeser et al., 1999) , and a third (Barber & Olsen, 2004) found declining self-esteem and increasing depression across the high school transition.",

                "text": "The current study sought to extend the existing body of transition research in two ways. First, we examined previously understudied constructs-specifically students' school-related affect as measured by their school worries, school liking, and feelings of belonging. School belonging, or the extent to which students feel included and supported at school, as well as how much students like school may be particularly challenged during periods of transition inasmuch as pretransition friendship groups and social supports are often disrupted. Barber and Olsen (2004) , in one of the only studies to examine school liking, found that students' reports of liking school declined as they transitioned from eighth to ninth grade. In the one high school transition study that included a measure of school belonging, Isakson and Jarvis (1999) found no changes in that construct across the transition. However, that study included a predominantly middle class, Caucasian sample attending a university-affiliated K-8 laboratory school. Exploring school belonging and related affective measures with a more diverse student sample transitioning to more typical secondary schools is warranted. Thus, the second way in which we extended existing transition research was to focus on ethnic minority youth and the factors that might particularly impact the experiences of these youth as they transition to large and complex urban high schools. Over and above the normative challenge of the high school transition, ethnic minority youth may face particular barriers due to their marginalized status. For example, previous experiences of discrimination and prejudice may make ethnic minority youth more sensitive to environmental cues that make their ethnicity salient, which, in turn, could affect their subsequent developmental competencies in either positive or negative ways (see Coll et al., 1996; Cooper, Cooper, Azmitia, Chavira, & Gullatt, 2002) .",

                "text": "One factor that might be especially relevant to the transition experiences of ethnic minority youth is the ethnic composition of their schools. For example, does it make a difference whether adolescents transition to high schools where there are many as compared with few members of their ethnic group, or whether the numerical representation of their ethnic group changes from middle school to high school? One might hypothesize that ethnic congruence-that is, similar numerical representation across transition settings-would be associated with better adjustment because there is less of a mismatch between the social context of the departing and receiving school. In a study of the transition to college that was consistent with this hypothesis, Adan and Felner (1995) reported that African American students who moved from high schools to colleges that were racially/ ethnically congruent experienced better school adjustment and received higher grades than their peers whose high schools and colleges were incongruent. In research on the high school transition of African American, Latino, and Caucasian students, French, Seidman, Allen, and Aber (2000) found that ethnic incongruence from eighth to ninth grade in school staff was associated with more identity exploration, although only for African American students. These authors suggested that the reduced presence of adults who are members of one's ethnic group could be a consciousnessraising experience. However, because that study did not include measures of adjustment, it does not shed light on whether ethnic incongruence would negatively impact students' adjustment across the transition to high school.",

The ethnic diversity in the middle and high schools allowed us to create a measure of ethnic congruence for each participant (i.e., percentage of students who were members of one's ethnic group) across the two school contexts.

Students were initially recruited at the beginning of sixth grade from 11 middle schools in metropolitan Los Angeles, with schools chosen from among those of comparable size in demographically similar low-income/working-class neighborhoods. All schools were eligible for Title 1 compensatory funding and were carefully selected to represent a continuum of ethnic diversity (e.g., from primarily Latino or African American to ethnically diverse). Within these 11 middle schools, students were recruited from 99 classrooms whose teachers expressed interest in the study. Students were re-recruited the Fall of ninth grade to take part in a new study of the transition to high school. According to students' self-reported ethnic affiliation, the sample was 55% Latino (N 5 503), 17% African American (N 5 158), 15% Asian (N 5 134), and 13% Caucasian (N 5 123). Of the Latino students, 62% were of Mexican descent, and approximately two-thirds of the Asian students in our study were of East Asian descent (primarily Korean). More than 90% of Latino and Asian youth were at least second generation (U.S. born children of immigrants), and all were sufficiently proficient in English to complete written questionnaires. We were able to successfully follow 480% of the eighth grade sample, enrolled in 140 high schools in ninth grade.

(2000) except that we used a more conservative cut-off determining incongruence (i.e., 1 SD below the mean as opposed to .5 SD in French et al.) .",

A 2 \u00c2 2 (gender \u00c2 congruence change group) chi-square test of independence revealed that the two congruence groups did not differ by gender (w 2 [1] 5 1.60, p 5 .21).

We found that students experiencing this ethnic incongruence across the transition reported more academic worries in high school than in middle school. We also found that experiences of incongruence may influence the perceptions of some students more than others and for particular types of affective variables. General liking of school was not related to congruence change, whereas feelings of belonging were. Moreover, African American students and boys who experienced ethnic incongruence across the transition were found to have declining feelings of school belonging as they moved from middle to high school. Feelings of belonging, moreso than general liking, capture social adaptation (e.g., finding one's niche, fitting in), a process that is more likely to be influenced by ethnic congruence. In relation to boys, previous research has found that boys perceive less support from teachers (Reddy, Rhodes, & Mulhall, 2003) and are rated as less engaged in school than their female peers (Finn & Rock, 1997) . Experiences of incongruence may make boys' feelings of distance from teachers and disengagement from school in general more salient, and this may in turn diminish their feelings of connection to school.",

We know from previous research that decreasing ethnic congruence at the level of school staff can make ethnic identity more salient for African American students (French et al., 2000) . Also, there is evidence that African American students report more sensitivity to the racial climate in their schools than do other ethnic groups (Reid & Radhakrishnan, 2003) , have greater perceptions of unfair treatment by school personnel based on race (Ancis, Sedlacek, & Mohr, 2000) , and experience disproportionately high levels of disciplinary sanctions compared with other ethnic groups (Costenbader & Markson, 1998) . Thus, it could be that moving to a new school context where there are significantly fewer same-ethnicity schoolmates might heighten African American students' concerns about being a numerical ethnic minority and about being the target of others' prejudice. The fact that ethnic incongruence affected school belonging moreso than other variables is of particular concern given that previous research has found that lower levels of school belonging are associated with higher levels of depression, social rejection, and trouble at school (Anderman, 2002) and poorer performance in academic coursework (Barber & Olsen, 1997) .

Contrary to some previous research, students tended to like their high schools more than their middle schools, and, once in ninth grade, they expressed fewer general worries about school. It is possible that students worried more during eighth grade, in anticipation of transitioning to a new and unfamiliar school setting, but that the actual experience was less stressful than anticipated. It also is possible that the greater liking of high school compared with the end of middle school may reflect the novelty of the former and boredom with the latter. Our data were gathered within the first two months of students' ninth grade year. How school-related affect changes as students acclimate to the routines of high school setting (e.g., the first grading period) is an important topic for future research.",

While our study highlighted the particular risks of incongruence for African American youth, our sample included few Latino and no Caucasian students experiencing incongruence across the transition, and as such, we cannot determine whether our findings around incongruence generalize to students in other ethnic groups. The protective factors that influence incongruent students' school-related affect across the high school transition should also be examined in future studies, with particular attention to whether these protective factors operate similarly across race/ethnicity. We suspect that having a close friendship with someone of one's ethnic group can buffer even large changes in ethnic congruence and feelings of vulnerability, just as friendships have been shown to protect against the negative effects of maltreatment by peers (e.g., Hodges, Boivin, Vitro, & Bukowski, 1999) . Finally, with ethnic groups that were differentially represented in their middle schools, our measure of incongruence did not account for differences in relative ethnic congruence at the eighth grade baseline. For example, we did not make a distinction between changes in congruence for relative majority ethnic groups (e.g., from 80% to 50% of the school population) compared to relative minority groups (e.g., 40 to 10%), when the absolute value of the incongruence score was the same (e.g., \u00c0 .30). Future transition research should examine whether the initial level of congruence experienced by students, that is, the critical mass of same-ethnicity students present in the school, has effects on outcomes over and above the absolute changes in congruence across the transition. Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that our findings will stimulate new ways of thinking about ethnicity as a context for examining the affective consequences of school transitions. Today's multiethnic urban schools provide ideal contexts for such research.",
