    "abstract": "This article addresses the question of the causal ordering of self-concept of ability and academic achievement during elementary school. The questions were (a) Do self-concept and achievement influence each other? and (b) Does it make a difference whether achievement is assessed by marks or by tests? The sample consisted of 697 students from 54 German elementary school classes. The design of the study allowed 3 measurement waves from Grade 2 to Grade 4. Mathematics achievement was measured both by marks and by tests. The results of the structural equation modeling analyses show that it makes a difference whether achievement is (as usually) measured with only one indicator (either mark or test performance), or if both indicators are integrated in the model. The latter model clearly supports the skill development model: In elementary school, prior self-concept does not significantly contribute to the prediction of subsequent achievement.",

                "text": "The direction of causality between academic achievement and academic self-concept has been the subject of considerable interest and speculation in educational psychology (for an overview, see Byrne, 1984; Helmke, 1992; Marsh, 1990a ). On the one hand, there can be no doubt that academic self-concept is formed at least in part by prior achievement. Achievement-related successes and failures influence self-concept through various means, in particular through the evaluation of significant others (e.g., teacher and parents). This consideration underlies the skill-development approach, which maintains that self-concept is primarily the result of past achievement rather than a cause for subsequent achievement. The opposite position is held by the self-enhancement model, which claims that academic achievement depends not only on prior achievement but that prior self-concept also contributes significantly to the prediction of subsequent achievement (cf. Calsyn & Kenny, 1977) . For example, a high self-concept of ability may be a favorable precondition for the initiation and persistence of effort in learning and achievement situations (Helmke, 1989 (Helmke, , 1991 (Helmke, , 1992 . Also, students with a low self-concept might avoid critical learning situations that could threaten their self-concept and thus might show less effort in school. Furthermore, as suggested by self-worth theory (Covington, 1984) , students with low success expectations are prone to develop failure-avoiding tactics (e.g., avoidance behavior, procrastination, or intrapsychic defensive processes). These activities may yield temporary relief, but in the long run they are mostly counterproductive and impair academic achievement.",

                "text": "Given the theoretical and practical significance of the problem, surprisingly little sound research concerning the causal predominance of self-concept or achievement exists. Rather than giving a report of the literature (for a comprehensive review, see Byrne, 1986; Marsh, 1990a) , we restrict our short review to those few longitudinal studies investigating the issue of the causal predominance of self-concept of ability and academic achievement that satisfy the three central prerequisites noted in Byrnes's (1984) review, namely (a) establishment of a statistical relationship, (b) establishment of a clear time precedence, and (c) testing of a causal model. The collection of these studies has been facilitated by the prior work of Marsh (1990b) , who reported six studies fulfilling the criteria just mentioned. We extend the list by adding some more recent studies (see Table 1 ). For methodological reasons, we have not considered longitudinal studies that used the statistical method of cross-lagged panel correlation (e.g., Calsyn & Kenny, 1977; Chapman, Cullen, Boersma, & Maguire, 1981; Marsh, 1987; Pottebaum, Keith, & Ehly, 1986) , because this method has been strongly criticized by statisticians (Rogosa, 1980) . Traditional path analyses (e.g., Bachman & Malley, 1977; Marsh, 1987; Pugh, 1976) and the comparison of simple correlations (e.g., Bridgeman & Shipman, 1978) have been criticized for methodological reasons as well. There is now broad consensus that structural equation modeling (SEM) is the preferable method for a sound analysis of longitudinal panel data. Furthermore, we have not mentioned studies that did not consider both self-concept and achievement at more than one measurement point (e.g., Felson, 1984; Maruyama, Rubin, & Kingsbury, 1981; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1990) .",

Second, the operationalization of academic self-concept varies from assessment by means of a single item to comprehensive scales. Third, the studies differ with respect to the domain under consideration. Half of the studies focused on one subject, such as mathematics or reading, whereas other studies investigated several domains, mostly relying on composite measures (i.e., aggregating both self-concept and academic achievement across various domains). However, some studies (e.g., Faber, 1992; Marsh, 1986 Marsh, , 1990c Marsh, , 1992 Shavelson & Bolus, 1982; Pekrun, 1987) have emphasized that there are considerable differences in the pattern of causal dominance if this issue is analyzed separately for different domains.

The predominant use of teacher ratings as criteria for academic achievement may lead to an inadequate view with regard to the issue of the causal predominance of self-concept versus academic achievement. There has been a long debate as to whether and to what degree teacher ratings are at all reliable judgments (see the critique by Hansford & Hattie, 1982, and Marsh's, 1990b, overview) and whether they actually reflect student achievement. First, it is a well-known fact that marks often serve pedagogical functions too (e.g., disciplining students or encouraging and reinforcing student effort). Second, some studies (e.g., Schrader & Helmke, 1990) have found that students' motivational characteristics (including self-concept) may play a significant role for teachers' judgments of achievement, which is independent of student's actual achievement.",

Repeating all the LISREL analyses in the article using marks standardized by class led to a somewhat lower fit of the models but not to any differences in pattern or magnitude of the regression coefficients in the models. .333 .306 .303 -.195 .213 .209 .598 -.210 .218 .197 .511 .535 -.370 .402 .391 .405 .328 .338 -.272 .306 .269 .398 .374 .395 .684 -.304 .328 .323 .389 .339 .413 .601 .645 -.334 .453 .508 .362 .269 .329 .407 .358 .379 -.353 .389 .430 .332 .311 .331 .447 .383 .428 .658 -.327 .425 .403 .354 .334 .373 .456 .421 .502 .636 .660 -.338 .441 .437 .246 .183 .185 .279 .253 .276 .286 .287 .288 -.470 .562 .570 .341 .283 .263 .363 .268 .312 .355 .325 .339 .661 -.356 .431 .399 .231 .144 .224 .351 .241 .308 .309 .366 .327 .544 .446 -.462 .548 .508 .309 .238 .279 .380 .286 .295 .276 .297 .312 .464 .549 .462 -.244 .359 .417 .164 .106 .148 .319 .220 .268 .305 .374 .281 .319 .302 .544 .320 -.454 .575 .600 .297 .247 .238 .405 .302 .335 .417 .422 .421 .466 .577 .523 .507 .490 Note. The range of marks was from 6 (high) to 1 (low); the self-concept subscales ranged from -2 (low) to +2 (high).

That is, the magnitude of the loadings of the observed variables on the latent variables was allowed to vary between measurement waves. Loadings for the respective models are presented in Tables 4 to 6. In longitudinal research, the residuals of a manifest variable used in subsequent measurement waves are often correlated, indicating correlated measurement errors. Allowing these correlated errors to be estimated generally leads to a better fit of the model and to more accurate estimates of the stability of the latent variables. Therefore, all models were estimated assuming correlated measurement errors (or correlated uniqueness) between all identical indicators for self-concept, marks, and mathematics tests across the three waves (e.g., between the speed tests in Grade 1 and Grade 2, in Grade 1 and Grade 3, and in Grade 2 and Grade 3). The use of single indicators for marks in Model 2a and Model 3 led to problems in the estimation of correlated measurement errors, as will be discussed in the next paragraph. Therefore, for the indicators of marks, a small amount of correlated measurement errors will be fixed in the models. Again, between all identical indicators for self-concept and tests across the three waves, correlated measurement errors will be estimated.",

For example, Marsh (1988 Marsh ( , 1990b pointed out that two problems may arise. First, relations involving these latent constructs cannot be corrected for unreliability of the indicators. Second, the existence of correlated mea-surement errors for these indicators is not testable and controllable. Therefore, initial analyses with marks as a single indicator (i.e., in Model 2a and in Model 3) were conducted in which the assumed reliability of the construct was .90 (cf. Joreskog & Sorbom, 1989, p. 153; Marsh, 1990b) , and the correlated residuals between the different grade estimates were set at 12.5% of the residual variance. In subsequent sensitivity analyses of Models 2a and 3a, the implications of these a priori assumptions were explored.",

It is now widely known that the chi-square likelihood ratio test is sensitive to sample size and that in large samples, the chi-square test will almost always reach significance, indicating a difference between the observed and the predicted covariance matrices. As an alternative, the ^Idf ratio has been proposed. The acceptable numerical values for this ratio that have been proposed by different authors cover a range from 1 to 5 (Byrne, 1989) . In an evaluation of the most widely used indices of goodness-of-fit, Marsh, Balla, and McDonald (1988) concluded that the TLI was relatively unbiased, independent of sample size, and penalized model complexity. Values of greater than .9 are regarded as indicators of an acceptable fit of the model. Both BBI and TLI are computed by comparing the target model with a null model, assuming complete independence of all observed measures, and can be roughly seen as indicating the proportion of covariance explained by the model.

For marks, significant measurement errors were found between Grades 2 and 3 (.17), between Grades 3 and 4 (.23), and between Grades 2 and 4 (.15). The importance in assuming these measurement errors was also illustrated by the fact that a model without these errors showed a poorer fit: x 1 (126, N = 697) = 676.05, x 2 ldf= 5.37, GFI = .89, BBI = .89, TLI = .89; significance of the difference with Model 1, x 2 (18, N = 697) = 324.44, p < .001.

In all cases, the addition of cross-lagged effects led to significant (p < .001) improvements in the fit of the models.

As established for Model 2a, for Model 3a we found that although the stability of the variable marks varied inversely with the assumed reliability of the single indicators, the cross-lagged paths involving this variable varied only marginally, with varying reliability of the indicators and varying correlated residuals. Inspection of the modification indices (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1989, p. 45) indicated that the fit of the model could be improved by allowing for additional covariance between the residuals of the latent variables tests and marks in Measurement Waves 3 and 4. Remember that the covariance between tests and marks in Measurement Wave 2 is already estimated in the model. Therefore, these additional covariances between the two residuals cannot by attributed to correlations assumed in an earlier wave or to the effects of the latent variable self-concept. Two alternative models were formulated to account for these additional covariances. First, Model 3b, where correlations between the residuals of the latent variables tests and marks within .49 Note. Correlation between uniqueness is set at 0%, 12.5%, 25%, or 50% of the uniqueness. Within a given model, the uniqueness for the three mark variables and the three uniqueness correlations among the three grade variables were assumed to be equal. a The headings in this row that follow indicate variables from which path coefficients originate. b The headings in this row that follow indicate resultant variables of path coefficients. Table 3 shows that both alternative models showed im- (Figure 3) and Model 3c (Figure 4 provements of fit as compared with Model 3a. Table 9 shows a comparison of the path coefficients of three versions of Model 3. Table 9 shows that when within-wave correlations were assumed (Model 3b as compared with Model 3a), only marginal differences between the path coefficients occurred. The only meaningful difference occurred in the path from self-concept in Grade 2 to tests in Grade 3. This effect was slightly smaller (.11 vs. .17) in the version of the model assuming within-wave correlations between the residuals. The effect from mathematics tests in Grade 3 to self-concept in Grade 4 increased from .08 to .10 and passed the level of significance. However, when cross-lagged effects were assumed (Model 3c as compared with Model 3a), the model changed drastically. As was expected, the stability of marks and tests decreased somewhat, the effects from achievement (both marks and tests) to self-concept remained fairly the same, but the effects from self-concept to achievement almost completely disappeared. To illustrate the impact of these changes, the significant relations (p < .05) between the latent variables in Model 3c are presented in Figure 4 .

More important for this investigation, however, was the fact that the pattern of path coefficients presented in Figures 1-4 did not change when gender was included as a variable in the analyses. (The maximum change in path coefficients was .06, found in all models as a reduction of the initial [Grade 2] correlation between achievement and self-concept.)

The former models, which use either test performance or marks (such as the majority of relevant studies, see Table 1) , yield a reciprocal model, implying that self-concept in elementary school serves both as cause and as effect.

In other words, an efficient way to improve self-concept of ability in elementary school children is to improve their achievement competence. This result would have clearly been masked if only one indicator of achievement (either marks or test performance) had been used in our study. Furthermore, this model illustrates the relative impact of tests versus marks on subsequent self-concept. Whereas from second to third grade both influences are equally strong (.16 and .17) , there is a tendency toward a stronger impact of marks on selfconcept (.28) from third to fourth grade, as compared with the path from tests to self-concept (.12). Although the result is less clear than we had expected, it underlines the psychologically important differences between tests and marks. The latter are subjectively relevant for students because the mental anticipation of marks may represent a strong incentive for initiating learning activities, effort and persistence (Helmke, 1989) . Also, whereas (in the German school system) marks are usually communicated to the students (often in public, which facilitates social comparison processes), test results are usually not reported to the students. Also, because the students did not know about the math tests in advance, preparation was not possible. Thus, the result of an achievement test probably reflects the actual competence of the student in that domain to a greater extent, but it is subjectively less important because success and failure on these tests have no crucial consequences. Finally, our complex model stresses the dynamics of the interrelationship between both indicators of achievement-grades and test performance-and its changes over time. From the perspective of developmental psychology (cf. Harter, 1983) , our results with regard to the determinants of students' self-concept of ability support the conception of two distinct sources of self-evaluation in children, namely (a) competence, in particular, speed and quality of performance, and (b) evaluation by significant others (here, teachers) and the notion that both of these sources (a and b) appear to operate (at least, to some degree) independently from each other. That is, not only marks (which reflect to a major extent teachers' evaluation of students' cumulative achievement) but also actual competence (or \"mastery,\" indicated by test performance) proved to influence selfconcept development. The experience of solving the test tasks (or failing to solve them) may affect students' selfevaluation even though they were not informed about their individual results. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that some informal within-classroom social comparison processes (e.g., immediately after the completion of the test) may have taken place.",

On the one hand, it is obvious that very large time intervals (e.g., several years) may, depending on the domain and the age level under consideration, mask important developmental phenomena. On the other hand, if one is interested in changes of self-concept and achievement level, conceptualized as relatively stable personality characteristics, daily or weekly fluctuations are certainly less interesting. In our opinion, the smallest natural time lag that makes theoretical sense for the issue of causal ordering of selfconcept and achievement is the time interval between marks, which ranges, depending on the school system, from a couple of months to a semester or even a whole year. Nevertheless, it is possible (and even probable) that in special cases and for some persons certain critical events (e.g., a specific rating or mark, or a comment made by a personally very important person, or another important experience) may lead to abrupt and perhaps even lasting changes in the level of self-concept. The same is true for sudden changes in the level of academic achievement, for example, shifts of competence caused by the emergence of qualitatively different stages of information processing or by sudden insights. To the degree that changes in selfconcept or achievement occur discretely rather than in a continuous manner, designs providing fixed intervals (such as years) necessarily lead to an increase in the error variance.",
