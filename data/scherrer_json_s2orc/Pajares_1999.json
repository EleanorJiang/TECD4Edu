    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to determine the influence of various motivation variables on task-specific mathematics performance and to explore whether these variables change during the first year of middle school (N \u03ed 273). Students' taskspecific self-efficacy was the only motivation variable to predict performance and did so both at start and end of year. There were no differences in anxiety, selfconcept, or self-efficacy for self-regulation between start and end of year, but, by end of year, students described mathematics as less valuable and reported lower effort and persistence. Gifted students had stronger mathematics self-concept beliefs, and they had more accurate and less overconfident self-efficacy beliefs than did regular education students. There were no gender differences in any of the motivation constructs.",

Self-efficacy beliefs are also hypothesized to mediate the influence of other determinants of academic outcomes-such as skill or past performance-on subsequent actions. Efficacy beliefs also act in concert with other common mechanisms of personal agency-such as self-concept beliefs, anxiety, and self-regulatory practices-in influencing and predicting academic outcomes. The area of mathematics has received special attention in self-efficacy research for a number of reasons. Mathematics holds a valued place in the academic curriculum; it is prominent on high-stakes measures of achievement generally used for level placement, for entrance into special programs, and for college admis-sions; and it has been called a ''critical filter'' for students in pursuit of scientific and technical careers at the college level (Sells, 1980) .",

Typically, self-efficacy predicts mathematics performances to a greater degree than does math anxiety (Pajares & Miller, 1994) , previous math experience (Hackett, 1985; Pajares & Miller, 1995) , or self-efficacy for self-regulatory practices (Zimmerman, Bandura, & Martinez-Pons, 1992) . Pajares and Kranzler (1995) found that the influence of self-efficacy on math performance was as strong as was the influence of general mental ability. Across ability levels, students whose selfefficacy is higher are more accurate in their mathematics computation and show greater persistence on difficult items than do students whose selfefficacy is low (Collins, 1982) .",

For example, it seems that boys and girls report equal confidence in their math ability during elementary school, but, by high school, boys are more confident. Even by middle school, boys tend to rate themselves more efficacious than do girls (Pintrich & De Groot, 1990; Seegers & Boekaerts, 1996; Wigfield, Eccles, MacIver, Reuman, & Midgley, 1991) . Gifted girls are especially likely to be biased toward underconfidence in mathematics (Pajares, 1996a) . By middle school, girls are also thought to show less interest in math and report higher levels of anxiety (Catsambis, 1994) . Some researchers have suggested that gender differences in confidence may in part be due to the tendency of boys to be more self-congratulatory in their responses to efficacy instruments and of girls to be more modest (Wigfield et al., 1996) . This gender difference in mathematics confidence has sometimes been called the ''confidence gap'' (see Sadker & Sadker, 1994) , and the middle school years have been identified as the time during which this gap between girls' and boys' self-perceptions of ability emerges (Fennema & Hart, 1994; Wigfield et al., 1991) .",

At this school, 6th grade was the first year of middle school. Information on students' race/ethnicity was collected, but we did not have access to socioeconomic status information. Hence, we do not report race/ethnicity differences that would likely be confounded by socioeconomic factors (see Graham, 1994) . With permission of the principal, parental consent was obtained. None of the students were receiving special services in mathematics. The school followed a mathematics curriculum that integrated arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and measurement and was consistent with the standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The attitude measures were group administered by the second author to 18 mathematics classes one day during the first 9-week period of the academic year (October) and again during the last 9-week period (April). Surveys were read aloud. Classroom teachers were not present during this administration, and confidentiality of their answers was assured to students.

It differs from domain-specific assessments of students' mathematics self-beliefs (such as math anxiety and self-concept). Social cognitive theorists posit that task-specificity and correspondence with the outcome of interest serve to increase prediction of academic outcomes (Bandura, 1997) and that such assessments can provide prediction indexes and insights not available from broader assessments of self-beliefs (Seegers & Boekaerts, 1996) .",

Use the four-step plan to find out how far it will travel in four hours.'').

They provided confidence judgments for each problem. Scores were added across items to form a score that ranged from 20 to 160, and this score was then divided by 20 to provide an average self-efficacy score congruent with the 1-8 Likert scale.

For interest, students were asked whether or not they found mathematics as a subject, as well as solving mathematics problems, interesting (see Seegers & Boekaerts, 1996) .

Bias reveals the direction of the errors in judgment and is computed by subtracting actual performance from predicted confidence. To compute bias, a correct answer on the performance measure was scored 8 and an incorrect answer was scored 1. Recall that the Likert scale for the self-efficacy instrument also ranged 1 to 8. So, for example, expressing no confidence (1) and answering incorrectly (1) reflects zero bias (1 minus 1), whereas the same lack of confidence with a correct answer would receive a bias score of \u03ea7 (1 minus 8), indicating underconfidence. Bias scores ranged from \u03ea7 to \u03e97. Scores greater than zero correspond to overconfidence; scores less than zero correspond to underconfidence. The second measure of calibration was mean accuracy, which was computed by subtracting the absolute value of each bias score from 7. The resultant score reveals the magnitude of the judgment error, which can range from 0 (complete inaccuracy) to 7 (complete accuracy) (see Schraw, Dunkle, Bendixen, & DeBacker Roedel, 1995 , for similar procedures).",

Self-efficacy was assessed at the task-specific level of solving problems on a mathematics exam; mathematics self-concept was assessed at the domain-specific level of mathematics. For Fall models, Term GPA Grade 5 consisted of mathematics grade obtained during last term of Grade 5; for Spring models, Term GPA Grade 6 consisted of mathematics grade obtained during previous term of Grade 6. efficacy and performance (.57 fall, .59 spring) are similar to those obtained in previous studies (see Pajares, 1996b) , although correlations between selfefficacy and self-concept (.66 fall, .70 spring) are higher than those typically found. Correlations between math self-concept and math anxiety were strong (see Pajares, 1996a; Pajares & Kranzler, 1995 , for similar results), but we did not judge them strong enough to merit exclusion of either variable in subsequent analyses. The exam administered in the spring (M \u03ed 12.1) was more difficult than the exam administered in the fall (M \u03ed 15.4), a phenomenon that, no doubt, contributed to the drop in self-efficacy scores (7.1 fall, 6.4 spring) and in calibration scores. Recall that the exam was a high-stakes measure created by the teaching team at the school and reflected the more challenging material covered at that time of the academic year. Table 2 provides results of the multiple regression analyses. As expected, ITBS scores were predictive both in fall (\u03b2 \u03ed .300) and spring (\u03b2 \u03ed .251), and the performance test taken in the fall predicted performance in spring (\u03b2 \u03ed .162). Also as expected, gifted students outperformed regular education students (\u03b2 \u03ed .174 fall; \u03b2 \u03ed .164 spring). Despite these controls, self-efficacy predicted performance at both administrations and was the only motivation variable to do so (\u03b2 \u03ed .267 fall; \u03b2 \u03ed .272 spring). The independent variables accounted for 56% of the variance in performance for the fall model, F (10, 255) \u03ed 34.23, p \u03fd .0001, and 53% for the spring model, F (11, 261) \u03ed 28.48, p \u03fd .0001. To ensure that self-efficacy made an independent contribution, we tested for differences between full models with self-efficacy as a predictor and reduced models without self-efficacy. The significant difference in R 2 revealed that self-efficacy made a modest but independent contribution, R 2 diff \u03ed .03, F (1, 254) \u03ed 17.01, p \u03fd .05, for fall and R 2 diff \u03ed .03, F(1, 263) \u03ed 15.96, p \u03fd .05, for spring.

This finding is consistent with those obtained by other researchers but is notable because of the number of variables used as controls.

These are striking findings in light of the rigorous test of the influence of self-efficacy that inclusion of achievement assessments provide in investigations of academic performances. When researchers gauge the influence of affective factors on these performances and statistically control for previous performance attainments with measures such as standardized achievement tests or GPA, these controls are problematic, in that scores on such assessments are themselves confounded by affective factors. As Bandura (1997) has observed, ''behavior is not a cause of behavior'' (p. 69), and motivational and self-regulatory influences affect both prior and later performance attainments. As a consequence, controlling for previous achievements controls not only for those achievements but also for the prior impact of motivational determinants such as self-efficacy or self-concept on the achievements. Thus, the influence of affective factors on mathematics performance is potentially greater than the results obtained indicate. These confounding influences are not easily disentangled, hence, they should be kept in mind as results are interpreted (see Bandura, 1997, pp. 68-70 , for a discussion of this issue). Note that we used two measures of previous achievement for the fall model and three measures for the spring model.",

Performance, selfefficacy, and calibration scores were lower at end of year than they were at start, but we emphasize that these decreases may be explained by the more difficult spring examination. Additional study using performance measures of similar difficulty at start and end of year will be required to ascertain whether self-efficacy diminishes or whether there is an increasing tendency for 6th-grade students to make less accurate, and more overconfident, judgments of their math capability as the year progresses.
