Leuven, Belgium and ACER, Australia Heidi Pustjens, Jan Van Damme, and Agnes De Munter K.U. Leuven, Belgium The present study investigated (1) gender differences in the longitudinal development of language achievement and school engagement (i.e., effort for language, attitude toward learning tasks, interest in learning tasks, and relationship with teachers) across secondary school (Grades 7-12, ages 12-18) and (2) gender differences in the association between these developmental processes. Data were drawn from the Longitudinal Project in Secondary School (LOSO project) that followed a cohort of 2,270 students in Flanders (Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) during secondary school. We used univariate and multivariate latent growth curve models to analyze the longitudinal data. The results showed, as expected, significant gender differences in the development of language. Girls showed a quasi-linear positive learning gain in language across secondary school, whereas boys started with a decline followed by acceleration in their learning gain in language. With regard to school engagement we observed a decline both for boys and girls, but the decline in the effort for language and the attitude toward learning tasks was steeper for boys than for girls. In addition, we found evidence for a positive longitudinal association between language achievement and school engagement, meaning that students who showed a smaller decline in school engagement also showed more learning gains in language. Moreover, only for boys were the school engagement starting levels related to their learning rates in language.",

According to Finn (1993) , low levels of achievement and, eventually, school dropout may be the end point of a developmental process of disengagement and withdrawal from school that may have begun in the early years of schooling (see also Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004; Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, & Wigfield, 2002) . To test this hypothesis, we need to investigate the developmental trajectories of school (dis)engagement and those of achievement. However, most studies to date that have investigated these issues have relied on cross-sectional methods, which cannot provide insight into the way educational outcomes, such as school engagement and achievement, change over time.",

Previous research has focused either on the longitudinal development of language or on the development of school engagement, but very few studies have investigated the link between these two developmental processes. In addition, we focus on gender differences. We want to address the question of whether boys become more disengaged with schooling than girls over time and whether this negative development is accompanied by a decline in boys' learning rates in language. In order to answer these questions, we will provide longitudinal data on the development of language achievement and of school engagement measures (i.e., attitude toward homework, effort for language, relationship with teacher, interest in learning tasks) for boys and girls across secondary school in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium). In Flanders, secondary school consists of six years (equivalent to U.S. Grades 7-12), and students start secondary school at age 12.",

Al though these results suggest that girls have higher learning rates in language, only longitudinal research, which tracks the language achievement of the same group of students over time, can test such a claim. However, longitudinal evidence of gender differences in learning rates in language is still scarce. One of the few exceptions is Kiplinger's (2004) study, which investigated students' growth in reading and writing achievement from Grade 3 to Grade 10 and found that only at the high school level did girls progress at a significantly faster rate in reading.",

In contrast, Watt (2004a) used complex growth curve models to investigate the development of self-reported effort for language and interest in language of Australian students and found no support for greater declines among boys than among girls between Grades 7 and 11. On the contrary, Jacobs et al.

Most research linking gender differences in school engagement to gender differences in language achievement is cross-sectional. Prior cross-sectional research has shown that school engagement and behavior such as time spent on homework, attention in the classroom, and interest in learning tasks of girls are higher than those of boys. When these gender differences in school engagement are taken into account, the gender differences in achievement become smaller (Anderman & Maehr, 1994; Downey & Yuan, 2005; Freudenthaler, Spinath, & Neubauer, 2008; Van de gaer, Pustjens, Van Damme, & De Munter, 2007; Stowe et al., 2000; Whitelaw, Milosevic, & Daniels, 2000) . In addition, school engagement plays a more important role for boys than for girls. For example, Freudenthaler et al. (2008) found that school-related intrinsic motivation predicted boys' achievement but not that of girls. Likewise, Van de gaer et al. (2007) showed that boys' motivation toward learning tasks and concentration in the class were stronger predictors of boys' achievement. Girls' achievement depended less on school engagement such as interest in learning tasks. Freudenthaler et al. (2008) suggested that girls' lower dependence on school achievement conveyed a substantial advantage for girls, as students need to engage in learning tasks that they do not always like. Stoel, Peetsma, and Roeleveld (2003) conducted one of the few studies that used longitudinal data to investigate the association between the development of language achievement and the development of school engagement. They found a positive relation between the development of school investment and self-confidence and the development of language achievement in elementary school in the Netherlands. This result indicates that students who showed less of a decline in school investment and self-confidence showed higher learning rates in language. However, the study focused on elementary school, a time period in which gender differences are small to nonexistent. The present study examined the association between change in four indicators of school engagement and change in language achievement for boys and girls during secondary school.",

We will investigate four indicators of school engagement: effort for language, the attitude toward homework, the interest in learning tasks, and the relationship with teachers. Based on previous research (Eccles & Midgley, 1989; Hill & Russell, 1999; Olson, 2002; Watt, 2004a Watt, , 2004b Wigfield & Eccles, 2000; Wigfield et al., 1997) , we expect a decline in students' school engagement and an increase in language achievement across secondary school (Hypothesis 1). To investigate the changes in language achievement and in school engagement, we will investigate the nature of the development by modeling data using growth curve analyses. Previous research indicated that linear growth curves are often not complex enough to grasp the gender differences in the development of school engagement (Fredricks & Eccles, 2002; Jacobs et al., 2002; Kolaweski-Jones & Duncan, 1999) . Therefore, we will apply a linear growth curve in a first model. We then test a second model that uses a more complex growth curve, namely a curvilinear or quadratic growth curve assuming that the data fit a curvilinear model. Curvilinear models allow for the identification of more complex developmental patterns (as opposed to a linear developmental pattern) such as a deceleration or acceleration in the rate of decline over time. By comparing these two models (linear versus quadratic), we can test which model shows a better fit to the data.",

In addition, growth curve models assume that there is a latent growth trajectory that underlies the observed outcomes. This means that in the present study a growth curve will be estimated for the whole period of secondary school based on four observations (i.e., end of Grades 7, 8, 10, and 12). Thus, also for time points that were not actually observed such as the beginning of Grade 7, Grade 9, and Grade 11 or in the middle of Grade 8, the growth curve produces estimates. 1860.00 a well-being questionnaire was an adaptation of the schoolvragenlijst voortgezet onderwijs (school questionnaire secondary education) of Smits and Vorst (1982) , supplemented with a number of new items (formulated with the help of a questionnaire by Janssen, 1982) . Using factor analysis, we constructed three scales composed of the same items at the four measurement occasions. These are the interest in learning tasks (e.g., \"I enjoy most of the subjects taught in this school\"), relationship with teachers (e.g., \"I think that most of the teachers are very helpful when I have problems with school work\"), and attitude toward homework (e.g., \"When I have homework, I start as soon as possible\"). Appendix 1 is a full list of the items of each of the scales. The Cronbach's alphas at the different grades are shown in Table 1 . In addition, we asked teachers who taught language to indicate on a 4point scale (ranging from a lot of effort to no effort at all) to what extent each student put effort into the subject language. We used these teacher reports as a measure for the effort for language.",

In contrast, we consider relationship with teachers and interest in learning tasks as two indicators of emotional engagement. Considering effort as an indicator of behavioral engagement needs some further explanation because it can be considered as an indicator of behavioral as well as cognitive engagement. Fredricks et al. (2004) make a distinction between effort that is primarily behavioral (e.g., doing the work) and effort that is more cognitive and aimed at learning and mastering the material (e.g., to go beyond the requirements, perseverance, psychological investment). In the present study, we did not explicitly ask teachers to indicate to what extent students go beyond the requirements. Therefore, we assumed that the measurement of effort in the present study corresponds more to behavioral engagement than to cognitive engagement.",

Two students had no single measure of language achievement; three students had no measure on the vari-ables \"attitudes toward homework,\" \"interest in learning tasks,\" and \"relationship with teachers\" at any of the measurement occasions; and \"the effort for language\" variable was missing at all measurement occasions for only eight students.

This statistical technique allows estimating of individual growth curves that represent change or growth in language achievement and in school engagement across the entire period of secondary school based on four (or five) measurement occasions. With linear growth curves, two growth parameters are estimated, namely an initial level growth parameter (i.e., intercept) and a growth rate parameter (i.e., slope). These parameters are viewed as latent variables, and these latent variables can be estimated using SEM. Both parameters vary between individuals, meaning that for each individual a growth curve is estimated with a specific initial status and a specific rate of change. Because we have (at least) four waves of data, we can also estimate quadratic growth curves that can identify more complex trajectories than linear growth curve models (Singer & Willett, 2003) . Quadratic models include one extra growth parameter, known as the quadratic growth curve parameter or the curvature growth curve parameter. The interpretation of the intercept in quadratic growth curve models is the same as in the linear growth curve models, but the interpretation of the slope or growth rate parameter is somewhat different. In the quadratic growth curve models there is no constant common slope because the growth changes smoothly over time. Therefore, the slope can be interpreted as an instantaneous rate of change or growth that can change over time (as indicated by the quadratic growth curve parameter). We centered the intercepts of language achievement scores and of the four school engagement variables at the beginning of Grade 7.",

Multivariate models estimate both developmental processes simultaneously and thus allow us to investigate whether the change in language achievement is associated with the change in school engagement (Singer & Willett, 2003) . The growth parameters of language achievement were modeled as the dependent variables, whereas growth parameters of (one) school engagement variable were modeled as the independent variables.

We considered a fit greater than 0.90 and 0.95 of CFI and TLI, respectively, as acceptable and excellent fit to the data. RMSEAs less than 0.05 are indicative of a close fit, and values up to 0.08 are considered as reasonable errors of approximation (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Maruyama, 1998) . Chisquare difference tests were used to evaluate differences in model fit between two nested models. Table 1 shows the means, standard deviations, reliabilities, skewness, kurtosis, and number of students for each variable examined at each time point. The skewness and the kurtosis 3 of all the variables in Table 1 are reasonable, indicating that the variables are approximately normally distributed. An inspection of the raw means for language achievement across time reveals that there is no progress in the first two grades but that progress is made in language during the final years of secondary school. An inspection of the means of the school engagement variables shows a general decline in all the attitudinal variables across secondary school.

For each outcome we fitted linear (Model 1 in Table 2 ) and quadratic (Model 2 in Table 2 ) grow curves separately. Table 2 shows the series of nested univariate latent growth curve models. As these two models are nested, we can use the \u03c7 2 difference tests to compare both models and to decide which model (i.e., linear or quadratic growth curve model) fits the data better. The results of the \u03c7 2 difference tests (see Table 2 ; \u0394\u03c7 2 ) showed that a quadratic growth curve clearly fitted the data better than a linear growth curve did for each of the dependent variables except for the variable \"effort\" (\u0394\u03c7 2 is not significant). But because the \u03c7 2 difference tests, like \u03c7 2 tests, are sensitive to sample size, even a small difference may be significant in a large sample, such as is the case in our study (Barrett, 2007; Kaplan, 2000) . Therefore, we also took into account other fit indices. The CFI, TLI, and RMSEA all indicate a better fit of the quadratic growth curves for language achievement, for the interest in learning tasks, and for the relationship with teachers (see Table  2 ). In addition, the overall \u03c7 2 test of model fit (see Table 2 , \u03c7 2 ) was not significant-notwithstanding the large sample size-indicating a good model fit of the quadratic growth curves above the linear growth curves of language achievement and relationship with teachers. Based on the overall \u03c7 2 test, the \u0394\u03c7 2 tests, and the different fit indices, we conclude that quadratic growth curves represent the rate of change better than linear growth curves for language achievement, interest in learning tasks, and relationship with teachers. However, for effort and for the attitudes toward homework, we retained the linear growth curve models. Even though the \u03c7 2 difference test indicated a better fit of the quadratic model for the attitudes toward homework, the CFI, TLI, and RMSEA clearly indicated a superior fit of the linear model. For effort, the fit indices indicated that both linear and quadratic models were equivalent. Therefore, we decided to retain the simpler linear model. Table 3 gives the means, variances, and covariances between the growth factors for language achievement, interest in learning tasks, relationship with teachers, attitude toward homework, and effort.",

Boys, however, caught up with girls by the end of secondary school thanks to their acceleration in growth rate (i.e., negative effect of gender on the quadratic term -.02; d = -0.76). According to Cohen's (1988) criteria for effect sizes, these gender differences in instantaneous rate of change and curvature in language achievement are large. The gender differences on the interest in learning tasks and the relationship with teachers showed similar patterns (Figures 3 and 4 ). Girls and boys started secondary school with similar interest in learning tasks (see nonsignificant effect of gender on intercept .10; d = 0.13) and with a similar positive relationship with teachers (see marginally significant effect of gender on intercept .13; d = 0.18). However, girls' interest in learning tasks initially decreased to a larger extent than that of boys (negative effect of gender on slope -.10; d = -0.24), but girls recovered more than boys (i.e., positive effect of gender on quadratic term .02; d = 0.27) by the end of secondary school.

The beginning of secondary school indeed marks the transition period between elementary and secondary school. It is during this period that we observed stagnation in their learning of language and a decline in school engagement. According to the stage-environment fit hypothesis of Eccles and Midgley (1989) , there is a misfit between the characteristics of the secondary school system and the developmental needs of adolescents, and this misfit may be stronger for adolescent boys than for adolescent girls. For instance, secondary schools can be characterized by a higher focus on discipline and teacher control compared to elementary school, and this difference may be more detrimental to the engagement and the achievement of boys. Boys' higher prevalence of disruptive behavior in the classroom may be a reflection of boys' lower compliance to school rules and their relative lack of acceptance of teacher control and discipline (Johnson, McGue & Iacono, 2005; Stowe et al., 2000) . Some authors have indeed argued that secondary schools and classrooms are feminized environments, meaning that teachers' attitudes, classroom rules, and learning tasks favor girls (Newkirk, 2002) . However, these are only suggestions. Based on our research, we cannot make any causal assumptions between school transition and the lower engagement and language achievement of boys. More research is needed to uncover exactly which characteristics of the educational environment show a larger mismatch with the educational needs of boys than with those of girls.",

According to Fredricks et al. (2004) , it is not unlikely that these two types of school engagement show different developmental patterns (and gender differences). The results of the present study indeed showed that gender differences are more important in behavioral engagement than in emotional engagement. However, we modeled the developmental trajectories of emotional and behavioral engagement in a different way. We modeled the trajectories of emotional engagement by a quadratic growth curve, whereas we modeled those of behavioral engagement by a linear curve. These two different ways of modeling the developmental trajectories may influence, mask, or expose how gender differences become apparent. The results showed that by modeling more complex growth curves (i.e., emotional engagement), more complex gender differences emerged. Therefore, more research is needed to determine whether gender differences in behavioral engagement are more important.",
