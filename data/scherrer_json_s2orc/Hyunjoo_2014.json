We used the fiveyear panel data of the Korea Education Longitudinal Study (KELS) from middle school 7th grade to high school 11th grade. English intrinsic motivation decreased during the middle school years but increased during high school years whereas math intrinsic motivation continually decreased across the whole of the years. Gender differences by subject existed in intrinsic motivations: girls' higher intrinsic motivation in English and boys' higher intrinsic motivation in math; boys' faster decrease in intrinsic motivations during middle school years; boys' slower increase in English intrinsic motivation during high school years. School characteristics only had an effect on intrinsic motivations for high school students: higher math intrinsic motivation of high schools in smallmedium cities; higher intrinsic motivations of students on elite academic tracks.",

However, a relatively few longitudinal studies have been conducted with regard to adolescents' motivational development in different academic subjects (Brockelman, 2009; Deci, Vallerand, Pelletier, & Ryan, 1991; Otis, Grouzet, & Pelletier, 2005) . Moreover, the few existing longitudinal studies on motivation were based on small samples from Western cultures, making it hard to generalize their findings to Asian students. In order to overcome the limits of previous studies, the current study conducted a longitudinal investigation of developmental trends in intrinsic motivation for different subjects during secondary school years, using a large national representative sample of adolescents in Korea. More specifically, this study sought to chart the changes in motivation that occur over time for English and math and for gender with considering various school characteristics, and explain the changes based on the cultural context of Korea.",

This phenomenon of Asian students' low intrinsic motivation but high achievement is remarkable because research on motivation has suggested that higher intrinsic motivation leads to higher achievement (Schiefele, Krapp, & Winteler, 1992; Schunk, Pintrich, & Meece, 2008) .",

The decline of motivation has been explained by the transitions to middle and high school (Anderman & Maehr, 1994; Eccles, 2004; Lee & Smith, 2001 ). As students' grade level goes up, secondary schools become larger and more bureaucratic, place a greater emphasis on performance goals rather than mastery goals, have stricter grading criteria using norm referred tests, and see a decrease in interaction and feedback between teachers and students. All these factors in turn lead to the decline in students' motivation (Leaper, Farkas, & Brown, 2012; Stoyanova & Hope, 2012; Thompson, Woodward, & Stanton, 2011) .",

In other words, the overall level and the development pattern of interest and motivation will be different depending on the subject. For instance, Wolters and Pintrich (1998) found that 7th and 8th graders tend to place greater value in math than English and social science. Another study reported that children's perceived value of language arts rapidly declines during the elementary school years and their perceived value of mathematics declines during the high school years (Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, & Wigfield, 2002) . In many Asian countries including Korea, both of English and math are important subjects for students' successful college entrance (Choi & Kim, 2013) . However, students also learn English as second language for leisure goals such as traveling abroad and communicating with people from different cultures (Gardner, 2010) . Due to such additional instrumental value of learning English for leisure, English intrinsic motivation could decrease less compared to math intrinsic motivation.",

For example, recent studies based on Singaporean students reported that girls' intrinsic motivation decreased more rapidly as they got older compared to boys (Price & Yates, 2010; Yeung, Lau, & Nie, 2011) . Other studies found that the intrinsic motivation related variables such as self-efficacy, self-esteem, and self-concepts also decreased rapidly for North American girls as they grew older (Eccles et al., 1983) . These differences in motivational development trends by subjects may be further magnified by gender, especially in the specific gender dominant domains such as language and math. The gender differences in motivation are affected by the various socialization processes and learning environments that imply specific subjects are masculine or feminine, which could discourage students from engaging in opposite sex domains (Aronson & Steele, 2005; Kahle & Meece, 1994; Ullman, 2010) . In fact, as adolescents get older and gain a clearer concept of gender roles, their interest in different subjects is affected by their perceived gender role. For example, girls tend to have lower levels of intrinsic motivation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), whereas they tend to show a higher level of interest in language compared to boys (Fouad et al., 2010; MacCallum & Kim, 2000; Meece, Glienke, & Burg, 2006) .",

Regarding school urbanity, schools located in central cities and rural areas showed higher dropout rates and lower achievement due to low academic motivation, which is associated with income inequality and poverty (Jargowsky, 1997; Seo et al., 2007) . For funding type, it was found that the school dropout rate was lower and achievement level was higher for Catholic private high schools compared to the other school types (Coleman & Hoffer, 1987; Rumberger & Thomas, 2000) . In Korea, national schools are a special subtype of public schools and each national school is affiliated with a college of education in a national university.

It has been debated whether or not the random school assignment policy affects educational outcomes in terms of student achievement, and research has shown mixed evidence (Goldhaber, 1999; Tooley, Bao, Dixon, & Merrifield, 2011) . Some research showed that the school equalization policy decreased the achievement gap among schools (Kim, Lee, & Lee, 2008) whereas other research reported a slightly higher level of achievement in equalization regions (Kang et al., 2005) or no significant differences in achievement between school equalization regions and non-school equalization regions (Kim, Kim, & Ryu, 2009) .

English intrinsic motivation decreased during middle school years and increased during high school years, even after controlling for gender and various school characteristics. However, math intrinsic motivation decreased continually across the entire secondary school years. This result is in line with research that showed intrinsic motivation to be a domain-specific construct by reporting a continuous faster decline of intrinsic motivation in math and science than in English and social studies during secondary school (e.g. Gottfried et al., 2001; Jacobs et al., 2002) .",

The previous research has consistently reported a continuous decrease in intrinsic motivations across various subjects including English during the secondary school years (e.g., Harter, 1981; Otis et al., 2005) . One possible explanation is that most previous studies were on relatively small samples of American and European students whereas the present study targeted a large sample of Korean students. In addition, previous research examined the motivational change until 10th grade and found a continuous motivational decrease while this study extended the age span to 11th grade and found an increase from 10th to 11th grade. In line with this study, Gottfried et al. (2001) found a slight increase in intrinsic motivation from ages 16 (11th grade) to 17 (12th grade). Moreover, there are differences in the school system between Western countries and Korea. Western students usually transition from elementary school to middle school at 6th grade and transition from middle school to high school at 9th grade whereas Korean students transition to middle school at 7th and transition to high school at 10th grade. Thus, the difference in the transition ages could lead to different patterns in motivation development.",

In other words, elite academic high schools allow admission to outstanding students with high intrinsic motivation in English and math through entrance examinations, whereas such rigor in English and math is not required of students of vocational, art, and sports high schools. Thus future research is needed to investigate the effect of curriculum track on intrinsic motivation in English and math with the selection bias eliminated.",

Specifically, it is noteworthy that intrinsic motivation in English as a foreign language increased during high school years even though it decreased during middle school years. In addition, intrinsic motivation in math decreased faster for boys in middle schools. Because these new findings of the study were found by employing longitudinal analysis of representative large scale data, the results could be used to draw firmer conclusions about developmental trends.",

Second, it is also worthwhile to consider how other psychological and environmental factors affect motivational development, factors such as social relations, environment, aspiration, academic achievement, and SES. Finally, since our sample was restricted to Korean students, future research must investigate whether these results could be generalized to other Asian countries, and identify the particularity and universality in motivational development across various cultures.",
