                "text": "and focus (Evangelou et al., 2008) . One important marker of transition success is academic attainment as measured by school grades. Academic attainment has well established associations with outcomes later in life such as occupational status, income and health (Mirowsky & Ross, 2003) . We set out to test if academic attainment following transition is predicted by psychological functioning (emotional problems; affect towards school; conduct problems) at the start of secondary school. If psychological functioning does predict attainment following transition, it is a potential target for interventions rather than, or in addition to, academic attainment. Although there is literature that examines the association of psychological functioning with academic attainment (e.g. Ansary & Luthar, 2009; Burt & Roisman 2010; Hinshaw, 1992; Miech, Caspi, Moffitt, Wright & Silva, 1999; Moilanen, Shaw & Maxwell, 2010; van Lier et al., 2012) little, if any, focuses on associations around the period of transition to secondary school. We focus on the first year of secondary school as an important period of vulnerability during which schools may be able to implement interventions. Nearly all pupils express some concerns about moving to secondary school. For most, however, worries about transition appear to be temporary and decline during the first year (Lucey & Reay, 2000; Galton, Morrison & Pell, 2000; Rice, Frederickson & Seymour, 2011) . Thus, pupils with persistent difficulties across the first year of secondary may represent a vulnerable group.",

However, the temporal direction of effects remains unclear with other studies reporting that lower attainment predicts increases in depressive symptoms (Pomerantz, Altermatt, & Saxon, 2002) . Most research focuses on adolescent depression and examines academic outcomes in late adolescence or early adulthood. Given that there are developmental differences in the prevalence, risk factor profile and aetiology of depressive symptoms during childhood, adolescence and adulthood (Jaffee et al., 2002; Rice, 2010) , examining the relationship between depressive symptoms and attainment in early adolescence may give a different pattern of results which are more directly relevant to transition.",

Several studies have found associations with lower academic attainment, but these have often investigated social anxiety rather than general anxiety (e.g. Van Armeringen, Mancini & Frarvolden, 2003; Weeks, Coplan & Kingsbury, 2009) . One study which looked at different kinds of anxiety in childhood found generalized anxiety to be associated with a greater likelihood of graduating from high school (Borges et al., 2011) . Indeed, a study of university students found that anxiety was associated concurrently with better academic performance, suggesting that worrying does not adversely affect attainment (Svanum & Zody, 2001 ). Instead, fear and apprehension associated with attainment during school transition may be best captured by affect or anxiety about school rather than a general index of anxiety. Separate examination of the effects of general anxiety, school anxiety and depression on academic attainment may help to clarify temporal associations. We hypothesized that depressive symptoms would show association with poorer academic attainment over time but that general anxiety would not.",

Despite the relative lack of prospective longitudinal research, on the basis of prior research, we hypothesized a bi-directional relationship between school affect and academic attainment.

While dichotomous measures of educational failure may fail to capture subtle effects on different aspects of academic attainment, there is also a need for measures of academic attainment that are not affected by shared method variance.

Masten and colleagues (2005) suggest that emotional problems could affect academic competence within short follow-up periods but not over longer periods of time, whereas the effects of conduct problems tend to be found for both. This likely stems from the fact that emotional problems are often episodic and may therefore exert transient influences on academic attainment (e.g. via impaired motivation or concentration).",

Thus, these models assess the direction of influence across time, which is a crucial step in addressing questions of causality. The models are estimated throughout using manifest measures and all paths are tested simultaneously. This produces fully saturated models with no degrees of freedom; goodness of fit indices therefore cannot be estimated. We were primarily interested in the nature of the relationship between psychological functioning and academic attainment and how these associations might differ by gender, rather than in testing nested models of different theorised pathways of influence on a given variable. The fact that models were fully saturated was therefore not deemed an impediment to hypothesis testing.",

For girls, attainment at the start of year 7 predicted later school concerns. At the end of year 7, within time gender differences were also found for anxiety, which correlated with lower attainment for boys (school anxiety) and higher attainment for girls (school and general anxiety). These results indicate that for emotional problems and affect towards school, boys are more vulnerable to poor academic attainment. In contrast, for girls, these symptoms do not adversely affect attainment and for some measures even seem to be associated with better attainment. This is consistent with a number of clinical observations where although the prevalence of emotional problems tends to be lower in boys, boys with emotional problems have worse functional outcomes (Diamantopoulou, Verhulst & van der Ende, 2011; Dunn & Goodyer, 2006) .",

Research is needed to disentangle the direction of effects between psychological functioning and changes in academic attainment during this transition. Our findings underline the importance of psychological adjustment to academic achievement by showing that a number of indices of psychological functioning assessed when pupils enter secondary school significantly predict academic progress in the first year of secondary school.Novel aspects of this study included: (1) the use of a cross-lagged panel design which controlled for prior attainment and psychological functioning, (2) the focus on an important but under-studied transition period and (3) the simultaneous measurement of emotional problems, affect towards school and conduct problems to identify which specific aspects of psychological functioning are important as far as academic attainment is concerned. The association of depressive symptoms, affect towards school and conduct problems with later academic attainment is evident despite strong continuity of academic attainment."

Conduct problems, consistently showing associations with later academic attainment, may be a useful target at the beginning of secondary school to improve academic outcomes for pupils. School liking, and for boys, school concerns, are additional potential targets for interventions, showing associations with later attainment above and beyond the influence of conduct problems. Depressive symptoms may not predict poor achievement in school per se, but for boys, it may herald the beginning of a developmental pathway that leads to reduced academic attainment perhaps via associated reductions in school liking and/or increases in conduct problems. While conduct problems and school liking may be better targets for interventions at transition across both genders, depressive symptoms and school concerns in boys are a potential marker for subsequent academic problems and may represent a target group for specialized support."
