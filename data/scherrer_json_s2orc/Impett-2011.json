Multivariate Latent Growth Curve Modeling (MLGM) was used to test the association between body objectification and both self-esteem and depressive symptoms with data from 587 adolescent girls who began the study at age 13 and completed the study at age 18. Results revealed that body objectification decreased, self-esteem increased, and depressive symptoms remained relatively steady across adolescence. Girls who experienced decreases in body objectification also tended to increase in self-esteem and decrease in depressive symptoms over the course of adolescence, even after accounting for several factors known to be associated with positive youth development including race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational achievement, religiosity, and body satisfaction. Practical implications for reducing objectification and enhancing girls' well-being through health, physical, and sexuality education, as well as through media literacy programs are discussed.

                "text": "Feminist theorists have argued that women are sexually objectified in Western cultures (Bartky, 1990; de Beauvoir, 1952) . Sexual objectification occurs when individuals are treated as bodies for the use and pleasure of others (Bartky, 1990; Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) and when their value is appraised solely from their sexual appeal (American Psychological Association [APA] Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls, 2007) . From representations in the mass media to daily social interactions, girls and women are more likely than boys and men to be viewed as sex objects and subjected to evaluations of their appearance (see review by Ward, 2003) . In an effort to enhance social desirability and their own self-evaluations, girls and women may monitor and shape their appearance to increase their physical attractiveness. The act of observing and evaluating one's own appearance from an outsider's perspective is termed self objectification (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) . The process of objectifying one's own body is quite a common experience for adolescent girls and young adult women; indeed, research shows that physical appearance is an important-and perhaps the most important-basis of adolescent girls' and young adult women's self-worth (e.g., Harter, 1987) . Fredrickson and Roberts (1997) theorize that viewing the self from an outsider's perspective may create anxiety over potential negative evaluations, leading women to constantly monitor their appearance to prevent such evaluations. This vigilant attention to one's appearance can be detrimental to women's mental health in multiple ways.",

For example, cross-sectional studies of college students have found positive associations between body objectification and depressive symptoms (e.g., Muehlenkamp & Saris-Baglama, 2002 , Szymanski & Henning, 2007 , and negative associations between body objectification and self-esteem (McKinley & Hyde, 1996; Mercurio & Landry, 2008) . Further, body objectification has been shown to undermine eudaimonic well-being-that is, well-being related to self-realization and optimal functioning. For example, body objectification reduces intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy (Gapinski, Brownell, & LaFrance, 2003) , flow states (Greenleaf, 2005) , and autonomy and vitality (Breines, Crocker, & Garcia, 2008) .",

Although there is some disagreement about the exact ages at which adolescence begins and ends, the period around the onset of puberty (ages 10-14) is typically classified as early adolescence, and the period around the transition to legal and cultural adulthood (ages 17-22) is typically classified as late adolescence (Elliott & Feldman, 1990) or emerging adulthood (Arnett, 2000) , with middle adolescence occurring between these two periods. As girls move into adolescence they are presented with a number of challenges that increase the likelihood of body objectification and the negative mental health consequences associated with it. A recent review by Hyde et al. (2008) posited that social and biological aspects of the adolescent transition (such as pubertal hormones and peer sexual harassment) place adolescent girls at an increased risk for body objectification, as well as for other cognitive vulnerabilities implicated in depression.",

From this perspective, girls' self-views are shaped by social pressures to behave in ''feminine'' ways, including presenting their bodies in ways that meet societal standards of beauty. Although the pressures on girls to enact femininity are not absent from early and middle childhood, these pressures may ''intensify'' during adolescence (e.g., Aub\u00e9, Fichman, Saltaris, & Koestner, 2000; Wichstr\u00f8m, 1999) . The increase in gendered social pressure is likely to result in adolescent girls' increased vulnerability to negative mental health outcomes. Indeed, Grabe, Hyde, and Lindberg (2007) found a link between body objectification and depression among girls, but not boys, over a 2-year period from age 11-13. Along the same lines, Tolman and colleagues found that at a critical period in adolescent development (i.e., in the eighth grade), body objectification accounted for almost 40% of the variance in self-esteem and nearly 30% of the variance in depression (Tolman, Impett, Tracy, & Michael, 2006) .",

The mission of the report was to ''examine and summarize the best psychological theory, research, and clinical experience addressing the sexualization of girls via media and other cultural messages, including the prevalence of these messages and their impacts on girls, and include attention to the role and impact of race/ ethnicity and socioeconomic status'' (p. 1). In the report, the task force members concluded that although we know a considerable amount about the harmful effects of objectification and sexualization on women's well-being, much less is known about how objectification impacts girls and their development throughout adolescence. In particular, the authors of the report called for more research on the ''shortand long-term effects of viewing or buying into a sexualizing objectifying image'' as well as ''how these effects influence girls' development of self-esteem'' (p. 43). In the current paper, we analyzed data from a 5-year longitudinal study of adolescent girls' psychosocial development to examine how changes in body objectification relate to changes in two markers of girls' well-being during adolescent development: selfesteem and depressive symptoms.",

Thus, there is limited knowledge about how body objectification changes during adolescence, as well as whether changes in body objectification correspond with changes in adolescent girls' well-being. To address these shortcomings, we used data from a 5-year longitudinal study of 587 adolescent girls surveyed in the 8th, 10th, and 12th grades to test 2 main sets of hypotheses regarding girls' body objectification, self-esteem, and depression during adolescence.",

Specifically, we expected that the girls in our sample would experience decreases in body objectification over a 5-year period of adolescence. There are at least two reasons to suspect that girls may decrease in body objectification as they mature. First, the meaning and experience of being in one's own body changes as girls undergo puberty in a society that objectifies girls' and women's appearance (Bordo, 1993; Brumberg, 1997) . Pubertal development may heighten the extent to which girls objectify their bodies in early adolescence, and these feelings may decline as girls mature. Indeed, in a small qualitative study of adolescents, girls who scored low in objectification tended to be slightly older, on average, than more objectifying girls (Hirschman, Impett, & Schooler, 2006) . Second, as girls move into and through adolescence, their conceptualization of the self is likely to change. Specifically, Damon and Hart (1988) argue that whereas it is normative for children and early adolescents to evaluate themselves in comparison to their peers and social norms, older adolescents often define themselves in reference to their personal beliefs and standards. Although some adolescents will continue to rely on external standards of comparison, many others are likely to develop a stable internalized sense of self and thus be better equipped to resist selfobjectification as they mature.",

Specifically, we expect that girls who score low in body objectification will have higher self-esteem and fewer depressive symptoms than girls who are more likely to objectify their bodies. The major conceptual and methodological advance of this research, however, is in testing longitudinal associations between body objectification and both self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Here, we expect changes in body objectification to predict changes in both of these markers of well-being. That is, we anticipate that girls who decrease in body objectification will experience increases in self-esteem and decreases in depressive symptoms over a 5-year period in adolescence.",

In a 5-year longitudinal study, body dissatisfaction prospectively predicted depressed mood and low selfesteem in early adolescent girls (Paxton, Neumark-Sztainer, Hannan, & Eisenberg, 2006) . Given that the dominant cultural ideal of beauty is unattainable to many women, most women who self-objectify and evaluate their own appearance from an outsider's perspective are likely to be dissatisfied with their own bodies. As noted above, however, body objectification is likely to have negative consequences for girls' mental health above and beyond those due to body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, we sought to distinguish the effects of body objectification on girls' well-being from the established effects of body satisfaction, as well as from possible effects of race/ethnicity, SES, academic achievement, and religiosity.",

For the current study, MLGM allowed us to evaluate if girls' self-esteem and depression changed over the course of adolescence, and then to ascertain if changes in body objectification predicted changes in both self-esteem and depression. MLGM is an approach to random-effects modeling which is optimal for the study of change over time. Standard LGM uses a constrained structural equation model (SEM) to model unique change trajectories for each individual. The primary advantage of using an SEM framework for random-effects modeling is that multiple growth processes can be modeled simultaneously, covariates can be either time-varying or time-invariant, and missing data are more easily addressed. Unlike repeated-measures analysis of variance, the LGM approach does not necessitate exclusion of cases with missing values, an inevitable circumstance in longitudinal research.",

Using standard loadings, one factor is modeled as the initial intercept or baseline of the growth curve (the intercept factor), and the other factor estimates the degree of linear change over time (the slope factor). In the present study, the factor loadings for the intercept factor were fixed at 1 for each assessment year (Duncan et al., 2006) , and estimates can be interpreted as expected scores at the baseline of the study (i.e., in the eighth grade). Linear change was modeled across the three time points by fixing the slope factor loadings at 0, 2, and 4, respectively, which yields slope estimates interpreted as the expected yearly change in each construct. Linear growth trajectories were chosen based on previous research suggesting that adolescent girls may gradually increase in self-esteem, decrease in depressive symptoms (Impett et al., 2008; Kling et al., 1999) , and decrease in body objectification (Hirschman et al., 2006) as they mature throughout adolescence.",

Maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors was used to minimize the effects of any nonnormality on the test statistics. Minority status (White vs. racial/ethnic minority) was coded as \u00c0.5 and .5 and the remaining covariates (SES, religiosity, educational achievement, and body satisfaction) were all grandmean centered to yield average intercept and slope estimates. The associations between the time-varying covariates (religiosity, educational achievement, and body satisfaction) and self-esteem and depression were held constant across the three assessments. In addition to the chi-square statistics used to assess overall model-fit, we report two other fit indices commonly reported in structural equation modeling: the Comparative Fit Index ([CFI]; Bentler, 1990) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The CFI is a common model fit index that is forced to vary between 0 and 1, with values greater than .95, indicative of good fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999) . The RMSEA is an index that represents a population-based assessment of the amount of model misfit that is less dependent on the sample size and distributional properties of the sample; it further compensates for the effect of model complexity. RMSEA values of .06 and lower are indicative of good fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999) . Finally, we used maximum likelihood estimation which requires missing data to be missing-at-random (MAR). MAR assumes that data are not missing completely at random (MCAR), but that data are missing conditional upon other factors that are measured in the data (Schafer, 1997) .",

Before testing the model in Figure 1 , we estimated separate univariate growth curves for body objectification, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms to confirm significant variance in the growth parameters. Further, we were interested in determining whether mean levels of body objectification, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms changed significantly throughout adolescence. The descriptive statistics shown in Table 1 show that the mean levels of body objectification decreased, mean levels of self-esteem increased, and depressive symptoms remained relatively stable over time (with a slight increase in depressive symptoms in the 10th grade as compared to Grades 8 and 12). The tests of the univariate growth curves, shown in For example, for body objectification, the statistical significance of the mean value of the linear slope (\u00c00.06, p < .001, in Table 3 ) suggests that, on average, we expected girls to decrease in body objectification .06 units (or .41 standard deviation units) each year from the 8th to the 12th grade, a value consistent with the trend reported in Table 1 . In addition, the variances of the body objectification intercept (0.38, p < .001) and slope factor (0.02, p < .05), the self-esteem intercept (0.28, p < .001) and slope factor (0.02, p < .01), and the depressive symptoms intercept (6.40, p < .001) and slope factor (0.53, p < .05) were significant, indicating that there was sufficient interindividual variability in the baseline and rate of change estimates for these three constructs to conduct further analyses.",

We also extended previous cross-sectional work on girls' body objectification by expanding it into a longitudinal context. In particular, we found that normative decreases in objectification from early to late adolescence corresponded with increases in self-esteem and decreases in depressive symptoms. That is, the same girls who came to objectify their bodies less throughout adolescence also experienced increasing levels of well-being in terms of higher self-esteem and fewer depressive symptoms.",

Consistent with previous research, increases in academic achievement (i.e., grades) corresponded with increases in self-esteem (Schmidt & Padilla, 2003 ). In the model for depression, race/ethnicity was a significant covariate, with White girls reporting fewer depressive symptoms over time than racial/ethnic minority (mostly Latina) girls; this finding is consistent with previous research showing that ethnic minority women tend to report more depressive symptoms and depressive episodes than do White women (Costello et al., 2008; Van Voorhees et al., 2008) .

First, although the sample included moderate numbers of both White and Latina (mostly Dominican) participants, girls from other racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Asian American and African American) were underrepresented. We could not test for possible differences in the association between body objectification and well-being in girls of differing racial/ethnic groups due to insufficient numbers of girls composing each group. Previous research suggests that Latina girls may objectify their bodies to a greater extent than do White girls (Hirschman et al., 2006) , whereas African American girls may do so less than White girls (Richter, 2000) . It remains to be seen, however, whether and how a girl's race/ethnicity impacts the ways in which body objectification shapes the development of her self-esteem and depression in adolescence. Future research is needed to examine the potential ways in which race/ethnicity, class, and other factors shape the link between body objectification and girls' well-being over the course of adolescence. Second, the direction of causal relations remains to be determined. Our theoretical framework suggests that that low self-esteem and depressive symptoms are liabilities of internalizing an observer's perspective on the body. It could also be, however, that a girl who experiences depressive symptomatology and evaluates herself negatively may, in turn, be more likely to internalize sexualizing messages and objectify her body. It is also possible that a bidirectional relationship exists. That is, internalizing sexualizing messages may lead girls to question their worth as individuals; the more depressive symptomatology (e.g., subclinical or clinical levels) they experience, the more distanced they may become from their own bodily feelings. Research involving the experimental manipulation of girls' feelings of body objectification is needed to establish definitively a causal link between body objectification and adolescent girls' well-being (Fredrickson, Roberts, Noll, Quinn, & Twenge, 1998) .",

Researchers of body image are reporting a growing trend toward male body obsession (e.g., McCreary, Sasse, Saucier, & Dorsch, 2004; Olivardia, Pope, Borowiecki, & Cohane, 2004) . In one study (Olivardia et al., 2004) , college men's dissatisfaction with their bodies was closely tied to measures of mental health such as self-esteem and depression, as well as to the use of performance-enhancing substances (i.e., over-the-counter supplements or anabolic steroids). These findings point to a potentially important difference between how boys and girls see and evaluate their own bodies; whereas girls focus primarily on altering the way their bodies look, boys may place a greater emphasis on altering the way their bodies perform (i.e., increasing their athletic performance).",

Thus, our measure may not have provided the cleanest assessment of self-objectification. Future research on the role of self-objectification in shaping adolescent girls' well-being should use other measures of self-objectification including the new measure created specifically for preadolescent and adolescent girls (Lindberg, Hyde, & McKinley, 2006) , which was not yet available at the time of our data collection. Second, in our study, we assessed girls' levels of depressive symptomatology as opposed to clinical depression. Mean levels of depressive symptomatology in our sample were quite low in comparison to other samples of girls using this measure (Kovacs, 1992) .

First, although previous research has indicated that girls typically experience a decline in self-esteem during early adolescence (e.g., Robins, Trzesniewski, Tracy, Gosling, & Potter, 2002) , our findings suggest that recovery from this decline is normative. Accordingly, parents, teachers, and health practitioners working with adolescent girls can shift their focus, in part, from the deficits that cause declines in self-esteem to the resources adolescent girls can use to enhance self-esteem as they develop. Programs or activities that encourage adolescent girls to consider the values they possess in attributes other than appearance have been shown to result in increased mental health. Programs that encourage girls' math and science skills, for example, have documented positive effects on self-esteem (Kerr & Kurpius, 2004) . Adolescent girls' participation in sports has also been linked with increased self-esteem, however the benefits may depend on girls' motives for participation and the extent to which a sport provides girls with opportunities to value the strength and functions of their bodies rather than appearance (e.g., Daniels & Leaper, 2006) . Findings from our study suggest that such activities might be specifically beneficial to the extent that they assist girls in resisting objectification. Focusing on experiences and attributes that can be leveraged to enhance well-being, as opposed to deficits that may lead to risk, is the cornerstone of strength-based approaches. Such strength-based approaches are gaining traction in the study and promotion of adolescent mental health (Seligman, Steen, Park, & Peterson, 2005) and in youth work with adolescent girls (Brown, 2005) . Historically, deficit approaches have been used extensively with racial/ethnic minority communities, so it seems especially important to include strength-based approaches when working with racial/ethnic minority youth and families (Lee, 2010) .",

How might girls learn to become less self-objectifying and more embodied? Several types of programs have the potential to enable girls to resist pressures to self-objectify including health education, physical education, sexuality education, and media literacy programs (Hirschman et al., 2006) . For example, programs that teach yoga to young girls may be one way in which girls may learn to shift their focus from how their bodies look (to themselves and others) to how their bodies feel. In one study, young women who attended a 2-month yoga immersion program reported that they objectified their bodies less after participating in the yoga program than before they began the program (Impett, Daubenmier, & Hirschman, 2006) . Media literacy provides another example of a type of program that may enable girls to resist self-objectification. Media provides a concentrated dose of objectifying images of women and girls in North American culture (see review by Ward, 2003) . Teaching girls (and boys) to critically analyze and evaluate media messages provides educators with an opportunity to combat the sexual objectification of girls and women in the media and may subsequently promote greater feelings of well-being among girls and boys alike.",

In a subsequent set of analyses, we conducted multigroup analyses to determine whether the primary hypothesized relationships significantly differed across the two data sets used in this study (i.e., the ''Health Relationships Study'' and the ''Media Study''). Specifically, the associations between the body objectification and the self-esteem/depression intercepts (Path A), as well as the associations between the body objectification intercept and the self-esteem/body objectification slopes (Path D), were freely estimated for each group. Chi-square difference tests indicate that there was no significant difference between these two groups on these paths for the model predicting girls' depression, Dw 2 (2) \u00bc 1.65, p > .05. However, there was a significant difference for the model predicting girls' self-esteem, Dw 2 (2) \u00bc 13.13, p < .001. Subsequent analyses revealed that the association between body objectification and girls' self-esteem at the baseline of the study (i.e., in the eighth grade) was stronger for the girls in the Healthy Relationships Study (b \u00bc \u00c0.57, p < .001) than it was for girls in the Media Study (b \u00bc \u00c0.29, p < .001). Nonetheless, because both of these associations were statistically significant, and because the associations between the body objectification slope and the slopes of both self-esteem and depression did not differ by group, the overall conclusions of our article remain unchanged.",
