Analyses showed changes in self-efficacy beliefs and learning goals, whatever students' level of achievement and gender. However, self-efficacy beliefs appeared as the most powerful predictor ofacademic performance at both school levels. In addition, the pattern of relations between academic performance and the variables examined was relatively similar at both times of measurement. The discussion focuses on changes in self-efficacy beliefs and learning goals and on their relations to academic performance.",

Student competencies and strategic capabilities facilitate the learning process. These cognitive resources, however, are but of little help if students are beset by self-doubts about their competencies or motivation. In fact, student motivational resources act concurrently as agentic motivators and behavioural regulators for the successful attainment of goals Bouffard & Bordeleau, 1997; Eccles, Wigfield, & Schifele, 1998; McCombs, 1989; McCombs & Marzano, 1990; Palmer & Goetz, 1988) .",

Self-efficacy is not an exact representation of peoples' true competencies, but rather an interpretation of their competencies biased by the value and reasons attributed to past performances in similar situations. A high perception of one's efficacy leads to a greater selfactualization and a higher interest in a given subject, more satisfaction in having met the challenges and in the long run, strong performance accomplishments. A great number of studies have demonstrated the relations between self-efficacy beliefs, self-regulation (i.e. cognitive mechanisms for the application and regulation of strategies by students in the performance of tasks) and the achievement of cognitive and scholastic tasks (Bandura, 1986; Berry & West, 1993; Borkowski, Carr, Rellinger, & Pressley, 1990 ; Bouffard-Bouchard, 1990 Bouffard-Bouchard & Pinard, 1988; Bouffard-Bouchard, Parent, & Larivee, 1991; McCombs, 1989; Multon, Brown, & Lent, 1991; Schunk, 1982; Zimmerman, 1986 Zimmerman, , 1993 Zimmerman & Martinez-Pons, 1990; Zimmerman, Bandura, & Martinez-Pons, 1992) .",

                "text": "Learning goals essentially concern the various reasons that motivate a student to enter into a particular educational activity (Dweck, 1986) . They can be divided into three main categories: mastery, performance and avoidance goals. Mastery goals emphasize the development of skills and their mastery. Attention is focused on increasing one's abilities, while valuing the efforts needed to achieve them. Setbacks and failures are considered as a normal part of the learning process, and for students pursuing such goals, in spite of the shortterm risks involved, the tasks they most prize are those with a sufficiently high level of difficulty enabling them to acquire knowledge. Performance goals emphasize the demonstration of competence through the achievement of high grades and superiority over peers. Student focus on this goal is mainly to show off competence that will be more manifest as the task will be accomplished with little effort. Students with this learning goal perceive setbacks and failures negatively because they are considered as obvious signs of incompetence. Even though they are not likely to learn as much, students with this goal will prefer those relatively easy tasks, which entail little or no risk of error and high probability of success attainment. Finally, avoidance goals emphasize the minimum requirements needed to pass and the limitation of efforts to do so. With such a goal in mind, students are neither concerned with improving nor demonstrating their competencies, but only with avoiding failure. Various studies dealing with the relationship between learning goals and academic performance of students from different school levels have come to the conclusion that those students with mastery goals are more involved in effective self-regulation activities in their studies and succeed more often than students with performance goals (Ames & Archer, 1988; Bandura, 1986; Dweck, 1986; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Elliot & Dweck, 1988; Meece, Blumenfeld, & Hoyle, 1988; Nicholls, 1984; Nolen & Haladyna, 1990; Pintrich & Garcia, 1991) .",

                "text": "According to social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986; Dweck, 1986; Dweck & Legget, 1988; Eccles et al., 1998; Pintrich & Garcia, 1991) , the moti vational processes that support the use of cognitive and self-regulatory processes are based on student's self-efficacy beliefs and learning goals. A more or less active and self-regulated use of cognitive and self-regulatory processes influences performance, which in turn affects self-efficacy beliefs (invalidating or confirming them) and learning goals (Boileau, Bouffard, & Vezeau, 2000; Bordeleau & Bouffard, 1999; Midgley, Arunkurnar, & Urdan, 1996; van Damme & Mertens, 2000; Wigfield, Eccles, Suk Yoon, Harold, Arbreton, Freedman-Dean, & Blumenfeld, 1997) . However, this bidirectional mechanism can be interrupted, and according to some, the changes in the physical and social environment associated with the transition phases that mark a students' academic career can lead them to call into question their values and goals (see Adler, 1984, and Mac Iver, 1989 , for a survey of related literature). Consequently, the transition from elementary to secondary school is often considered as a particularly significant event (Anderman & Maehr, 1994; Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Blyth, Simmons, & Carlton-Ford, 1983; Eccles et al., 1984; Maehr & Anderman, 1993; Midgley, 1993; Midgley, Anderman, & Hicks, 1995; Watt, 1998; Wigfield, Eccles, Mac Iver, Reuman, & Midgley, 1991) . The authors posit various reasons to explain this critical transition. For instance, secondary school would represent an environment where skills and performance are valued above learning goals. The evaluation criteria and practices are seen as less flexible, thus making it more difficult for the student to maintain the same level of achievement. Moreover, the importance placed on grades would be reinforced and emphasized through public distinctions and social rank. All this at a time when peers playa particularly important role in students' lives, and in an environment that has become more impersonal due to the increased number of individuals, as well as to the practices that help create a competitive atmosphere, which is less suitable for interpersonal relations. According to Eccles et al. (1998) , these environmental aspects would undermine positive school attitudes, self-efficacy beliefs, and the pursuit of suitable learning goals.",

(1998) , even though the changes are not dramatic for most young people, a large majority of studies shows that the transition from elementary to secondary school impacts negatively on various dimensions of students' motivational system, as seen in the negative attitudes towards school and learning (higher anxiety, depreciation of school, etc.), and lowered confidence in their competencies and in motivation in general. Certain studies however suggest that the phenomenon is less generalized, and that individual variables such as the student's gender, academic performance in elementary school or level of ability in the tested subject matter could modulate the impact on the transition to secondary school.",

Whereas Wigfield et a!. (1991) conclude that girls and boys undergo similar changes, a more recent study by Anderman and Midgley (I997) suggests that the pattern of reactions could vary depending on students' gender. The authors report that in the weaker group, the academic performance of girls has diminished considerably, but remained unchanged for boys, whereas in students from the higher group, girls' performance improved and boys' fell. In a study on students who were met at the beginning and end of their first year in secondary school, Watt (1998) also reports that changes in students' self-efficacy beliefs vary depending on their level of skills. However, contrary to the two previous studies, students ranked in the lower group have shown diminished self-efficacy beliefs, while students in the average and high groups do not experience any such changes. Also, while boys report a reduction in their expectations of success, girls' expectations remain unchanged. fiinally, the study by Chung, Elias, and Schneider (1998) reports a substantial reduction in achievement levels for boys and a constancy of results for girls.",

French was chosen as the subject matter because it is one of the two prerequisite subjects needed to advance to secondary school. The second objective is to examine the evolution of the pattern of relations between these variables, and the third objective is to compare, at both school levels, the relationships of the variables with students' academic achievement. Given the lack of consensus that has arisen from the studies dealing with the first two objectives, no precise hypothesis can be formulated and the investigations are undertaken in an exploratory manner. However, based on the abundant literature that has demonstrated the positive impact of selfefficacy beliefs and mastery goals on academic achievement, and the less conducive impact of performance and avoidance goals, we hypothesized that at both school levels, the self-efficacy beliefs related to French and to the use of strategies, as well as the mastery goals, will impact positively on academic achievement, while performance and avoidance goals will have a negative effect.",

At both grade six and Secondary I, students classified in the high group for academic achievement reported higher self-efficacy beliefs in French as well as in the use of subjectrelated learning strategies. In addition, students' scores at grade six were higher than those they reported at Secondary I for both self-efficacy beliefs in French (M:::3.86 versus M:::3.69), and in the use of subject-related learning strategies (M:::5.69 versus M=5.39). Therefore, whatever students' gender or group of academic achievement, all reported a decrement in their self-efficacy beliefs after their transition from elementary to secondary school. In addition, interaction effects were also found between time of measurement and types of goals F(2,668)=17.08, p<.OOI, and between level of academic achievement and types of goals, F(2,668):::11.12, p<.OOl. The interaction between time of measurement and types of goals was due to performance goals remaining stable while mastery goals decreased (M=5. IO versus M=4.80), and avoidance goals increased (M:::2.84 versus M=3.02) from grade six to Secondary I. The interaction between level of academic achievement and types of goals was due to students in the high academic achievement group reporting higher mastery and performance goals and lower avoidance goals than students in the low group. Finally, at both school levels girls reported lower performance and avoidance goals than did boys. To sum up, it appeared that whatever students' gender or group of academic achievement, all lowered their mastery goals and concurrently increased their avoidance goals following their transition from elementary to secondary school level, The second aim of the study is to examine how evolves the pattern of relations between self-efficacy beliefs and learning goals according to students' gender and level of academic achievement at the end of elementary school (see Table 2 ). The two sample test for correlation coefficient (p<.05) was used to verify whether the relations observed at grade six and Secondary 1 differ. The relations were generally stable from grade six to Secondary 1. Among the 28 comparisons of correlation coefficients computed only two were significantly different between school levels. Girls in the low academic achievement group were involved in both cases. They showed stronger links at Secondary 1 than at grade 6 between self-efficacy beliefs in French and avoidance goals (r=-.23 and r=-.56, respectively at grade six and Secondary I), as well as between self-efficacy beliefs in the use of subject-related learning strategies and performance goals (r=.01 and 1\"=.34, respectively at grade six and Secondary 1). The third objective is to compare, at both school levels, the relationships of the variables with students' academic achievement.

Also, examination of the colinearity indices (VIF) for all measures showed that all were inferior to 2, suggesting that multicolinearity should not affect the regression analysis' results, and that the linear relationship assumption between these variables could be supported.

At Secondary I, together the variables accounted for 39.4% variance of students' academic performance in French F(5,324)=41.59, p<.OO1. The unique contribution of academic performance at grade six reached 14.9%, that of self-efficacy beliefs in French reached 9.8%, gender contribution was 6.6%, whereas that of performance and mastery goals reached respectively 1.7% and 1.5%. Similarly to what was observed at grade six, avoidance goals were unrelated to academic performance, mastery goals were negatively related and all other variables were positively related.",

Furthermore, in accordance with most research in the field, students in the high level group of academic achievement in grade six score higher in both measures of self-efficacy, both before and after their transition into secondary school, than students in the group with lower academic results.

In the entire referenced literature on the impact of the transition to secondary school, we found no study that examined this issue under the same perspective.

According to the hypothesis, the analyses show that the self-efficacy belief related to the subject matter is the variable that contributes the most to the total variance in academic achievement. Its contribution reached approximately 10% at each academic level, even though in secondary I the influence of students' achievement in grade six had been controlled for. The higher percentage of variance explained in academic performance in Secondary 1 than in grade six is due mainly to the contribution of the previous year's achievement that was accounted for in the analysis of Secondary I, but not of grade six. These ultimate findings concur with numerous studies of various cohorts (groups of normal students, gifted and disabled students at the elementary, secondary and college levels, etc.) having shown that selfefficacy beliefs are a powerful predictor of academic achievement (Berry & West, 1993; and Pajares, 1996 , for reviews of literature).

No support was found in that the expected negative relation between avoidance goals and achievement was not observed, whereas relationships between achievement and performance and mastery goals were contrary to expectations. An important difference between previous studies and ours is the distinction we made between performance goals that value performance as a means of attaining the best-possible results, and those, which we have named avoidance goals, that value performance as a means of avoiding failure. This distinction, suggested by certain authors (Elliot & Harackiewicz 1996; Nicholls, Patashnick, & Bobbit Nolen, 1985) , allowed us to observe that the pursuit of performance goals, when distinct from avoidance goals, favours academic achievement. Dupeyrat (2000) has also shown that, in young adults returning to school, performance goals have had positive impacts on their academic functioning. In a study where one of the two types of performance goals corresponded to ours, Wolters, Yu, and Pintrich (1996) reported positive relationships with students' achievements in English, mathematics and social sciences.",

                "text": "The negative relationships between mastery goals and academic achievement observed at both scholastic levels, are, however, more difficult to explain, even though a few other studies have observed such relationships (Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Stipek & Gralinski, 1996) . As stated earlier, these goals represent students' pursuit of the development and consolidation of skills and the acquisition of knowledge, and the pursuit of these goals would enable a valuation of effort, a resiliency in the face of setbacks and failures and an acceptance to face the challenges of difficult tasks that provide the occasions for learning new competencies. We can consider two possible explanations for our findings even though only a future study will enable to examine their validity. In the first place, it is possible that a relatively exclusive centring on this type of goal, without any concern for a good performance, enables students to develop new skills and knowledge that do not, however, have immediate positive effects on achievement because they are not part of the prescribed subject matter. The second explanation is quite different and considers the capacity of our scale, as well as most others in the field, to adequately measure the goals of all students. For instance, let us consider a student who believes he possesses limited competencies. Aware, or at least convinced of this, he probably will not aim for a high performance, which does not necessarily imply that he is only aiming to avoid failure. Such a student may want to function or learn with the best intentions. Therefore, when asked to specify his learning goals, he will reply that mastery goals best describe his pursuits. According to this explanation, among all students who pursue mastery goals, a certain number of students can hardly expect to achieve high performances, which could partly explain the negative association between this type of goal and achievement. In a recent study, Dupeyrat, Marine, and Escribe (in press) were able to demonstrate that a distinction, within learning goals, between the acquisition and consolidation of knowledge and skills, and challenges and confrontation with difficult tasks, leads to different conclusions in regard to their relations with self-regulatory academic strategies. More studies must be done in order to better distinguish the different dimensions of mastery goals.",

However, the structure of variables in students' motivational system is not perturbed by these reevaluations as evidenced by the constancy of variable interrelatedness from one year to the next. Furthermore, the comparison of both academic levels in regard to factors of academic achievement has led to the observation of an important resemblance in relationship pattern. Except for the higher percentage of variance in Secondary 1 largely due to the inclusion of the previous year's performance in the analysis, the most important difference between school levels concerns the contribution of gender, which increases from 3.4% in grade six to 6.6% in Secondary I. This observation must be considered, however, by taking into account the stereo typic nature of the subject matter, in this case French, in which girls generally outperform boys, as this study and others have shown. In this perspective, we can suggest that this result backs up the view held by certain authors who posit that the effects of stereotypes tend to increase with students' age (see Meece & Courtney, 1992, for a review of literature). A repeat-study, in which other academic subjects are examined, should verify that the findings observed here are not specific to the tested subject matter and can be applied to other domains of learning.",
