                "text": "Engaging in moderate conflict is normative during adolescence as children and parents renegotiate roles and relationships (Collins & Steinberg, 2006) . Currently, there are two parallel literatures on parent-adolescent conflict. One focuses on conflict centered on \"minor,\" \"everyday\" issues such as arguing about schoolwork, chores, and routines (Galambos & Almeida, 1992; Laursen, Coy, & Collins, 1998; Smetana, 1989) . The other focuses on conflict centered on more \"serious,\" acculturation-based issues rooted in differing cultural values, namely, adopting more mainstream American independenceoriented values versus retaining more heritage culture family-oriented values (Lee, Choe, Kim, & Ngo, 2000; Portes & Rumbaut, 1996) . The everyday conflict literature has focused primarily on European Amer-ican and African American adolescents and their families, whereas the acculturation literature has focused on Asian American and Latino adolescents and their families. We consider these two literatures to be parallel because, to our knowledge, no study has examined both types of conflict concurrently within a single investigation. Accordingly, in this study, we use a Chinese American sample to explore, longitudinally, (a) the relation between everyday conflict and acculturationbased conflict, and (b) how everyday conflict and acculturation-based conflict are uniquely associated with adolescent adjustment.",

Becoming autonomous means, in part, taking up increasing responsibilities for making decisions and managing one's everyday life. Disagreements over the timing and nature of the responsibilities (e.g., when and to what degree adolescents are allowed to make decisions in various areas of life) can lead to parentadolescent conflict. Although parent-adolescent conflict has been widely studied, less is known regarding whether conflicts in particular domains (i.e., everyday vs. acculturation-based) differentially predict adjustment.",

Accordingly, Chinese Americans are an ideal population in which to examine the interrelations of everyday and acculturation-based conflict and the implications of conflict for adjustment, as they most likely engage in both types of conflict. Importantly, parent-adolescent conflict may have particularly dire consequences for adolescents of Chinese background, especially if their families adhere to the traditional cultural emphasis on family interdependence, obligation, and cohesion. Indeed, one study found that parent-adolescent conflicts were more highly correlated with problem behavior (e.g., antisocial behavior, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, school misconduct) among Chinese American adolescents compared with European American adolescents (Chen, Greenberger, Lester, Dong, & Guo, 1998) . Similarly, another study found that family conflict was more strongly associated with depression for Chinese adolescents than U.S. adolescents (Greenberger, Chen, Tally, & Dong, 2000) . Thus, depending on the particular ethnic or cultural context, engaging in open parentadolescent conflict may be associated with different developmental outcomes for the adolescent (Smetana, 2008 ). Because we focus on a single ethnicity, we do not test the proposition of differential pathways directly, but rather, our study will contribute to an understanding of how the two types of conflict relate to adolescent adjustment within Chinese American families.",

                "text": "In the early family conflict literature, the finding that parents and adolescents engaged in conflict over \"everyday\" issues was a surprise (Smetana, 2002) . The term \"everyday\" is used here to refer to everyday issues such as schoolwork, home chores, and attire (Smetana, 1989 (Smetana, , p. 1052 . Initially, researchers believed that parents and adolescents argued over more serious and complicated values such as religious and political views (Smetana, 2002) . However, large-scale survey studies showed that parents and adolescents generally agreed on these important values (Offer, 1969) . Where they disagreed concerned everyday issues. The finding that European American families tend to engage in conflict around everyday issues to a greater degree than deeper value-based issues led researchers to focus on how conflict over everyday issues was developmentally important. Everyday conflict has been explicitly linked to the developmental goal of autonomy (Fuligni, 1998; Smetana, 2002; Steinberg & Morris, 2001 ). Engaging in parentadolescent conflict is seen as an opportunity for adolescents to negotiate and challenge their parents and, in the process, realign the parent-adolescent relationship into a more mature one. In contrast, acculturation-related conflict is not viewed as developmentally important in promoting autonomy-perhaps because much of the literature on acculturation-based conflict has focused on Latino-and Asian-heritage families, both of which have been described as emphasizing family, connectedness, and relatedness over the individual and his or her autonomy.",

Portes and Rumbaut (1996) introduced the concept of acculturation dissonance-a mismatch in the cultural values, attitudes, and beliefs between children and parents due to differing rates of integration with the mainstream culture (Kwak, 2003; Lee et al., 2000) . This dissonance can be disturbing and lead to greater parent-adolescent conflict over core cultural beliefs (Juang, Syed, & Takagi, 2007; Kwak, 2003; Lee et al., 2000; Portes & Rumbaut, 1996; Qin, 2006) . Thus, acculturation theorists propose that parents and adolescents engage in conflict primarily because of clashing cultural values.",

The Asian American Family Conflict Scale (FCS; Lee et al., 2000) assesses 10 types of conflicts that can be attributed to acculturation differences (over and above intergenerational differences) between parents and adolescents, such as showing respect to elders, sacrificing personal interests over family interests, and wishing parents would show more physical and verbal affection. Such acculturative conflict has been consistently linked to negative outcomes, including greater depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and poorer academic performance (Bahrassa, Syed, Su, & Lee, 2011; Juang et al., 2007; Lee & Liu, 2001) . In contrast to everyday conflict, levels of acculturation-based conflict are not similar across ethnic groups; Asian Americans reported higher levels of acculturation-based conflict compared with Latinos and European Americans (Lee & Liu, 2001 ).",

For Chinese-heritage adolescents, parent-adolescent conflict may not peak in early adolescence but in later adolescence, as the push for autonomy occurs at later ages compared with European American adolescents (Fuligni, Tseng, & Lam, 1999; Greenberger & Chen, 1996) . With this in mind, our sample of mid-to late adolescents should provide an adequate window to examine stability and change in conflict. Because of the later push for autonomy for Chineseheritage adolescents, everyday conflict may increase from mid-to late adolescence. On the other hand, there is evidence that because adolescents spend less time with family and more time with peers as they get older, there are fewer opportunities for parentadolescent conflict, thus decreasing in frequency over time (Laursen et al., 1998) .",

Another possibility is that, similar to everyday conflict, the frequency of acculturationbased conflict may decrease over time, partly due to less time spent with family (Laursen et al., 1998) .

Thus, although group trends in family conflict have been identified, our study uses latent growth curve modeling to explore whether individual parent-adolescent trajectories show variation over time. This is important because it also allows for the prediction of change trajectories. This framework also allows for the investigation of transactional relations between individual adolescent and family characteristics (e.g., gender of child, immigrant status) and change patterns over time. Finally, using latent growth curve modeling allowed us to examine how everyday and acculturation-based conflict relate to one another over time.

Although the link between parent-adolescent conflict and poorer adolescent adjustment is well documented, only a few studies (e.g., Qin, 2006 ) adopt a longitudinal approach. Further, most studies have examined how parent-adolescent conflict contributes to adolescent adjustment yet have rarely examined the reverse-the role of adolescent adjustment to experiences of parent-adolescent conflict. One important aspect of this study is the focus on transactional relations between parent-adolescent conflict and adolescent adjustment. Transactional models emphasize that it is the bidirectional relations between individuals and the contexts they inhabit over time that explain developmental outcomes (Sameroff & Mackenzie, 2003) . Examining the relation between conflict and adjustment may be especially salient during adolescence, as parent-adolescent conflict is considered a key process by which adolescents develop into mature, autonomous individuals (e.g., Steinberg & Morris, 2001 ). Based on a transactional view of development (Sameroff & Mackenzie, 2003) , we expect that conflict would contribute to adolescent adjustment and vice versa.",

We expect, however, that there would be individual variation in stability and change in both types of conflict over time. Second, we hypothesize that acculturationbased conflict and everyday conflict would be positively correlated at Time 1 and across time. Third, we hypothesize that acculturation-based conflict would predict adjustment (i.e., more conflict associating with greater depressive symptoms, loneliness, anxiety/somatization, and lower self-esteem) at Time 1 and across time. We also expect that adolescent adjustment would predict levels of conflict such that better adolescent adjustment would predict lower levels of conflict across time.

We used LGM because our hypotheses require the estimation of parallel process models, which examine how multiple trajectories relate to one another (e.g., testing how change in one construct relates to change in another). The analysis proceeded in four steps. First, we estimated unconditional growth models for acculturation-based conflict and everyday conflict separately to describe change over time in the two types of conflict. Second, we ran a parallel process model with both types of conflict to see how the two covaried over time. Parallel process models allow for the specification of two or more growth models simultaneously and permit an investigation of how the growth factors interrelate. The third step was to conduct parallel process models by specifying growth parameters for acculturation-based conflict and measures of psychological functioning (i.e., anxiety/somatization, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and self-esteem). In the fourth step, we added everyday conflict as a third construct in the parallel process model to determine whether acculturation-based conflict was predictive of psychological functioning over and above everyday conflict. These analyses allowed us to test one of the primary research questions of the study, namely, whether acculturation-based conflict and everyday conflict uniquely predict psychological functioning. In all of the conditional parallel process models, we included Time 1 age, gender, immigrant status, and parent education as time invariant controls. Gender and immigrant status were both dummy coded (0 \u03ed male, 1 \u03ed female; 0 \u03ed foreign born, 1 \u03ed U.S. born, respectively), and age and parent education were standardized. All other variables were kept in their original metrics. Missing data estimation was conducted using full information maximum likelihood because it tends to yield efficient and unbiased parameter estimates when random missing data are present (Enders & Bandalos, 2001 ).",

More importantly, we found support for the second hypothesis, that acculturation-based and everyday conflict were positively related to one another at Time 1 and over time. For immigrant families, then, conflicts over everyday issues are related to conflicts over broader issues of acculturation. On the surface, acculturation-based conflict taps into deeper cultural value differences than everyday conflict. These cultural value differences, however, may manifest as conflict over everyday issues. Arnett (2009) argues that conflict over everyday issues (such as what clothes to wear) can reflect more serious issues (such as parents being uncomfortable with their adolescent's emerging sexuality). For Chinese American families in particular, discussing certain topics (such as sexuality) is avoided (Kim & Ward, 2007) . Engaging in conflict over everyday issues, then, may be one way that parents and adolescents can more comfortably address deeper underlying issues. Thus, parent-adolescent conflict over everyday issues may be touching on broader areas of conflict related to parents' and children's acculturation processes.",

Greater levels of acculturation-based conflict were associated with higher anxiety/ somatization, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and lower selfesteem, consistent with previous cross-sectional research documenting the association between parent-adolescent conflict and poorer adjustment among Asian-heritage families (e.g., Juang et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2000; Lim, Yeh, Liang, Lau, & McCabe, 2009) . Over time, however, conflict was differentially related to adjustment. For anxiety/somatization and self-esteem (but not loneliness, or depressive symptoms), increases in acculturation-based conflict were related to increases in adolescent anxiety/somatization and decreases in self-esteem. Thus, anxiety/somatization and self-esteem appear to be closely tied to conflict in terms of mirroring the conflict trajectory. Further, unexpectedly, adolescents who started off with higher levels of anxiety/somatization, loneliness and depressive symptoms and lower levels of self-esteem also decreased faster over time in acculturation-based conflict. In general, the reverse was not the case-initial levels of conflict did not predict changes in adjustment over time-suggesting that psychological adjustment is a better predictor of trajectories of conflict than vice versa, but in complex ways. Most studies of parentadolescent conflict have conceptualized conflict as leading to poorer adjustment. However, our findings suggest that poorer adjustment may sometimes foreshadow less conflict in the future. It could be the case that adolescents who are more anxious, depressed, and withdrawn may be less motivated to engage in this particular type of conflict in the home. In other words, adolescents who are more anxious, depressed, and withdrawn may be less likely to challenge cultural traditions and engage in acculturationbased conflict. Although the relations between adjustment and conflict are most likely reciprocal (as evidenced by the significant link between increases in acculturation-based conflict and corresponding increases in somatization/anxiety and self-esteem over time), our findings emphasize the importance of adolescents' psychological functioning to their perceptions of parent-adolescent conflict. Because the direction of our findings was unexpected, more research is needed to replicate and confirm our findings.",

Initial levels of everyday conflict were associated with initial levels of anxiety/ somatization, depressive symptoms, and self-esteem. Unlike acculturation-based conflict, however, there was no consistent pattern of initial levels of psychological functioning predicting change in everyday conflict. One notable finding was that higher initial depressive symptoms predicted a faster increase in the rate of everyday conflict over time. This result contrasts the finding that higher initial levels of depressive symptoms were predictive of a faster decrease in acculturation-based conflict. How do we reconcile these contrasting findings between everyday and acculturation-based conflict? Fuligni (2012) suggested that one way to make sense of findings regarding conflict is to distinguish between the different aspects of conflict, namely, the acculturation gap (e.g., differences in parent-adolescent cultural values), internal conflict (e.g., having conflicting feelings about acculturation gaps), and actual arguments (i.e., open conflicts). Each of these aspects of conflict may have different relations with adjustment. Our measure of everyday conflict assessed frequency of actual arguments, whereas the acculturation-based conflict measure may have tapped into more internal feelings of conflict. Over time, then, perhaps open conflict is more consequentially related to depressive symptoms than internal feelings of conflict. Indeed, others have observed that open conflict in Chinese American families is usually avoided (Qin, Chang, Han, & Chee, 2012) but, when present, can have particularly negative consequences for the adolescent (Chen et al., 1998) . In sum, cross-sectional results for everyday and acculturation-based conflict are consistent-higher levels are associated with poorer adjustment. Longitudinally, results for everyday and acculturation-based conflict are less consistent, suggesting that these two types of conflict, although similar, are distinct in how they each relate to adolescent adjustment over time.",

Another issue in need of resolution is whether acculturation-based conflicts are specific to a particular cultural group or specific to immigrant groups only. There is evidence that the Lee et al. (2000) scale is reliable and valid with non-Asian, nonimmigrant groups such as African Americans and European Americans (Lee & Liu, 2001 ). Thus, it may be difficult to isolate conflicts due to intergenerational clashes from those due to the acculturation process. However, Lee et al. (2000) did find that a greater perceived acculturation gap was related to greater parentadolescent conflict, and studies show that Asian American youth consistently report higher levels of parent-adolescent conflict than Latino, European American, and African American youth (Lee & Liu, 2001) . In contrast, studies using the Issues Checklist (for everyday conflict) find similar levels of conflict across different ethnic groups (e.g., Fuligni, 1998) . Lee et al.'s (2000) scale, at least, seems to be tapping into intergenerational or acculturationbased issues that everyday conflict scales such as the Issues Checklist may overlook. Taken together, these findings suggest that both everyday and acculturation-based conflict are important to include in assessing parent-adolescent conflict for families of various cultural backgrounds.",

Recognizing this would counter the perception that immigrant family relations are always \"at risk\" or in crisis (see Coll & Magnuson, 1997) . Indeed, recent qualitative studies reported that some young adults of immigrant families who engaged in acculturation-based conflicts with their parents as adolescents reinterpreted those conflicts later as young adults. Instead of viewing these conflicts as primarily negative, the young adults discussed how these conflicts helped them redefine their relationship with their parents by improving communication and promoting better understanding, which ultimately enriched their relationships and brought them closer to their parents (Kang, Okazaki, Abelmann, Kim-Prieto, & Shanshan, 2010; Stuart, Ward, Jose, & Narayanan, 2010) .",

Nonetheless, there were several limitations that must be noted. First, we only used questionnaire data. Other methodologies such as personal narratives, in-depth interviews, or observations of family interactions would offer additional insights into how conflict is experienced. Second, we only used self-report data from adolescents; thus, the possibility of common method variance cannot be ruled out. And although there is evidence that adolescents provide more \"accurate\" accounts of conflict with their parents (aligning with independent observer accounts) than parents do (Gonzales, Cauc\u00e9, & Mason, 1996) , future research should also incorporate parents' reports to provide a more complete and complex picture of parent-adolescent conflict. Third, we did not address how parent-adolescent conflict, under certain conditions, may relate differentially to adolescent adjustment. From a risk and resilience perspective (Luthar, Cichetti, & Becker, 2000) , not all adolescents who are exposed to the same risks (such as parent-adolescent conflict) will be affected in the same way. Future research should examine variables that may buffer the negative effects of conflict on adolescent adjustment. For instance, engaging in some levels of conflict may not be harmful to the adolescent if it occurs within a supportive relationship with parents.",

It will also be important to pinpoint specific domains of conflict that may be more consequential for adjustment, consider the dynamic relation between adolescent psychological functioning and parent-adolescent conflict, and elaborate on factors that can provide a supportive context for adolescents as they grow and adjust to changing relations with their parents.",
