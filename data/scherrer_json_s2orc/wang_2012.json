    "abstract": "This study examined the relative influence of adolescents' supportive relationships with teachers, peers, and parents on trajectories of different dimensions of school engagement from middle to high school and how these associations differed by gender and race or ethnicity. The sample consisted of 1,479 students (52% females, 56% African American). The average growth trajectories of school compliance, participation in extracurricular activities, school identification, and subjective valuing of learning decreased from 7th to 11th grades (mean ages = 12.9 years to 17.2 years). Different sources of social support were not equally important in their impact on school engagement, and the effect of these sources differed by the aspect of engagement studied. For instance, peer social support predicted adolescents' school compliance more strongly and school identification less strongly than teacher social support.

Although considerable research has focused on school engagement (Appleton, Christenson, Kim, & Reschly, 2006) , few longitudinal studies have investigated the influence of contextual factors on school engagement developmental trajectories. Research suggests that social support from teachers, peers, and parents can promote positive academic outcomes and prevent negative psychological outcomes during adolescence (Garnefski & Diekstra, 1996; Malecki & Demaray, 2007; Wang, Selman, Dishion, & Stormshak, 2010) . Can these three sources of social support also facilitate school engagement? In this study, we examine the trajectories of four indicators of school engagement (school compliance, participation in extracurricular activities, school identification, and subjective valuing of learning at school) from 7th through 11th grades and investigate whether social support from teachers, peers, and parents contributes to changes in school engagement over time.",

                "text": "School engagement is a multidimensional construct that includes behavioral, emotional, and cog-nitive components (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004) . Behavioral engagement includes (a) positive conduct, compliance with school rules, and absence of disruptive behaviors (Connell, 1990) and (b) participation in school-related activities (Finn, 1993) . Emotional engagement includes (a) positive affective reactions in the classroom such as enjoyment and interest (Skinner & Belmont, 1993) and (b) personal identification and belonging (Voelkl, 1997) . Cognitive engagement includes (a) motivation to learn, intrinsic motivation, and task valuing in school (Ames, 1992) and (b) self-regulated learning strategies such as planning, monitoring, and evaluating one's own progress (Zimmerman, 1990) . Until quite recently, most empirical studies have measured school engagement as either a unidimensional construct of these various indicators or at most two of the three types of school engagement (Perry, Liu, & Pabian, 2010) . These practices preclude investigation of the differences among the various types of engagement and understanding their possible antecedents and consequences. Thus, we conceptualize school engagement as a multidimensional construct reflecting each of the three subtypes suggested by Fredricks et al. (2004) : (a) school compliance (behavioral engagement), (b) participation in extracurricular activities (behavioral engagement), (c) school identification (emotional engagement), and (d) subjective valuing of learning (cognitive engagement).",

Researchers have suggested that racial barriers and lack of accessibility cause African American students to perceive school and related academic aspirations as unimportant or unattainable, leading to their academic disengagement from school (Mickelson, 1990; Ogbu, 2003) . Research on school engagement, however, has produced mixed evidence on racial or ethnic differences (Ainsworth-Darnell & Downey, 1998; Sirin & Rogers-Sirin, 2005) . In Johnson et al. (2001) , African American students reported lower levels of school attachment but were more likely to pay attention and complete homework. In contrast, Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey's (1998) analysis of students in the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) found that African American students reported spending less time on homework than European American students. In Voelkl (1997) , African American students had higher levels of school identification (sense of belonging and valuing school) than European American students. Moreover, many of the existing studies on racial or ethnic differences in school engagement and achievement confound ethnicity with social class due to marked ethnic group differences in the distribution of social class within each group and the different historical reasons for variations in social class across different ethnic groups (Harris, 2006) . These mixed results therefore underscore the need for a more rigorous examination of how school engagement trajectories may differ as a function of race or ethnicity.",

In support of this argument, social environments that are sensitive to adolescents' developmental needs (e.g., relatedness, autonomy) have been associated with increased achievement motivations, behaviors, and emotions, whereas environments that are at odds with the developmental needs of young adolescents have been associated with a decline in academic achievement and engagement (Eccles et al., 1993) . However, such work has primarily addressed the middle school years only and has focused on a limited range of school characteristics. Our third goal is to investigate whether social supports modify the shape of individuals' trajectories of school engagement across the secondary school years.",

These proximal processes such as interpersonal relationships and social support can either promote or hinder adolescents' ability to achieve desired outcomes (Bowen, Rose, Powers, & Glennie, 2008) . By and large, the literature suggests that positive social support will facilitate school engagement, particularly if the social partners encourage engagement. However, few studies have looked at different sources of social support in relation to different dimensions of school engagement, and no studies have looked at whether social support can protect against the normative declines in school engagement over the course of adolescence.",

Teacher social support predicts a range of indicators of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement (Wang & Holcombe, 2010) . Students who feel supported socially by teachers tend to exhibit greater compliance with a teacher's expectations, which, in turn, should reduce their involvement in distractive and deviant behaviors (Birch & Ladd, 1997; Garnefski & Diekstra, 1996) . Increased teacher social support also leads to increases in students' liking of school and improves students' achievement outcomes (Roeser, Eccles, & Sameroff, 1998) . Students who perceive their teachers to be caring report feelings of ''school belongingness'' (Roeser, Midgley, & Urdan, 1996) as well as increased interest and enjoyment in school (Wentzel, 1998) . In addition, when students feel socially supported by teachers, they are more likely to focus on mastery goals as well as experience lower levels of task engagement anxiety (Stipek, 2002) .",

Students with positive peer relationships at school are more behaviorally and emotionally engaged in school (Garcia-Reid, 2007) . In contrast, peer rejection increases the risk for misconduct, and lower participation and interest in school (French & Conrad, 2001) . Although few studies have looked at the role of peer social support on cognitive engagement, there is evidence to suggest that adolescents develop both confidence and competence in discussing points of view and critiquing each other's work when they feel peer acceptance for academic accom-plishment (Guthrie & Wigfield, 2000) .

Adolescents from supportive homes are more likely to be involved in prosocial activities, to be interested in and actively participate in school, and to avoid getting into trouble at school (Anderson, Sabatelli, & Kosutic, 2007; Wang, Dishion, Stormshak, & Willett, 2011) . Firm but receptive parenting is positively connected to adolescents' academic engagement and success, whereas hostile parenting is associated with poorer academic grades and task oriented beliefs and behaviors (Furrer & Skinner, 2003; Wolley & Bowen, 2007) .

For example, although girls and boys perceive different levels of support from teachers and parents in school, teacher and parental support has similar positive effects on academic adjustment for both genders (Rueger, Malecki, & Demaray, 2010) . Research suggests that boys are more likely to base their friendships around shared tasks while girls are more apt to establish intimacy in their friendships (McNelles & Connolly, 1999) . Girls tend to seek social support as a coping strategy, whereas boys tend to adopt avoidance as a coping strategy (Frydenberg & Lewis, 1993) . These findings suggest that peer social support might play a more significant role in school engagement of girls than boys.",

Participants were recruited from 23 schools in a single large and ethnically diverse county near Washington, DC. A total of 1,961 families expressed an interest in the study by signing a form permitting use to contact them. A subsample of 1,472 families was selected to participate on the basis of a stratified sampling procedure designed to obtain a representative sample of families from each of the 23 middle schools. To examine sampling bias, the district provided selected data on all students in the district during the study years (N = 25,627), including students who joined the school system partway through the year and those from whom we did not receive parental consent. Cook and his colleagues evaluated the differences between our sample and the data for the entire district. They found only two significant differences across a full range of sociodemographic and school achievement data: Our sample has a small underrepresentation of males and students who were receiving subsidized lunches; these differences amounted to less than 0.1 of a standard deviation. Thus, although not a random sample, very little systematic bias was evident in a comparison of this sample and the larger full community sample from which the participants were drawn and it did not lead to nonrepresented values at the extreme of ranges (see Cook, Herman, Phillips, & Setterstein, 2002, for details) .",

The Level 1 model (within-person) described individual change over time in adolescents' engagement outcomes. The Level 2 model (between person) described how these individual changes vary by demographic characteristics. To answer our three research questions, we conducted the following steps. First, we examined the empirical growth trajectories for all adolescents over time in order to identify an appropriate Level 1 model to describe the growth trajectories of individual adolescent. After testing a variety of possible specifications, we found that the best fitting Level 1 specification for school engagement included linear components only.",

Only the significant timevarying predictors were selected to move into the next phase of the model-building process. We then simultaneously entered all significant predictors into the Level 1 equations in order to examine the associations between changes in social support and changes in school engagement, controlling for demographic characteristics (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992) . The three time-varying social support variables were grand mean centered, which ensured that adding these variables did not change the meaning of the other coefficients in the model (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) . In addition, three variables representing each adolescent's mean over time for social support from teacher, peer, and parent (7th-11th grades), centered around the grand mean, were added into the Level 2 equations. By doing so, both the within-person relations between social support and school engagement (Level 1) and the between-person differences in initial status and growth in school engagement associated with social support (Level 2) were examined. As a last step, we tested cross-level interactions between the Level 2 adolescent characteristics and each of the timevarying predictors. This step was undertaken to determine whether certain characteristics of the adolescent (gender and race or ethnicity) moderated the associations between social support and school engagement outcomes. All two-way interactions among the three social support sources in the prediction of adolescents' school engagement were also examined.",

Table 1 provides the means, standard deviations, and correlations for each domain of the social support and the school engagement outcomes. Among the findings, teacher social support, peer social support, and parent social support were positively correlated with each other, and all of them were positively correlated with school compliance, participation in extracurricular activities, school identification, and subjective valuing of learning, with the exception that peer social support was negatively associated with school compliance.",

Effect of social support on school compliance. Increases in social support from teachers and parents were related to higher school compliance from 7th to 11th grades (see Table 2 , Model 6). The standardized effect sizes (d), calculated according to Raudenbush and Xiao-Feng (2001) , suggest that a standard deviation increase in teacher social support and parental social support was linked to a reduced rate of decline of 0.37 and 0.41 SD in adolescents' school compliance, respectively. Thus, such support protected against the normative rate of decline in school compliance. However, contrary to our hypothesis, a standard deviation increase in peer social support was related to a faster decrease of 0.28 SD in school compliance. There were no gender or racial or ethnic differences in the associations between social support and school compliance. Teacher social support and parent social support had similar protective effects on adolescent school compliance, and none of the two-way inter-actions between the three time-varying social support predictors were significant.

We speculated in the introduction that the influence of peer social support on school engagement might vary depending on the type of peers one has. The negative association between peer social support and school compliance could reflect the impact of peers on different groups of adolescents. It is plausible that those adolescents who report low levels of school compliance are primarily getting negative input from their antisocial peer group, while those reporting more school compliance are adolescents who are getting largely positive encouragement for positive behaviors from the nondelinquent peer group. To investigate this possibility, we separated the sample into two groups based on the type of peers-positive peers or negative peers-they consider to be their best friends. Adolescents were categorized in the positive peer group if they reported having more good friends with prosocial values and in the negative peer group if they reported having more friends with antisocial values. We found a positive association between peer social support and school compliance for the group with positive peers (b = .036, p = .06, d = 0.42) and conversely a negative association between peer social support and school compliance for the group with negative peers (b = ).092, p < .001, d = 0.49).

Girls' engagement with school may reflect a greater concern on their part for academic performance, perhaps as a result of gender socialization processes and differential expectations of parents and teachers (Eccles, 2007; Wilkinson & Marrett, 1985) . For instance, parents tend to monitor girls' progress more closely, correct girls' mistakes, and make decisions for girls more than they do for boys (Bumpus, Crouter, & McHale, 2001) . Such practices may communicate to girls, more so than to boys, the importance of regulating their progress toward their goals, and putting effort into meeting their goals as a way to attend to parents. Similarly, teachers often respond differently to boys and girls in the classrooms in ways that may lead students to believe that certain behavior patterns associated with their gender are expected by their teachers (Eccles, 2007) . Girls may be expected to display more emotional connectedness to school than boys, whereas boys may believe that it is not socially acceptable to admit having high levels of connectedness to school (Bembenutty, 2007) . These gender biases and beliefs favoring girls may lead girls in the seventh grade to engage in school more than boys. However, our findings indicate that although girls experience higher levels of school engagement in the seventh grade, girls and boys experience similar decline rates on the three dimensions of school engagement. It therefore seems that these gender biases and beliefs do not prevent girls from disengaging from secondary school once they enter this system.",

The results may reflect both the populations being studied and the historical period in which the work was done. This study was conducted in a largely middle-class, majority African American county in the 1990s. Many of the African American families had moved into this county recently in response to expanded professional job opportunities in Washington, DC. The political systems in the county were largely controlled by African Americans. Thus, the youth had many examples of the benefits of education for adult occupational success. Thus, the African American youth in this study believe that education may pay off in terms of adult occupational opportunities (Eccles, Wong, & Peck, 2006) . In fact, the parents of the African American adolescents in this study stressed exactly this message (Gutman & Eccles, 2007) .",

Thus, African American students reported higher levels of getting into discipline problems at school at the start of the study. One possible explanation lies in differential timing of pubertal development in African American and European American populations (Michael & Eccles, 2003; Simmons & Blyth, 1987) : African Americans move through pubertal development at a slightly younger age than European Americans. Both Simmons and Blyth (1987) and Eccles et al. (1993) found that early maturing students engage in more school problem behaviors after the transition to junior high school than do on time or later maturing students. If this is true, then the racial or ethnic difference we found in initial rates of school problem behaviors might reflect racial or ethnic differences in pubertal maturation rates. To test this hypothesis, future studies should include indicators of pubertal development in order to be able to control for this possible confound with school transition effects. Another possible explanation lies in the experiences of racial discrimination at school. According to Wong, Eccles, and Sameroff (2003) , the African American students in this sample reported higher rates of racial discrimination at school in the seventh grade, and those students who reported higher rates of racial discrimination also reported higher rates of school problem behaviors. If this is so, then the small difference in reported compliance between the two groups in this study could reflect group differences in experiences of racial discrimination at school.",

As we expected, different sources of social support are not equally important in their impact on adolescents' school engagement, and the effect of these sources differed by the aspect of school engagement studied. Our results suggest that supportive teachers play a particularly important role in reducing the declines in school compliance, sense of school identification, and subjective valuing of learning at school across the secondary school years. Adolescence is a period when relationships with nonparental adults take on increased meaning because adolescents are seeking support and guidance from adults outside of the home (Murray, 2009; Roeser et al., 1998) . In often large and impersonal secondary school settings, teachers can support students' need for relatedness, as well as their positive engagement with school through maintaining good quality relationships with students and emphasizing a high level of care, respect, and appreciation in the interaction (Wentzel, 1998) . We find these results particularly important given the common stereotype that adolescents are most heavily influenced by their peers rather than the adults around them.",

It is noteworthy, however, that the impact of teacher social support on emotional and cognitive engagement was greater than peer social support. This pattern of findings suggests that the shift in adolescent social priorities toward peer relationships is not as universal as is often assumed to be true. Perceived support from both teachers and parents is an important buffer against the general declines in school engagement found during the secondary school years. Our results suggest that most adolescents continue to be influenced substantially by their teachers and parents when it comes to school engagement even though they may be tempted into misbehavior outside of the classroom by their peers (Smetana, Campione-Barr, & Metzger, 2006) .",

On average, there was a negative association between peer social support and school compliance-the greater the increase in peer social support, the greater the decrease in school compliance. However, this association differed when we broke the students into two groups based on the nature of their friends. The association between peer support and behavioral engagement was negative only for those youth who reported hanging out with antisocial friends. By contrast, this association was positive for youth with prosocial friends. Thus, the unexpected finding of a negative association between peer support and school compliance likely reflects the impact of different kinds of peers on different groups of adolescents. It is conceivable that those adolescents who report low levels of school compliance are primarily getting negative input from their antisocial peer group, while those reporting more school compliance are getting largely positive encouragement for behavioral engagement from their prosocial peer group. Future studies should include peer group as a possible moderator in order to control for differential peer effects on school engagement.",

As discussed by Luthar and McMahon (1996) , peer social support does not necessarily equate with affirmation by peer engagement in positive and socially acceptable behavior. Demands from the peer group may run counter to school rules. For instance, behaviors considered ''deviant'' by mainstream society may sometimes be endorsed by the peer group as effective ways to achieve personal goals and resolve conflict. Such behaviors may also be associated with relatively high prestige and status within the immediate subcultural group (Coie & Jacobs, 1993) . Accordingly, this type of support and comfort from one's peers may have negative consequences for behavioral outcomes. Our supplementary analyses support these suggestions. Furthermore, peer social support was a slightly stronger predictor of behavioral outcomes than both teacher and parent support. These findings are consistent with developmental research showing that during adolescence, peers may be more important social factors than nonfamilial adults on problematic school behavior (Wentzel, 1998) . Thus, across all of the behavioral components of school engagement, peers are just as likely to exert positive influences on adolescents as negative influences.",

This may reflect the nature of our sample discussed earlier. In addition, this finding may be the result of the higher base levels of school identification and value of learning in African American adolescents relative to European American adolescents. African American adolescents' higher initial status of school identification and subjective value of learning may allow peer social support to exert a stronger effect on them.

Although supportive qualities of interpersonal relationships were significant contributors to behavioral, emotional, and cognitive aspects of school engagement in the present study, we did not find interactions among the various sources of perceived social support as significant predictors of engagement outcomes. In other words, teachers, peers, and parents seem to play relatively independent roles in adolescents' development of school engagement. On the one hand, this pattern of results is consistent with the interpretation that the effects of having multiple sources of social support on school engagement are additive rather than compensatory (Cook et al., 2002; Furstenberg et al., 1999) . On the other hand, the fact that each source of influence makes an independent contribution also reflects the fact that one can benefit from the support available from an individual source even if support is not forthcoming from multiple sources. In terms of positive school behaviors, the youth most at risk are those who have little social support from their parents and teachers coupled with strong social support from their peers. In contrast, social support from one's teachers and parents can totally counteract the negative influence of peer support on positive behaviors. Thus, in psychological rather than statistical logic, one could conclude that social supports in one domain do compensate for lack of social supports in another domain.",

Overall, the influence of each source of social support depended in part on the engagement outcomes being studied. For promotion of school compliance, social support from teachers and parents had positive associations, but peer social support had both positive and negative influences depending on what type of peer groups adolescents affiliated with. For participation in extracurricular activities, both peer and parent support had a positive impact, whereas teacher support had no significant association. Social support from teachers, peers, and parents had a positive influence on school identification as well as the subjective valuing of learning at school. Therefore, we can conclude from the analyses reported here that research in the area of school engagement must include attention to the multiple social contexts with which adolescents interact and no single variable will fully or adequately explain the engagement outcomes; by extension, no single intervention will be able to promote adolescents' school engagement. Thus, interventions designed to target specific engagement outcomes need to account for different aspects of adolescents' social relationships and environment.",

Results from this study can inform the design and implementation of interventions to promote adolescents' school achievement and engagement. More recent trends in the prevention sciences have reflected growing interest in strength-based rather than deficit-based studies (Moore, Lippman, & Brown, 2004) . Strength-oriented approaches allow researchers and practitioners to reduce risk and promote youth assets (e.g., active engagement and social support). The present study supplements youth development research by examining the combined effects of multiple social influences from the school, peer group, and family on positive youth development.",

                "text": "Several limitations of this study and some caveats need to be noted. First, it is noteworthy that we collected information about parental and teacher social support via adult-report measures. The use of multiple informants to assess social processes provides a more comprehensive perspective of the social support. However, this study mainly relies on self-report information from adolescents to assess school engagement. Although bio-ecological theory posits that perceptions or experiences (rather than some notion of objective reality) are key to understanding individuals' efforts to adapt to their social contexts, future use of multiple sources of information (informants, teachers, and parents) and multiple methodologies (interviews, observations, surveys) can provide a more robust, valid method of identifying school engagement (Fredricks et al., 2004) . Second, the nonexperimental nature of this study limits our ability to eliminate the prospective reciprocal relations between social support and adolescent school engagement. It is possible that highly engaged adolescents are simply welladjusted individuals who also enjoy supportive relationships with their teachers and parents. Thus, researchers should examine the reciprocal nature of social support and adolescent engagement outcomes and conduct experimental trials to make causal inferences. Finally, the study identified the protective roles of specific aspects of social support on various objective indicators of adolescents' school engagement. However, little is known regarding processes in terms of how adolescents' perceived social support influences their engagement. While longitudinal analyses eliminate questions concerning the temporal precedence of effects, it does not exclude the alternative explanation that a third variable accounts for the relations between social support and adolescent engagement outcomes. Thus, future research examining mediators would extend our understanding of the processes underlying effects of social support.",

The study thus underscores the importance of studying development of school engagement within an ecological perspective (Brofenbrenner, 2005) . Social contexts in which adolescents are embedded work differently for adolescents of different genders and ethnicities. School engagement seems to be influenced by the proximal process in the form of interpersonal relationships and social support and by the resources that adolescents can draw on during this process of development. Advancing our knowledge about the complex processes and interactions of personal and contextual factors in school engagement can help teachers and parents create environments that support adolescents while they navigate challenges and barriers in their quest for school success and completion.",
