    "abstract": "The current study aimed to explore the concept of transition self-efficacy, which is defined as individuals' subjective evaluation of their ability to execute the actions required for a successful transition from elementary to middle school. The study followed a sample of 128 sixth-grade students for 2 consecutive years (before and after the school transition). A path analysis based on structural equation modelling revealed that the students' perceptions of the teachers' emphasis on mastery goal orientations predicted academic and social aspects of self-efficacy. The social aspect of self-efficacy in turn predicted changes in the students' emotional and behavioural engagement after the transition. The results were robust when we controlled for self-reported GPA and gender. An interaction between gender and aspects of self-efficacy was also observed. The findings emphasise the importance of transition self-efficacy for adaptive school transitions and provide evidence that teachers' goal emphases play a significant role in promoting self-efficacy. Most students across the globe experience at least one school transition during the sequence of their formal education. The implications of such transitions are still debated; some findings indicate a decline in student achievement, engagement and well",

Expectations of a positive transition have been found to significantly predict actual positive experiences (Waters, Lester, & Cross, 2014) , and findings have suggested that most students look forward to change schools, reporting positive and enjoyable experiences after such transitions (Chedzoy & Burden, 2005) . However, students' beliefs surrounding their ability to adequately adjust to new schools have received less attention. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the concept of transition self-efficacy (Bandura, 1994) . We sought to explore whether the concept of transition selfefficacy could be defined and measured as a combination of academic and social aspects, whether these aspects are explained by perceptions of teacher practices one year prior to the transition and whether these aspects can predict students' emotional and behavioural engagement after the transition. To address these research questions, we followed a sample of students for two consecutive school years, before and after the transition from elementary to middle school.",

A basic assumption in this theory is that people learn by observing and interpreting social contexts and cues. These cognitive perceptions thus act as mediators between contextual factors and personal behaviours. A key concept in human agency is self-efficacy, which is defined as an individual's subjective evaluation of his or her ability to successfully execute the actions required to perform a specific task well (Bandura, 1977 (Bandura, , 1994 . Research has suggested that self-efficacy is domain specific (Schunk & Pajares, 2009) ; hence, for example, a person can have different beliefs regarding his or her ability to learn a new language compared with his or her ability to solve mathematical equations or to successfully implement self-regulatory learning strategies (Usher & Pajares, 2008a) .",

These findings have prompted researchers to explore personal and contextual factors that may promote mastery goal orientations within educational settings. One factor explaining personal achievement goals is students' perceptions of teachers' goal emphases or classroom goal structures (Ames, 1992; Urdan, 2010) . A mastery goal structure is defined as a teacher's emphasis on the importance of deep learning, a preference for effort over performance and the acceptance of mistakes as part of the learning process. By contrast, a performance goal structure refers to a teacher's emphasis on actual performance, competition and comparisons among students. Studies have consistently indicated that perceived goal structures are associated with personal achievement goals (Urdan, 2010) .",

For instance, competence beliefs have generally been found to decline after school transitions and this decline is moderated by gender. In one study, boys were more affected by school transitions and reported a decline in their competence beliefs in relation to mathematics, whereas girls reported a slight increase (Chouinard & Roy, 2008) . Additional findings have suggested that students who exhibit a superior ability to transit to secondary school report a stronger decrease in their academic self-concept (Arens & Watermann, 2015) . By contrast, findings from a recent study of secondary school students in Hong Kong revealed a decline in students' self-concept in mathematics and an increase in their self-concept in English (as second language) over a period of three school years (King & McInerney, 2014) . Therefore, the effect of school transitions on self-efficacy and other self-concept beliefs remains indistinct, with some findings suggesting a negative effect and others reporting a null effect (see Symonds & Galton, 2014 , for a review).

The objective was to focus on the general aspect of students' perceived effort and behaviour in school, which may indicate their adaptive adjustment to school transitions. Educators and researchers often perceive enhancing students' engagement as an ultimate goal in itself; however, those students who attend to, participate in, make an effort in and enjoy learning tasks are also more likely to succeed in school and pursue higher education (Finn & Zimmer, 2012) .

Students are assigned to a homeroom, and the teachers move among classes.

To assess the goodness of fit for all the CFAs, we examined the ratio of the chi-square to its degrees of freedom (CMIN/dF), which is a good fit when it is less than 3; the comparative fit index (CFI) and the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), which should be close to .95; and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), which should be less than .08. We then determined whether the correlation pattern fits our theoretical model. For instance, we expected that a perceived mastery goal structure would be associated with transition self-efficacy, while a performance goal structure would not be. This step was followed by repeated analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) measures to examine the mean-level difference between the two aspects of transition self-efficacy while controlling for gender and self-reported GPA.",

Based on social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1994) , students' evaluations of their abilities to successfully cope with these challenges can be defined as transition self-efficacy; however, this concept has not been empirically explored in any previous studies. The current study aimed to investigate the concept of transition self-efficacy and to explore its possible antecedents and outcomes among elementary school students. The goal of this study was to identify aspects of transition self-efficacy and to determine whether classroom goal structures explain transition self-efficacy, which may in turn predict students' engagement after school transitions.",

As self-efficacy is domain specific and sensitive to contextual factors, people can exhibit high self-efficacy in one area and low self-efficacy in another area (Schunk & Pajares, 2009) . The findings from the current research support the idea that transition self-efficacy is an important construct for both academic and social aspects. These aspects were hypothesised based on previous research that suggested that students are concerned with their ability to adjust to new academic and social expectations after a school transition (Ashton, 2008; Ganeson & Ehrich, 2009) . The factor analysis procedure indicated that, despite the high correlation between the academic and social aspects of school transitions, students could distinguish between the two and provide different assessments of their abilities to cope with each aspect. Furthermore, students generally felt very confident in their abilities, with higher confidence levels observed for the social aspects of school transitions than for the academic aspects. The study provides initial validation of the transition self-efficacy scale that was developed. The construct validity of the scale was adequate, and the hypothesised mechanisms associated with transition self-efficacy were supported by the data. Further research is required to replicate these results and to examine them within various populations and cultural contexts. note: tM -perceived teacher emphasis on mastery goals (wave 1); tP -perceived teacher emphasis on performance goals (wave 1); a-sE -transition academic self-efficacy (wave 2); s-sE -transition social self-efficacy (wave 2); Emotional -emotional engagement after school transition (waves 1 + 3); Behavioural -behavioural engagement after school transition (waves 1 + 3). * p < .05; ** p < .01; *** p < .001; only significant paths are presented.",

When students perceive that their teacher encourages learning and understanding instead of achievement, emphasises self-improvement instead of social comparisons and is patient in addressing students' mistakes (i.e. he/she provides a mastery goal structure; e.g. Kaplan, Middleton, Urdan, & Midgley, 2002; Urdan, 2010) , these perceptions predict higher levels of transition self-efficacy among students. Teachers who create a mastery-oriented climate in the classroom can increase students' confidence in their abilities to achieve the expected goals. In other words, if the teacher expects students to put forth effort and improve their skills based on intrapersonal standards, then students have more opportunities to meet this expectation instead of attempting to outperform others. The performance goal structure had no effect on transition self-efficacy; however, previous findings have demonstrated that this structure can impair students' crucial learning processes (Kaplan & Maehr, 2007; Schwinger & Stiensmeier-Pelster, 2011) .",

Students who felt more competent to establish new social relationships were also more likely to report higher engagement in middle school, perhaps because when students are less concerned about social challenges or difficulties in school, they may be more available to engage in academic tasks (Ganeson & Ehrich, 2009) . Therefore, acknowledging the social aspects of school transitions is important. Previous research has suggested that social and relational factors become salient before and after school transitions (Pratt & George, 2005) , and our study demonstrates that these factors are also related to academic adjustment. If social aspects become more prominent and challenging after a transition, then we can speculate that those who are more confident in their ability to cope with these challenges can maintain more adaptive functioning in other domains. In contrast, for those who do not feel confident in their social abilities, efforts to obtain and sustain social relationships may result in decreased academic engagement.",

First, because the effect sizes ranged from low to moderate, other factors should be considered antecedents of transition self-efficacy. Although a perceived goal structure in the classroom can be considered a vigorous indicator of the educational climate (Patrick et al., 2011) , it is certainly not the sole predictor of transition self-efficacy. Based on the literature on the sources of self-efficacy, we can speculate that peer influences, family support and additional teaching practices influence these beliefs (Chen & Usher, 2013; Usher & Pajares, 2008b) . For example, if a student is encouraged to believe in his ability to make new friends and has siblings who have already experienced a successful school transition, he is more likely to exhibit high self-efficacy regarding the expected transition. Similarly, students who receive more assistance and support after the transition are expected to experience a better adjustment (Evangelou et al., 2008) . Although all students in the current study transitioned to the same middle school, exploring differences among specific teachers may enhance our understanding of school transition effects. This rationale may inspire future studies that aim to advance our understanding of the transition self-efficacy construct.",

However, future research could explore this assertion by including a more general self-efficacy measure for comparison. Furthermore, the scales in this study are based on self-report measures that represent subjective perceptions of contextual factors (Fulmer & Frijters, 2009) . Selfreport measures were chosen based on the social-cognitive theoretical paradigm, which posits that subjective self-perceptions mediate the relationship between contextual factors and behavioural or emotional outcomes (Bandura, 2001) . Hence, students' perceptions of their teachers' practices rather than their actual actions constitute the proximal predictor of students' attitudes and behaviours (Kaplan, Gheen, & Midgley, 2002) . Additional support for students' self-reported levels of engagement is found in the significant correlation between the students' and teachers' reports of emotional and behavioural engagement (Skinner et al., 2009) .",
