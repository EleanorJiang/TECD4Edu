High school students, for example, reach the age at which education is no longer compulsory, and the extent to which students maintain a sense of belonging at school may predict whether or not they leave high school prematurely, a decision that can have life-long social and economic implications (Finn, 1989; Rouse & Kemple, 2009) . Despite the importance of school belonging during this developmental period, most research has been conducted with children and early adolescents, leaving school belonging among middle and late adolescents relatively unexplored (Liu & Lu, 2011; Witherspoon & Ennett, 2011) .",

Although findings from early adolescence suggest that students may become progressively less connected to school over time, key differences between early and middle to late adolescents suggest that declines in school belonging that occur in middle school may not continue into high school (Anderman, 2003; Witherspoon & Ennett, 2011) . Furthermore, although school belonging is often found to be associated with academic achieve-ment and values (Pittman & Richmond, 2007; Roeser, Midgley, & Urdan, 1996) , there are some inconsistencies in these findings (Booker, 2006; Dotterer, McHale, & Crouter, 2007; Liu & Lu, 2011; Singh, Chang, & Dika, 2010) .",

This longitudinal study was specifically designed to investigate whether school belonging tends to decline over the course of high school and whether high school students' school belonging translates into higher academic achievement and motivation. In examining school belonging, we focused on students' social and emotional connection with their academic institutions or the people within their academic institutions. Other researchers have examined differently named constructs (e.g., school identity, school connectedness, and emotional engagement) that, despite their names, tap essentially the same concepts. In the review that follows, therefore, we include work that focuses on students' social and emotional connections to school, regardless of the exact nomenclature. early adolescence (Anderman, 2003; Anderman & Anderman, 1999) . In childhood, when students are in elementary school, reports of school belonging tend to be universally high (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, Friedel, & Paris, 2005) . As students enter adolescence, average school belonging tends to drop significantly, especially among students transitioning into middle school (Eccles et al., 1993) . Across the course of the early adolescence, school belonging generally continues to decline (Anderman, 2002; Ding & Hall, 2007) .",

A few studies have examined students' school belonging as they transition from middle to high school. These studies indicate that compared to the transition to middle school, changes in school belonging may be less normative when transitioning to high school (Benner & Graham, 2007) . Most studies that have examined school belonging beyond the high school transition have relied on cross-sectional data. Although some of these cross-sectional studies suggest that school belonging generally declines over the course of high school, others suggest that school belonging remains stable or increases slightly (Meeus & Dekovic, 1995; Whitlock, 2006) . Witherspoon and Ennett (2011) conducted one of the few studies that has employed longitudinal data among high school students; they found that school belonging decreased during the transition to and 1st year of high school, but then increased slightly across the rest of high school. This study, however, focused only on students from predominately rural counties. Thus, unlike in childhood and early adolescence, it is not clear whether there are general trends in school belonging across middle and late adolescence. Unfortunately, even turning to an examination of the theoretical reasons why school belonging declines across development offers equivocal predictions for what might happen in late adolescence.",

As students enter adolescence, for example, their developmental needs for autonomy and positive relationships with nonparental adults increase (Eccles, Early, Fraser, Belansky, & McCarthy, 1997) . Simultaneously, however, the structures of most adolescents' schools tend to provide authoritarian rule enforcement and few opportunities for the development of teacher-student relationships (Eccles et al., 1993; Roeser, Eccles, & Sameroff, 2000) . As indicated earlier, school belonging does tend to decrease after middle school matriculation, and it continues to decrease over the course of middle school (e.g., Finn, 1989; Whitlock, 2006) . This decline is especially steep among students who report that their needs are not met and, importantly, school belonging declines less or not at all among the minority of middle school students who report that their needs are met by their school environments (Anderman, 2003; Brewster & Bowen, 2004; Eccles et al., 1997) .",

Like middle schools, high schools tend to be large and have fully departmentalized curriculums, both of which can attenuate feelings of autonomy and student-teacher relationships (Alfaro, Uma\u00f1a-Taylor, & Bamaca, 2006; Davis, 2003; Gilman & Anderman, 2006) . Differences between middle and high school environments and students, however, may result in better fit between high school environments and students' developmental needs. Compared to middle schools, for example, high schools tend to offer students more choice in coursework and have more support staff (e.g., guidance counselors), meeting students' needs for autonomous decision making and supportive adult relationships (Eccles & Roeser, 2005; Hargreaves, Earl, & Ryan, 1996) . High school students, themselves, may need less support from their school environment given that they are older and more mature, have already successfully navigated one major school transition, and generally have already entered puberty and therefore are not simultaneously navigating biological as well as social transitions (Anderson, Jacobs, Schramm, & Splittgerber, 2000; Hargreaves et al., 1996) . Thus, even considering stage-environment fit, research does not offer a clear prediction for whether to expect normative changes in school belonging across the course of high school.",

As mentioned earlier, the current study examined the within-person associations between school belonging and academic values. We included two types of academic values that are likely to be very relevant for high school studentsintrinsic value (i.e., the extent to which students enjoy school) and utility value (i.e., the extent to which student's feel that school is useful to their current or future lives; Eccles, 1983 ).",

Although broad social groups (e.g., gender and ethnicity) comprise heterogeneous individuals, if typical school environments tend to differentially meet the needs of students from different groups, group membership may be associated with average differences in school belonging (Goodenow, 1993b; Smith & Tyler, 1997) .",

Questions remain, therefore, as to whether there are gender or ethnic differences in school belonging in high school and whether these differences change over time. Beyond differences in mean levels of school belonging, it is also possible that there are group differences in the associations between school belonging and other outcomes. According to the concept of functional substitution, for example, any resource is especially influential among students who have fewer resources in general (Mirowsky & Ross, 2003) . Thus, it is possible that school belonging is associated with achievement only among students who face increased risk of academic challenges (Crosnoe, Johnson, & Elder, 2004; Goodenow & Grady, 1993) . To the extent that boys may have lower general school belonging or ethnic-minority students may face negative stereotypes at school, any school belonging that these students are able to maintain in spite of these challenges may be especially associated with achievement. Indeed, there is some evidence that although school belonging is associated with higher intrinsic motivation among all students, this association is especially strong among students from Latin American backgrounds (Bennett & Sani, 2003) .",

Students' open-ended reports of their mothers' and fathers' jobs were coded into the following five categories: unskilled, semiskilled, skilled, semiprofessional, or professional. These four measures (mother's and father's education and mother's and father's occupation) were each standardized and summed to provide an overall index of SES.

Initial analyses were conducted to examine whether or not participants differed according to the number of years in which they participated. Because participants could potentially enter the study during different years of data collection, a variable was created to indicate the percentage of possible years each participant took part in the study. A participant who began the study in 9th grade, for example, had 4 possible years, whereas a participant who began the study in 10th grade had only 3 possible years. On average, participants took part in the study in 93.5% (SD = 13.9) of their possible years.

In this equation, school belonging was centered at each individual's mean, and all other predictors were uncentered.

The positive association between school belonging and utility value was significant for both genders but was stronger for male students than it was for female students. Follow-up tests of Gender \u00d7 Ethnicity interactions were nonsignificant, indicating that the gender difference in the association between school belonging and utility value was consistent across students from Latin American, Asian, and European American backgrounds. We conducted one final set of analyses in which we controlled for GPA at Level 1. These analyses allowed us to determine whether or not the associations between school belonging, intrinsic value, and utility value would remain significant even after controlling for individuals' year-to-year variation in academic achievement. As shown in Table 4 , results indicated that school belonging's positive within-person associations with intrinsic and utility value of education remained significant even when controlling for students' GPA in each given year. In other words, these analyses indicated that even after statistically equating students' GPA within a particular year of high school, students' school belonging in that year is associated with higher academic values in that same year. These results suggest that school belonging is associated with a higher level of academic motivation among adolescents as compared to their equally achieving peers.",

Perhaps this is one reason why previous studies have not offered consistent findings for how school belonging changes across the course of high school (e.g., Note. Gender was dummy coded such that males = 0 and females = 1. All ethnicity variables were dummy coded such that students from European backgrounds were the comparison group. School belonging was centered at each individual's mean; all other predictors were uncentered. *p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001. Meeus & Dekovic, 1995; Whitlock, 2006) . The current results, in contrast, are drawn from longitudinal data, with the same group of students reporting their school belonging in each of the 4 years of high school. These data, therefore, are more likely to accurately represent trajectories of school belonging and, as such, add to the school belonging literature. The current study suggests that, unlike in middle school, normative declines in school belonging do not continue into high school. Among male students especially, school belonging remains remarkably stable, and although school belonging does decline among female students, the magnitude of this decline across all 4 years of high school is only about 7% of ninth-grade values. These findings are in contrast to studies conducted with younger students that find larger drops in school belonging across the course of middle school among both boys and girls. Anderman (2003) , for example, reported a 5% decline in school belonging across just a single year of middle school.",

Future research could more thoroughly test this idea by directly measuring students' needs, their school environments, and their school belonging across the course of high school. By measuring a variety of specific aspects of school environment, this research would allow us to determine which aspects of the school environment are beneficial for all students and which are especially beneficial for certain groups of students (e.g., boys or girls).",

Even after controlling for SES, gender, and ethnicity, significant variability in school belonging remained. This significant variability indicates that although, on average, boys' school belonging remained consistent and girls' declined, there may have been some students for whom these averages did not apply. There may be subgroups of girls, for example, for whom school belonging remained stable or increased, and there may be subgroups of boys for whom school belonging increased or decreased. Future research, therefore, will benefit by more thoroughly examining predictors of changes in school belonging, identifying protective factors associated with stability or increases in school belonging and risk factors associated with decreases in school belonging.",

Some researchers have suggested that ethnic minority students are at increased risk for academic disengagement, which could manifest as decreasing school belonging (Anderson et al., 2000; Nussbaum & Steele, 2007) . Our findings, in contrast, indicate that ethnic group membership alone is not associated with mean levels of school belonging or with changes in school belonging across high school. On average, students from Latin American, Asian, and European backgrounds reported similar levels of school belonging in ninth grade, and students from these three groups reported similar slopes of school belonging over the course of high school. As with our findings for gender, however, there is certainly within-group variability in school belonging that the current study was unable to capture, and there may be subgroups of students who are at risk of school disengagement. Our findings, however, argue for moving beyond ethnic group membership as a definition of risk (Catterall, 1998) . Future research should include more individual-level variables to examine predictors of school belonging among subgroups of students.",

Within-person analyses indicated that school belonging was not associated with achievement as measured by GPA, and this was true among boys and girls from Latin American, Asian, and European backgrounds. Although this null association between school belonging and GPA is consistent with some previous research (e.g., Dotterer et al., 2007; Gutman & Midgley, 2000) , it does seem to conflict with other research (e.g., Anderman, 2002; Kuperminc et al., 2008) . Unlike the current study, however, previous studies demonstrating associations between school belonging and GPA have been based on between-subjects analyses. Like these studies, we also found modest correlations between school belonging and GPA at the individual level (in the 11th and 12th grades). Between-subjects analyses, however, address whether or not individuals with high school belonging also have high GPA. Despite the inclusion of control variables in these analyses, the possibility remains that betweensubjects associations are artifacts of unmeasured variables. In contrast, the longitudinal within-person analyses employed in the current study assess whether or not year-to-year variations in a student's school belonging predict year-to-year variations in the same student's GPA. Within-person analyses, therefore, control for unmeasured factors that confound traditional, individual-level analyses. Thus, our study suggests that knowing how connected a student is to their school in a particular year does not predict their GPA for that same year.",

These results are consistent with school belonging work conducted with elementary and middle school students (Anderman, 2002; Battistich et al., 1995; Goodenow, 1993a) , indicating that the motivational benefits of school belonging continue into high school. Importantly, these associations held even after controlling for achievement. In other words, year-by-year changes in GPA were ruled out as a potentially confounding variable, indicating that even after statistically equating students' GPA within a particular year of high school, students' school belonging in that year was still associated with higher academic values in that same year. In other words, school belonging may help high school students continue to enjoy school and appreciate its usefulness, even when they are struggling academically. Given that these academic values are associated with increased educational persistence and graduation rates (Finn, 1989; Janosz, Archambault, Morizot, & Pagani, 2008) , the current study suggests that school belonging may be a promising intervention to reduce school dropout.",

Within particular school contexts, ethnicity may be associated with school belonging. Other school context variables such as urbanicity, busing policies, and safety also impact students' school belonging (Anderman, 2002) . Including a wide range of schools and directly measuring these context variables would allow us to determine if the observed patterns of school belonging in the current study hold across a variety of contexts. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the current study did not examine predictors of change in school belonging and, as such, does not offer any indication of what could be done to foster students' school belonging.
