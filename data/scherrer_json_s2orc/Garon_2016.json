    "abstract": "This study examined the associations between intrinsic motivation and achievement in mathematics in a sample of 1,478 Canadian school-age children followed from Grades 1 to 4 (ages 7-10). Children self-reported their intrinsic motivation toward mathematics, whereas achievement was measured through direct assessment of mathematics abilities. Cross-lagged models showed that achievement predicted intrinsic motivation from Grades 1 to 2, and from Grades 2 to 4. However, intrinsic motivation did not predict achievement at any time. This developmental pattern of association was gender invariant. Contrary to the hypothesis that motivation and achievement are reciprocally associated over time, our results point to a directional association from prior achievement to subsequent intrinsic motivation.

                "text": "The question as to whether intrinsic motivation predicts academic achievement has attracted much attention among education researchers and school professionals (Reeve, 2002) . Under self-determination theory (SDT), intrinsic motivation refers to being engaged in an activity because of one's inherent interest and pleasure for this activity rather than due to external contingencies (Ryan & Deci, 2000) . It is conceptualized as a natural catalyst for learning and achievement (Gottfried, 1985 (Gottfried, , 1990 Ryan & Deci, 2009) . Intrinsic motivation and academic achievement are seen as developmentally interlocked; intrinsic motivation lies at the core of self-determined activity (Ryan & Deci, 2000) and is expected to be reciprocally associated with achievement. According to SDT, intrinsic motivation is driven by two cognitive processes: (a) the degree to which individuals perceive that their action fulfills their need for autonomy and (b) the degree to which they feel effective in an activity. When the psychological needs of autonomy and competence are satisfied, intrinsic motivation and achievement are mutually reinforced; intrinsically motivated individuals will persist at the task, and thus will be more likely to achieve. Concurrently, higher achievement in a given activity (i.e., good marks in a school subjects) promotes perceived competence, which subsequently leads to greater intrinsic motivation in this activity.",

Mathematics skills are clearly important for overall academic and professional achievement (Duncan et al., 2007; Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development, 2010; Reyna & Brainerd, 2007) . Previous research suggests a positive association between intrinsic motivation (sometimes indexed as math interest) and achievement in mathematics across childhood and adolescence (Aunola, Leskinen, & Nurmi, 2006; Denissen, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2007; Lepper, Henderlong Corpus, & Iyengar, 2005; Viljaranta, Lerkkanen, Poikkeus, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2009; Wilkins & Ma, 2003) . However, the direction of this developmental association remains unclear. Consistent with SDT, some studies have shown that intrinsic motivation predicts achievement and learning behaviors in mathematics (Areepattamannil, Freeman, & Klinger, 2011; Gottfried, 1985; Murayama, Pekrun, Lichtenfeld, & vom Hofe, 2013; Spinath, Spinath, Harlaar, & Plomin, 2006) , but others did not (Bouffard, Marcoux, Vezeau, & Bordeleau, 2003; Marsh, Trautwein, L\u20ac udtke, Koller, & Baumert, 2005) . A few other studies found that intrinsic motivation and achievement in mathematics are reciprocally related over time (Aunola et al., 2006; Henderlong Corpus, McClintic-Gilbert, & Hayenga, 2009; Koller, Baumert, & Schnabel, 2001; Luo, Kovas, Haworth, & Plomin, 2011; Viljaranta et al., 2009) .",

                "text": "In addition to appearing inconsistent, previous findings were also tainted by features limiting their interpretation. First, intrinsic motivation has been measured in various ways in past studies; while some studies used a task-value scale in mathematics (Aunola et al., 2006; Viljaranta et al., 2009) , others used a multidimensional scale measuring challenge-seeking, independent mastery, and curiosity-driven engagement (Henderlong Corpus et al., 2009; Lepper et al., 2005) . Second, most studies did not specifically test for bidirectional associations, with only a few studies taking advantage of a longitudinal crosslagged design to more clearly document the direction of the association between intrinsic motivation and achievement (Luo et al., 2011; Marsh et al., 2005; Viljaranta et al., 2009) . Specifically, Marsh et al. (2005) found evidence for bidirectional associations between self-concept (or self-perceived ability) and achievement in mathematics, but not for intrinsic motivation and achievement. Bidirectional associations were found in Luo et al. (2011) , but using a combined score of intrinsic motivation and academic self-concept items. Intrinsic motivation and academic self-concept are clearly related (Guay et al., 2010) , but they should not be confounded as they imply self-agency versus self-description, respectively. As there is substantial evidence for bidirectional associations between academic self-concept and achievement (Guay, Marsh, & Boivin, 2003; Marsh et al., 2005) , the composite score may have blurred the pattern of associations. Finally, Viljaranta et al. (2009) clearly showed a bidirectional association between intrinsic motivation and achievement, but their study only used two data points to cover a short developmental period within the 1st year in school. While this period may set the stage for later intrinsic motivation and achievement, it is also important to document the nature of these associations in the following years of school. There is indeed a documented decline in intrinsic motivation for mathematics with age (Gottfried, Fleming, & Gottfried, 2001; Gottfried, Marcoulides, Gottfried, Oliver, & Guerin, 2007; Wigfield, Eccles, Schiefele, Roeser, & Davis-Kean, 2006) . This decline in motivation could be due to the growing challenges of mathematics compared to other school subjects (Smith, 2004; Stodolsky, Salk, & Glaessner, 1991) . This increased pressure to perform in mathematics, combined with an improved capacity to self-evaluate their competence with age (Boivin, Vitaro, & Gagnon, 1992 ) could increase the likelihood of reciprocal associations between intrinsic motivation and achievement in mathematics over time.",

Accordingly, intrinsic motivation toward mathemat-ics was defined as enjoyment and interest in that topic (Guay et al., 2010; Ryan & Deci, 2000) . Second, it used a longitudinal follow-up to conduct crosslagged analyses on intrinsic motivation and achievement in mathematics from school entry to Grade 4. Third, achievement in mathematics was operationalized through ageappropriate direct assessments of knowledge and abilities, rather than by indirect measures such as teacher assessments. Fourth, children were also assessed on their nonverbal cognitive abilities to precisely capture, through statistical control of fluid cognitive skills, the association between achievement and intrinsic motivation (Kytt\u20ac al\u20ac a & Lehto, 2008) . On the basis of SDT and previous research, we predicted that intrinsic motivation and achievement toward mathematics would be reciprocally related over time.",

As argued previously, a prominent explanation for this discrepancy is that most previous studies did not use a cross-lagged design and thus, did not specifically test for reciprocal associations. Of those that did, one failed to find a specific association for intrinsic motivation (Marsh et al., 2005) , and another found a bidirectional association, but for a score combining intrinsic motivation and academic self-concept in mathematics (Luo et al., 2011) . Only in Viljaranta et al. (2009) was a clear bidirectional association revealed, but only over a short period in the 1st school year. It is thus possible that an early bidirectional association exists, but only over a short period of time. The present results challenge the view that intrinsic motivation naturally leads to higher achievement in mathematics, and thus raise questions regarding the theoretical assumptions underlying this predictive association. Contrary to SDT tenets, intrinsic motivation did not translate into higher achievement in mathematics. According to SDT, this directed link is expected when the needs for autonomy and competence are fulfilled. It may be that the typical learning process in mathematics in the early years of school is mostly driven by school contingencies, such as mandatory schedule, homework, and learning exercises; these conditions may create an unfavorable context for self-determined activity and thus for intrinsic motivation to bring about consequent learning behavior in mathematics. The possible interplay of these contextual factors should be investigated further in future research.",

The simplest explanation for this predictive association is that achievement in mathematics is self-reinforcing and thus brings about an increase in intrinsic motivation. A more stringent test of SDT would involve testing the mediating role of self-concept in mathematics in this predictive association. Indeed, SDT posits that academic self-concept develops with integrated feedback from past and actual school evaluations. Accordingly, it has been associated with achievement and engagement in activities, as well as with intrinsic motivation in mathematics (Marsh et al., 2005) . However that may be, to put these findings in perspective, one has to consider the differential stability observed for intrinsic motivation versus achievement in mathematics over the primary school years. Indeed, an enduring feature of the present results is that individual differences in mathematics achievement were highly stable despite variation in the measures. In contrast, individual differences in intrinsic motivation toward mathematics were initially moderate, but became increasingly stable during elementary school. Clearly, intrinsic motivation in mathematics behaved as a developmental construct; it was more likely to change at school entry, but became progressively more crystallized later in children development, partly due to previous achievement in mathematics.",

The present findings could mean that these practices may not be the best approach in the early school years (Cordova & Lepper, 1996; Wigfield & Wentzel, 2007) . However, we should refrain from concluding too hastily. The present study shows that intrinsic motivation does not lead to higher achievement in mathematics, but does not speak specifically to the impact of intervention on intrinsic motivation and achievement. It may still be possible to improve intrinsic motivation through intervention, but at the population level, intrinsic motivation does not \"naturally\" increase achievement in mathematics. It could also be that within the population, the relation between intrinsic motivation and performance in mathematics differs as a function of ability level (Cleary & Chen, 2009; J\u00f5gi, Kikas, Lerkkanen, & M\u20ac agi, 2015) or the nature of the mathematics skills (Cerasoli, Nicklin, & Ford, 2014) . For instance, intrinsic motivation more likely predicts the quality (i.e., complex task that seeks more skills and commands personal investment) than the quantity (i.e., task with less personal cognitive investment) of achievement (Cerasoli et al., 2014) . Further research is needed to verify whether this pattern can be reproduced using different samples, different measures of intrinsic motivation and achievement, and different types of motivation (see Ryan & Deci, 2009) . Future research should also examine whether the actual results may be generalized to other school subjects, as well as to other school period (Green, Martin, & Marsh, 2007; Marsh et al., 2005) . Most importantly, future research should conduct experiments, ideally randomized controlled trials, to test if intrinsic motivation can be fostered in young children, and if so, to what extent and how it leads to increased achievement.",

The same could be said about the age range; the findings covered the early years of primary school and may only be relevant to that school period. Third, the present study defined intrinsic motivation as a combination of interest and enjoyment. However, enjoyment may also be seen as part of academic interest (Krapp, Schiefele, & Winteler, 1992) . It would have been relevant to distinguish academic interest from intrinsic motivation. Unfortunately, the focused nature of the motivation scale did not allow this distinction. Finally, the statistical fit comparison between the nonconstrained and the constrained cross-lagged models was based on the chi-square goodness of fit. This statistical index is sensitive to sample sizes (see Bentler & Bonett, 1980) , so that the fit deterioration of the constrained model, in comparison to the nonconstrained model, could partly be a consequence of the sample size.",
