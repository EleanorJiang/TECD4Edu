We analyzed the first 3 waves of the Korean Educational Longitudinal Study 2005 data (Y. Kim et al., 2007), which followed students from Grade 7 to Grade 9 in middle school. Compared with the other 2 social agent groups, support from parents predicted the widest variety of adolescent motivation and achievement indexes. Parental emotional support was most beneficial, predicting stronger mastery goals, weaker performance-avoidance goals, lower test anxiety, and higher academic achievement than any other type of support. Parental academic support functioned as a double-edged sword, predicting not only stronger mastery goals but also stronger performance-approach goals, stronger performance-avoidance goals, and higher test anxiety. Achievement pressure from teachers had the same predictive relationships but was weaker in strength. Perceived emotional support from teachers was not as effective as that from parents in predicting adolescent motivation achievement; however, perceived academic support from teachers was helpful for adolescents in predicting stronger mastery goals. Support from peers worked as a buffer against maladaptive motivation, predicting weaker performance-avoidance goals and lower test anxiety. Mastery goals mediated the relationship between social support and academic achievement, whereas performance-approach goals and performance-avoidance goals mediated the relationship between social support and test anxiety. The same patterns emerged consistently for all 3 years at middle school.",

Patrick, Ryan, & Kaplan, 2007; Wentzel, 1998) , existing studies have customarily assessed perceived support from these social agents as a unitary construct without distinguishing between the support provided by different figures. However, the support from a particular social agent may be more consequential than support from other agents in shaping motivation and performance during adolescence.

Perceived support that is mainly academic in nature, such as providing study tips to adolescent students, is expected to have a different effect on their motivation and performance than would purely emotional support, such as providing empathy and encouragement. It will also be helpful to learn the psychological mechanisms through which social support results in concrete academic outcomes. Wentzel (1998) suspected that academic motivation in the form of interest and achievement goals is one likely mediator linking social influence to academic performance. H. Patrick et al. (2007) likewise tested self-efficacy and various achievement goals as potential mediators in the relationship between social support and academic achievement. We set out to examine the role of achievement goals in this research.",

Nonetheless, it is possible that social support plays a more determining role in the academic motivation and achievement of East Asian adolescents because of their interdependent self-construal and proclivity toward social harmony (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) .

The study by Wentzel (1998) is one such investigation. She assessed family cohesion, perceived support from teachers, and perceived support from peers in a group of middle school students. Pertinent to this study are her findings that (a) different social agents did not interact in terms of the perceived support they provided, but rather contributed independently to student motivation; and (b) the perceived support from each social agent predicted slightly different motivational outcomes. In particular, family cohesion positively predicted school interest and mastery goal orientation and negatively predicted performance goal orientation. Perceived support from teachers positively predicted school interest, class interest, and the pursuit of prosocial goals, whereas perceived support from peers positively predicted only the pursuit of prosocial goals.",

Personal adjustment (a composite measure of the relationship with parents, interpersonal relations, selfreliance, and self-esteem) was positively predicted by the support from parents when measured 6 months later. Parental support also negatively predicted clinical maladjustment (a composite of social stress, anxiety, somatization, atypicality, and locus of control) and emotional symptoms (a composite of anxiety, social stress, depression, sense of inadequacy, interpersonal relations, and self-esteem) when assessed 1 year later. Support from classmates was also a negative predictor of emotional symptoms after 1 year. Support from teachers or close friends did not predict the adjustment indexes of adolescents in the presence of support from other sources. Support from their school, however, negatively predicted school maladjustment (represented by negative attitudes toward and dissatisfaction with school, teachers, personnel, and structures within the school) when assessed 1 year later.",

The researchers compared the predictive utility of the representations of relationships with parents, teachers, and friends in terms of student motivation at middle school. Here, the representation of relationships refers to a generalized view of interpersonal relationships that organizes ongoing experiences and interactions with significant others. Teacher representation significantly predicted students' positive coping, relative autonomy, perceived control, and positive affect toward school. However, it did not predict self-esteem or identity integration. Friend representation, on the other hand, predicted only self-esteem and not any of the school-relevant outcomes. Consistent with the results of Demaray et al. (2005) , parent representation significantly and more strongly predicted both schooland self-relevant outcomes than did the other two representations.",

Parental support is expected to be particularly influential in the motivation and achievement of Korean adolescents-the participants in the present sample. In addition to elements of East Asian cultural heritage, such as interdependent self-construal (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) , there are sociocultural and historical factors that are indigenous to Korean culture and society. These include the Confucian notions of filial piety and familism, which require children to pay due respect to and look after the elderly in the family; the Confucian educational system, which has traditionally rewarded successful performance in nationwide examinations with coveted positions in government agencies or entrance to prestigious universities; and the ensuing educational fervor and academic elitism (Bong, Kim, Shin, Lee, & Lee, 2008; Park & Kim, 2006) . These factors lead Korean adolescents to feel a strong sense of obligation to recompense their parents with high scholastic achievement for the support they have given and the sacrifices they have made. Perceived parental support thus functions as a source of heightened academic motivation.",

Surprisingly, however, few studies have tested the support from parents, teachers, and peers separately.

In the past, investigators have assessed social support as either a global construct or a more specific construct that emphasized a particular type of support. Social support, belongingness, positive relationships, or teacherstudent relationships (e.g., Wentzel, 1998) are examples of the former; emotional support, informative support, pedagogical caring, or intimacy (e.g., Ahmed, Minnaert, van der Werf, & Kuyper, 2010; Berndt, 1992) are examples of the latter. Neither, however, adequately represents the complex nature of the support adolescent students receive at home or school. Perhaps for this reason, previous research into social support has been criticized for its failure to clearly establish the various functions social support plays in the interpersonal relationships between students and significant others (Winemiller, Mitchell, Sutliff, & Cline, 1993) .",

Perceived emotional support is the belief that significant others respect students as individuals and attend to their feelings and needs, by expressing empathy and concern about their personal well-being (Ahmed et al., 2010; Johnson, Johnson, & Anderson, 1983; H. Patrick et al., 2007) .

Despite the recognition that the two types of support may play different roles in student motivation and performance (H. Patrick et al., 2007; Wentzel, 1997) , direct evidence of this is scarce. It is still common practice to measure social support as a single construct and, even when subcomponents of support are assessed separately, excessively strong correlations between these subcomponents often force researchers to merge them into a single factor. Because we analyzed a longitudinal database in which perceived academic support and emotional support from parents and teachers were assessed independently for multiple years, we were able to study the simultaneous influence of the two types of social support on student motivation and achievement.

Adolescent members of society are the primary target of this achievement pressure because entering a leading university is an implicit prerequisite for improved employment opportunities and social recognition. Failing to do so is often followed by a stream of denied opportunities (Bong, 2003) . Korean adolescents thus normally spend an enormous amount of time studying and suffer from extreme stress and sleep deprivation (M. Lee & Larson, 2000; Yang, Kim, Patel, & Lee, 2005) . This stress can be summed up by the description of Korea as an \"examination hell\" (M. Lee & Larson, 2000) . Noting this, Korean educational researchers have attempted to evaluate the influence of achievement pressure on the academic motivation and learning of Korean students, demonstrating that parental achievement pressure relates positively to both test anxiety (e.g., Jeong, Chung, & Lee, 2009) and academic achievement (e.g., Hong & Lee, 2012) .

This theoretical stance agrees with that of Wentzel (1999) , who argued that the socialization experiences of children and adolescents with their parents, teachers, and peers shape their social and academic motivational processes, and these motivational processes lead students to particular academic outcomes, most notably academic achievement. This motivational mediation of social support has been clearly demonstrated in previous studies (H. Patrick et al., 2007; Wentzel, 1998) . In H. Patrick et al. (2007) , for instance, emotional support and the promotion of student interaction by teachers, in addition to the academic support of peers, predicted students' use of self-regulation strategies and task-related interaction, the latter of which, in turn, predicted academic achievement. Most importantly, all predictive paths from the support variables to self-regulation and task-related interaction were mediated by the students' mastery goals and academic self-efficacy, whereas the path from the peers' academic support to task-related interaction was mediated by the students' social efficacy.",

Second, both have been predicted by students' perceptions of social support and achievement pressure (Ahmed et al., 2010; Demaray et al., 2005; Goetz et al., 2006; Leung et al., 2010) , as well as students' personal achievement goals, in previous research (Bong, 2009; Church et al., 2001; Elliot & McGregor, 1999 ).

Mastery-oriented learners are more intrinsically motivated, feel more self-efficacious and less anxious, and reach higher levels of achievement compared with those who are less masteryoriented (Bong, 2009; Church et al., 2001; H. Patrick et al., 2007) . Conversely, when students perceive achievement pressure in the form of high academic demands from parents and teachers, competition among peers, and a focus on ability and evaluation, they are more likely to pursue performance-approach goals, performance-avoidance goals, or both. These goals differ in their implications for test anxiety and achievement; students with performance-approach goals occasionally experience heightened levels of test anxiety, but more frequently demonstrate stronger academic performance than students without such goals. Learners with performance-avoidance goals, in comparison, almost always exhibit lower intrinsic motivation, stronger test anxiety, and poorer academic performance (Church et al., 2001; Elliot & McGregor, 1999; Jiang et al., 2014; Middleton & Midgley, 1997) .

Social support-emotional support in particular-is also more important to women than men, a situation that leads to differences in the level of stress experienced and the type of coping strategies used by the two genders. Women find conflict in social relationships more stressful and seek more emotional support when in trouble than men do (Tamres, Janicki, & Helgeson, 2002) . All available evidence thus suggests that social agents and the support they provide are of potentially greater importance for girls than boys. Helsen, Vollebergh, and Meeus (2000) observed that perceived parental support decreased and perceived peer support increased between the ages of 12 and 16 years for both genders. Boys perceived consistently stronger support from parents than from peers during this period, whereas girls started to perceive stronger support from peers at around the age of 14. However, it was girls who benefitted more from perceived parental support when faced with emotional problems such as stress. In addition, although perceived parental support demonstrated a similar relationship with general psychological well-being for both girls and boys, its relationship with the emotional problems of girls was significantly more negative than it was with those of boys. In a similar vein, Goodenow (1993) found that teacher support correlated more strongly with the expectations for success in, and value attached to, specific school subjects among girls than it did among boys. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the motivation and achievement of the adolescent girls in this study would depend more heavily on the perceived support from adults, whereas those of the boys would be more affected by the perceived support from peers.",

By including these sources of social influence in a single study, we were able to compare the relative contribution of each in the prediction of adolescent academic motivation and achievement. Based on the characteristics of the sample used in our study and previous findings that parents wield significant influence over a wide variety of adjustment indexes for adolescents (Feldlaufer et al., 1988; Midgley et al., 1989) , one that is often stronger and wider-reaching than that of teachers or peers (Helsen et al., 2000; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 1998) , we hypothesized that parental support would exhibit a significant predictive pathway to test anxiety, academic achievement, and achievement goals. Because previous studies have indicated that support from teachers or schools tends to more accurately predict school-related variables than parental support does (Demaray et al., 2005; Ryan et al., 1994) , we expected that support from teachers might demonstrate stronger links to some of the variables under analysis. The limited evidence from previous studies made it difficult to generate hypotheses of any greater specificity.",

The literature suggests that both the source and the type of support affect adolescent motivation and achievement. In order to test this, academic support and emotional support from both parents and teachers were assessed, along with achievement pressure from teachers and perceived support from peers. Emotional difficulties in adolescents, such as anxiety, stress, or depression, are most effectively minimized when they perceive emotional support from their parents, whereas academic interest and achievement are most reliably improved by the academic support of teachers (Ahmed et al., 2010; Wentzel, 1998) .

We thus hypothesized, based on the observations of Demaray et al. (2005) , that it would negatively predict the test anxiety of adolescent students. Jiang et al. (2014) observed that the perceived achievement goals of parents and peers were more predictive of achievement goals in Korean adolescents than were those of teachers, suggesting that peer support might also predict students' adoption of particular achievement goals.

Our hypothesis of a negative relationship between teacher pressure and student achievement was tentative, however, because the few available studies on teacher achievement pressure have documented a nonsignificant link between the two (S. Kim & Oh, 2014; J. Lee, 2012) . We further hypothesized that achievement pressure from teachers would predict a student's adoption of performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals because of the strong focus on evaluation that achievement pressure shares with performance-oriented classroom goal structures (Church et al., 2001) . By simultaneously examining adaptive and maladaptive forms of social influence on adolescents, we aimed to clarify their contrasting natures and the motivational mechanisms by which they primarily operate.",

The normal age range for this cohort was from 13 years to 15 years and 11 months. We were particularly interested in this age group because Grade 7 in Korea is when students make the transition to middle school. Middle school adolescents are subject to evolving social relationships with their parents, teachers, and peers, rendering them an ideal sample with which to study the differing roles of social support from these multiple agents. They also start experiencing many changes in the classroom environment, such as an increased emphasis on grades and competition. Still, unlike Korean high school students, who (with few exceptions) suffer from immense achievement pressure and stress because of concerns about their imminent entrance into university, middle school students do not need to face these extreme challenges for a few more years. We conjectured that if adolescents indeed alter their academic motivation and performance by reacting to the source and type of social support that they receive, these differences would emerge more clearly among middle school students than among high school students.",

Because the same survey items were used repeatedly across different school years for each construct, we incorporated correlated error paths between the same items measured at various times to more accurately model construct relations (Pitts, West, & Tein, 1996) . This initial model demonstrated an acceptable fit, 2 (5545, N \u03ed 6089) \u03ed 37017.751, p \u03fd .001 (CFI \u03ed .910, TLI \u03ed .902, RMSEA \u03ed .031). However, modification indexes consistently suggested that the errors of three pairs of items were correlated. Upon inspection, we decided that each pair shared sufficient similarity in wording or content to justify the additional error covariance paths. Three error covariance paths were therefore added one at a time between the following item pairs: \"I cannot study because I am worried about test scores\" and \"I cannot concentrate on my test when I think about getting a bad score\" on test anxiety; \"My parents check my schoolwork and homework assignments\" and \"My parents personally teach me\" on perceived parental academic support; and \"My teacher understands students from students' point of view\" and \"My teacher never ignores students' opinions\" on perceived emotional support from teachers. The final measurement model displayed an improved fit for the data, 2 (5538, N \u03ed 6089) \u03ed 31064.017, p \u03fd .001 (CFI \u03ed .927, TLI \u03ed .921, RMSEA \u03ed .028).

The present study follows earlier studies that found perceived support that is primarily instrumental and informative in nature plays a different role to more personal and emotional support (Ahmed et al., 2010; Leung et al., 2010) . The current results also corroborated on a general level the observations of Wentzel (1998) and H. Patrick et al.

Also consistent with previous reports (Demaray et al., 2005; Helsen et al., 2000; Ryan et al., 1994; Wentzel, 1998) , perceived academic and emotional support from parents continued to contribute significantly to all areas of academic motivation and achievement assessed in this study, despite the decline in the quantity of parental support perceived by the students. Moreover, perceived support from parents, especially parental academic support, was a stronger predictor of achievement goals and test anxiety than perceived support from teachers or peers. Family is the basic social unit and a universal resource in the development of self and social relationships for adolescents across cultures. For adolescents in East Asian cultures, it takes on an even greater significance as a core element in their interdependent self-construal (U. Kim, Park, & Koo, 2004; Markus & Kitayama, 1991) . In a country like Korea, the feelings, desires, and opinions of parents are closely monitored and respected by the child, which amplifies parental influence. Supporting this view, parental support has been a stronger predictor of various psychological constructs, such as achievement motivation, levels of aspiration and stress, life satisfaction, and self-efficacy for academic achievement and self-regulated learning, than teacher or peer support among Korean middle school students (U. Kim & Park, 1999) . The importance of parental support, therefore, might have been greater in the present sample of Korean adolescents than in adolescent samples from Western countries.",

This is recommended practice because it guarantees that the relationships between the variables would not be unduly over-or underestimated because of differences in measurement specificity (Pajares, 1996) . Nevertheless, had the variables been assessed in reference to a particular subject area, perceived support from the teacher may have displayed a stronger predictive utility than parental support for student motivation and achievement in that subject. Peer influence also differs in its scope and strength, depending on the type of friendship in question (Berndt, 1992; Hartup & Stevens, 1997; Ryan et al., 1994) .

Adolescents who believed that they received strong emotional support from their parents were more likely to pursue mastery goals, less likely to pursue performance-avoidance goals, felt lower test anxiety, and attained higher levels of academic achievement. These results are consistent with previous research that has found the emotional support from parents reduces test anxiety (Leung et al., 2010) and encourages a stronger orientation toward mastery goals in learning situations (Wentzel, 1998) . It is especially noteworthy that the negative path from parental emotional support to test anxiety, and the positive path to academic achievement via mastery goals, emerged in 2 consecutive school years, the sophomore and senior years at middle school. We controlled for a host of preceding variables when estimating the paths in the sophomore and senior years. Furthermore, academic achievement was extremely stable throughout the middle school years, with stability coefficients as high as .92. The consistent nature of these significant relationships involving parental emotional support suggests that they are all the more reliable.",

Out of 13 teacher-related variables, teacher enthusiasm was the strongest predictor of students' intrinsic motivation and vitality. Its predictive power was stronger than more direct forms of teacher academic support such as promoting the relevance of learning materials, variation in the presentation method, and clarity of presentation. Kunter et al. (2008) showed that enthusiasm for teaching was a significant predictor of the instructional behavior of teachers, including closely monitoring student behavior, challenging students cognitively, and providing social support for students. This trend was observed both when instructor behavior was selfreported and when it was rated by students. In summary, the available evidence, including the present results and those of H. Patrick et al. (2001) , clearly indicates that enthusiastic teachers engage students in high-quality instructional processes, which positively supports their academic motivation and achievement.",

The fact that adolescent students were more likely to adopt the three types of achievement goal, even though these goals are of a contrasting nature, suggests that students received mixed messages from teachers who demanded that they study hard and attain a higher level of academic success. Previous research has already discovered that a strong focus on evaluation in a learning environment increases the likelihood of students pursuing performance-focused achievement goals (Church et al., 2001) . It is an irony that recognizing the pressure that their teachers exerted on them did not lead to students improving their academic successthe ultimate goal teacher pressure is intended to achieve.

The negative paths to performanceavoidance goals and test anxiety emerged consistently over two consecutive middle school years. Of the many positive benefits that peer support offers, the most critical may be that it acts as a stress buffer (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Hartup & Stevens, 1997) . Han, Park, and Lee (1997) demonstrated that although support from parents, teachers, and peers all negatively and indirectly predicted Korean adolescents' stress via increased feelings of self-worth, support from peers also directly predicted lower levels of stress. According to Wentzel (1999) , children who receive support from friends regulate their emotions and adjust to school more effectively, which explains why positive peer relationships are directly related to academic motivation and performance at school. In this sense, the observation that perceived support from peers discourages students from pursuing performance-avoidance goals is of particular importance. It has been demonstrated on a number of occasions that performanceavoidance goals predict a range of maladaptive processes and outcomes, including self-handicapping, avoidance of help-seeking, a weaker sense of self-efficacy, and poorer achievement (Elliot & McGregor, 2001; Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Urdan, 2004) , a pattern also observed in samples of Korean middle school students (Bong, 2009; Jiang et al., 2014) . The less likely a student is to adopt performance-avoidance goals, the more likely they are to avoid these maladaptive motivational processes.",

Unfortunately, the nature of the data set did not allow us to distinguish between the two types of peer support. Although it is unclear whether adolescent students distinguish between the academic and emotional support they receive from their friends and classmates as clearly as they would the support from their parents or teachers, it would be worthwhile to compare the relative benefits of each for student motivation and achievement in future studies. Wentzel (1998 Wentzel ( , 1999 has suggested that social and academic motivational processes mediate the association between students' interpersonal relationships and academic achievement. This mediating role of motivation was supported in this study through an analysis of achievement goals.

One is the consistently stronger correlation between mastery goals and academic achievement than that between performance-approach goals and academic achievement. When entered into the same regression equation with mastery goals, performance-approach goals were no longer significantly associated with achievement, despite the significant bivariate correlation. This proves that the correlation with academic achievement demonstrated by performance-approach goals was in fact the result of the variance it shared with mastery goals. The second possible explanation was offered by Brophy (2005) . He contended that the way performance-approach goal items are written renders it impossible for low-performing students to agree with the content. For items that ask whether a student's goal is to outperform others, the student needs a background of high academic achievement in order to answer affirmatively. Because we controlled for student achievement scores in the previous school year, nullifying the effect achievement history played in student responses, what remained in the measure of performance-approach goals was a variance not attributable to previous achievement. Unlike mastery goals, this unique variance in the performance-approach goals did not contribute to achievement gains.",

The stronger connection of mastery goals was consistent for all age groups across all types of achievement index. In another study (Bong, 2005) , mastery goals were again a stronger predictor of final examination scores in mathematics than were performance-approach goals among Korean high school girls. Neither study was able to establish whether this difference owes to Korean culture or the characteristics of mathematics as a subject. The present study demonstrated that the stronger effect of mastery goals on academic achievement is not restricted to mathematics. Whether it represents a cultural difference remains an important area of future research.",

Girls and boys in early adolescence may be more or less equally affected by social support until they reach late adolescence, during which time the significance attached to social support as perceived by the two genders begins to change. Several studies involving young adolescents have in fact found no gender differences in the manner in which perceived social support affects academic motivation and achievement (Midgley et al., 1989; Wentzel, 1998) . Significant gender differences emerged, however, in the temporal stability of all types of social support from all three social agents. In addition, the test anxiety, academic achievement, performance-approach goals, and performance-avoidance goals of girls were significantly more stable than those of boys. Considering that the achievement scores for both genders were extremely stable throughout middle school, these results raise the possibility that the perception and motivation of girls depend more heavily on their test scores than do those of boys. This is a cause for concern because it would be more difficult for parents, teachers, and peers to improve the perceptions of girls regarding the quantity and quality of support they receive from these significant others than to improve the same perceptions of boys.",

Owing partly to the Confucian belief (and post-Korean War observation) that education is an effective tool for quickly attaining wealth and social status, Korean parents have come to value education in the hopes of seeing their children succeed in society (Bong et al., 2008) , and the resulting strong focus on scholastic achievement is a source of parental academic support. Unfortunately, it is also a source of parental achievement pressure (Bong, 2003) . When coupled with the characteristics of parent-child relationships within a collectivistic culture, the high value parents place on education often functions as an impetus for Korean adolescents to achieve academically. In other words, they strive to recompense their parents for their support and sacrifice with strong academic performance.",

In addition, some of the relationships examined in the present study, particularly those associated with parents, were believed to be stronger in this sample of Korean adolescents than they would be in Western samples, owing to sociocultural factors specific to the Korean context. Despite these constraints, the support-motivation-outcome link observed in previous research was replicated in this study.

Changes in perceived social support from the previous year, however slight they may have been, significantly predicted changes in achievement goals, and these, in turn, significantly predicted changes in test anxiety and academic achievement.

Even though the influence of adults on children declines during adolescence, parents still appear to maintain the greatest influence on adolescent academic motivation and achievement. The present results suggest that emotional support from parents and peers can create a psychologically safe learning environment for adolescents, in which they experience stronger mastery goals, weaker performance-avoidance goals, lower test anxiety, and higher academic achievement. Classroom research conducted in Korea and the United States has already demonstrated that teaching styles that provide autonomy support are a positive predictor of classroom engagement and achievement in adolescent learners (Jang, Kim, & Reeve, 2012; Jang, Reeve, & Deci, 2010) . Students perceive autonomy support in the classroom when they \"feel understood\" by the teacher and the teacher \"conveys confidence\" in and \"encourages, listens, and understands\" them (Jang et al., 2012) -in other words, when the teacher provides emotional support.",

As the present results indicate, adolescent learners could perceive parental academic support as achievement pressure in disguise. Although this is a potential problem for all sources of academic support with regard to the learning environment, academic support from social figures other than parents appears to have a much lower risk of being perceived as academic pressure. Emotional support, regardless of the provider, seems to be free from this risk altogether. We thus recommend that parents be careful in their selection of language and behavior when they try to offer academic support to their children.",
