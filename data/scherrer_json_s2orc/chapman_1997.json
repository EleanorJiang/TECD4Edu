    "abstract": "Background. Although achievement-related self-perceptions are causally related to academic performance, it is not clear at what age this relationship starts to form, especially in terms of learning to read. Aims. The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine the emerging causal interplay between reading self-concept and beginning reading performance. Sample. One hundred and twelve children who started school at the age of 5 years participated in the study over a two and a half-year period. Method. Path analyses were used to examine the relationships between readingrelated skills and reading self-concept at the start of Year 1, the middle of Year 2, and the middle of Year 3. Results. Reading performance emerged as causally predominant over reading selfconcept between the middle of Year 2 and the middle of Year 3. Conclusions. Initial reading-related experiences in school are associated with the development of reading self-concepts within the first two and a half years of schooling. This period may mark the time during which negative 'Matthew effects' develop for those who experience initial difficulties in learning to read. Learning to read is the central learning activity undertaken by young children during the early elementary school years, and it is basic to success in school. A significant factor associated with the development of reading skills is the child's evolving self-system. The self-system includes a variety of related factors such as self-concept, self-efficacy, selfworth, attributions, and expectations (Borkowski, Cam, Rellinger & Pressley, 1990). These factors are thought to influence achievement mainly by means of their effect on motivation (e.g., Bandura, 1986; Borkowski el al., 1990; Schunk, 1991) and the self-regulation processes of metacognition (Borkowski, Day, Saenz, Dietmeyer, Estrada & Groteluschen, 1992). In the context of reading, the motivational influence of the self-system is said to determine whether 'opportunities to read would be sought or avoided, the amount of effort that would be expended during reading, and the degree of persistence demonstrated in pursuing text comprehension' (Henk & Melnick, 1992, p. 11 1). Considering the importance of learning to read and the influences of a child's self-system on reading behaviours, it is not surprising that reading-related self-perceptions have been",

We expected that by the middle of the third year of schooling reading performance would make a significant causal contribution to reading self-concept, but that reading self-concept would not make a significant causal contribution to reading performance. Schunk (1991) suggested that achievement-related self-perceptions initially develop in response to the appraisals by children of their performances in terms of perceived ability, task difficulty and effort requirements, amount of help received from others, 'number and pattern of successes and failures, their perceived similarity to models, and persuader credibility ' (pp. 209-209) . During the first few years of reading instruction, such appraisals are likely to be influenced by early reading performances. Thus, we anticipated that for young, beginning readers, the skill development theory of self-concept development would more likely be supported than the self-enhancement theory.",

During the initial years of reading instruction, it seems more likely that developing reading self-concepts begin to form an association with reading behaviours because of feedback associated with performances on early reading tasks, rather than with general verbal ability at school entry.",

These children were initially enrolled in 16 urban schools, located in a range of socio-economic areas. At the end of the study, there were 122 children remaining in the sample. These children were enrolled in the 16 original schools, as well as six additional schools.

The RSCS comprises 30 items, all worded in question format (e.g., 'Are you a good reader?), rather than the usual declarative format (e.g., 'I am a good reader'). This interrogative wording was chosen in order to reduce the linguistic complexity that young children face when they are required to verify declarative statements (Chapman & Tunmer, 1995) . Children responded to each item along a five-point scale, which included 'Yes, always'; 'Yes, usually'; 'Undecided or unsure'; 'No, not usually'; 'No, never'. The 'undecided or unsure' response was represented by an indication that the child understood the item but was unable to select a definite response. The mid-point of the scale was selected for the 'unsure' responses in order to prevent the weighting bias that would result if these responses were recorded as missing, or allocated a value of zero. In other words, 'unsure' responses were given a neutral numeric weighting. The RSCS internal reliability estimates for children at the different age levels included in the present longitudinal study are as follows: 5 years, a d . 8 5 ; 6 years, ad.84; 7 years, a=.85 (Chapman & Tunmer, 1995) .",

The present study clearly reveals that the interaction starts to occur during the second and third year of schooling. Not surprisingly, there was no significant relationship between pre-reading skills and initial reading self-concept soon after children first commenced school, and neither of these variables made a significant contribution to the prediction of each other midway during the second year of schooling. Considered together with the relatively weak path from initial reading self-concept to reading self-concept in the middle of Year 2, these data suggest that young children's emerging reading self-concepts are undergoing change, most likely in response to formal reading instruction and the associated developing patterns of accomplishment in reading and reading-related tasks (Shell et al., 1995; Stipek, 1993) .",

This observation suggests that the emergence of a relationship between a specific facet of achievement-related self-perceptions (reading self-concept) and actual achievement behaviour (reading) occurs sooner than other researchers have observed for more general achievementrelated self-perceptions and performance outcomes (e.g., Nicholls, 1978 Nicholls, , 1979 Stipek, 1993) . Indeed, results from some previous studies have shown that a significant relationship between academic self-perceptions and achievement does not occur until around grade 3 (8 years old) (Nicholls, 1978 (Nicholls, , 1979 . These findings have led to the view that young children are incapable of forming realistic achievement-related self-perceptions mainly because of the pre-school and early elementary school emphasis on intra-individual mastery of developmental skills, social behaviours, and work habits (e.g., Stipek, 1993) . Although an emphasis on these elements of the learning environment is most likely characteristic of junior elementary school classrooms, stressing their importance may obscure the role played in reading self-concept development by the task-related cognitive demands of acquiring reading skills.",

The point at which these self-perceptions begin to exert some causal influence on reading achievement, however, remains to be established. The findings from other studies suggest that academic selfconcept may start to exert some causal influence on achievement between grades 3 and 5. Kurtz-Costes & Schneider (1 994) for example, observed a reciprocal relationship between academic self-concept and achievement over a two-year period for children who were 8 years old when the study commenced. Similarly, Helmke (1992) observed reciprocal interactions between self-concept and achievement during grades 5 and 6. By the time children reach high school age, academic self-concept appears to become causally predominant over achievement (Marsh, 1987 (Marsh, , 1990 Shavelson & Bolus, 1982) . The causal interplay between academic self-perceptions and achievement, then, may follow a developmental trend that ( 1) begins with achievement being predominant over self-concept during the first few grades, (2) moves into a middle school phase during which the relationship is predominantly reciprocal, and (3) proceeds to the high school period when self-concept develops causal predominance over achievement.",

Initial and specific difficulties in reading may result in generalised deficits 'due to the behaviorakognitivehotivational spinoffs from failure at such crucial tasks as reading' (p. 389). Stanovich refers to these negative spinoffs as 'negative Matthew effects' (p. 360); they are reciprocally compounding interactions of emerging negative self-beliefs and diminishing opportunities to acquire and refine the cognitive skills and strategies that are characteristic of proficient learners. Similarly, Spear-Swerling & Sternberg (1994) concluded that 'once children have entered the \"swamp\" of negative expectations, lowered motivation, and limited practice, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to get back on the road of proficient reading' (p. 101).",
