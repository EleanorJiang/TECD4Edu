The internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model by Marsh (1986) assumes intra-individual dimensional comparisons in which students compare their own achievements in one subject with their achievements in other subjects. These comparison processes should lead to negative paths from achievement in one subject (e.g. maths) on self-concept in another subject (e.g. verbal domains). Aims. Within this study, we investigated the impact of students' belief in a negative interdependence of maths and verbal abilities, that is, whether students think of maths and verbal abilities as negatively correlated or not, on the impact of dimensional comparisons. Methods. Maths and German grades, academic self-concepts in maths and German, and a new scale on the beliefs in a negative interdependence of maths and verbal abilities students were assessed (N \u00bc 1; 443). Results. The importance of the negative interdependence beliefs could be shown: stronger beliefs in a negative interdependence of maths and verbal ability are accompanied by more negative path coefficients from grades in one subject to academic self-concepts in the other subject. Conclusions. Dimensional comparisons seem to be of particular importance for students with negative interdependence beliefs.",

According to the internal/ external frame of reference model (Marsh, 1986 (Marsh, , 1990 , they compare their levels of academic ability using two different, but connected, frames of reference. Within the external frame of reference, students make social comparisons, that is, they compare their ability and achievement to the perceived abilities and achievements of their classmates. This external reference serves as a basis for their maths and verbal self-concepts. For example, if their verbal achievement is higher than their classmates' achievement, then their verbal self-concept tends to be higher too. Because achievements in maths and verbal school subjects are typically positively correlated, these social comparisons lead to the expectation that domain-specific maths and verbal self-concepts are positively correlated as well.",

                "text": "Processes of dimensional comparison 1 (M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001a) have been drawn on to explain the domain-specificity of academic self-concepts and the typically only very low correlations between verbal and maths self-concepts. According to the internal frame of reference, students evaluate their achievements in any particular subject in relation to their achievements in other subjects. Aside from the external (social) comparison, the dimensional comparison process is used as the second basis for the formation of a self-concept in each subject. According to this process, lower maths skills lead to a lower maths self-concept based on external comparisons with classmates' achievements in maths, but to a higher verbal self-concept, based on internal comparisons with their own better achievements in verbal domains. The relative weight of both comparison processes explains the moderate or near zero correlation between maths and verbal self-concepts. These patterns were found in a variety of studies on different age groups with different methodologies in several countries (Bong, 1998; Faber, 1992; K\u00f6ller, Klemmert, M\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 1999; Marsh, 1986 Marsh, , 1990 Marsh, Walker, & Debus, 1991; M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001b; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1990 Tay, Licht, & Tate, 1995; Williams & Montgomery, 1995) and for different ability groups (M\u00f6ller, Streblow, & Pohlmann, 2002; Plucker & Stocking, 2001) . Empirical support for the I/E model is usually based on such correlational data. There are also a few important experimental or field-experimental studies on the I/E model (see M\u00f6ller & Husemann, in press; M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001a) .",

More specifically, subjective theories about the nature of intelligence or ability are dealt with in educational psychology. For example, students' assumptions about the mutability of intelligence, that is, whether they have a more incremental or entity theory, determine whether students are more or less oriented on achievement or learning goals (Dweck & Leggett, 1988) . In a similar way, Nicholls (1992) pointed out that goal orientations are based on subjective theories and beliefs about the causes of success. Task-oriented students believe in interest, effort, cooperation with classmates, and deeper learning strategies as sources of scholastic success. Ego-oriented persons, in contrast, believe in competition and social comparisons as the basis of scholastic success.",

They suggest that the negative contrast effects from achievement in one subject on self-concept in the other subject will not occur for all students. According to this assumption, dimensional comparisons could be without consequences if students rate their maths and verbal ability as equally good or bad. Skaalvik and Rankin asked their participants 'if they thought they were better in maths or better in verbal skills or equal in these activities' (p. 271). As proposed, significant negative effects from achievement on the non-corresponding self-concept were only revealed for students who differ in their evaluation of their maths and their verbal ability (in spite of their positive correlations between the two achievements r \u00bc :63). Students who rated their maths and verbal ability equally, showed no negative significant contrast effects from achievement on noncorresponding self-concept.

Students which attest themselves a similar ability in both subjects should only reveal small self-concept differences, positive selfconcept correlations, and almost no contrast effects. However, Skaalvik and Rankin's approach refers to a substantial research requirement in I/E research. As Bong (1998) and Marsh and Yeung (2001) have stated, the conditions of the contrast effects from one subject on self-concept in another subject, and thereby the antecedents of dimensional comparison processes, should be a topic of research. There should be some differences between students in the way they carry out the juxtaposition of both the social and the dimensional comparison process. One important determinant of the way individuals consider the internal frame of reference may be their subjective belief about the interdependence of maths and verbal abilities; that is, how they think about the domainspecificity of ability in general, whether maths and verbal ability are negatively correlated or not. This ability belief perhaps goes beyond the students' estimation whether their own abilities in the two subjects are quite different or not. From this perspective, our study firstly tries to demonstrate that beliefs in a negative interdependence of maths and verbal abilities is more than just a reflection of differentiated self-perceived abilities and secondly tries to evaluate its moderating role in the I/E model. However, recent work on epistemological beliefs (Hofer, 2000) also deals with the domain-specificity of the nature of knowledge. Results in a study by Buehl, Alexander, and Murphy (2002) suggested that students possess certain domain-specific beliefs about knowledge, for example, in mathematics and history. Beliefs about need for effort and beliefs about integration of information and problem-solving were shown to be domain-specific. The belief in a negative interdependency of maths and verbal ability may be seen like an epistemological belief dealing with the relation of abilities in two domains.",

                "text": "It is the main purpose of our study to test the assumption that such a belief in a negative interdependence reinforces the negative effects of achievement in one domain on self-concept in the other domain. For example, some students may think of maths and verbal ability as uncorrelated or even negatively correlated. For them, the information that a person got a good exam grade in maths means that this person tends to have a lower verbal ability. Therefore, good grades in maths lead to higher maths selfconcepts but may reduce verbal self-concepts. This is just the process assumed, as the basis of the contrast effects from achievement in the one subject on self-concept in the other subject in the I/E model. Other students may believe that maths and verbal ability are positively correlated (as they, like many studies in fact show, obviously are). For them, the information that a person got a good exam grade in maths means that this person tends to have an above average verbal ability, too. For these persons with less negative interdependence beliefs, the contrast effects of achievement in the one subject on self-concept in the other subject as postulated in the I/E model should be smaller, or even zero. To illustrate this assumption, imagine a student who takes their good maths achievements as an indicator of a high general intelligence, consequently expecting to be good in verbal subjects as in maths, and therefore develops a high verbal self-concept. Through this process, an internal comparison can lead even to a positive effect when an excellent achievement in one domain tends to raise a students' self-concept in another domain as shown by M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, Streblow, and K\u00f6ller (2004) for the relations between maths and physics.",

In the present study, correlation between maths achievement and self-concept was r \u00bc :58, and correlation between German achievement and self-concept was r \u00bc :48. Because access to students' actual grades was restricted, and for economical reasons, grades were obtained by self-report. Students were asked: 'Which grade were you given in your last report in the following subjects?' Grades in reports had been announced 1-2 months before the investigation began. In our study, students wrote their grade in a box beside the subject name. Grades in German schools range between 1 \u00bc very good and 6 \u00bc poor, but are reverse-coded, so that positive correlations between grade and selfconcept within a domain are expected. Self-reports of grades may be vulnerable to intentional or unintentional under-and over-estimation. Some USA studies have shown that students tend to overestimate their GPA (see Dobbins, Farh, & Werbel, 1993; Flake & Goldman, 1991; Goldman, Flake, & Matheson, 1990; Shepperd, 1993; Trice, 1990; Zimmerman, Caldwell, & Bernat, 2002 ; but see Frucot & Cook, 1994; Kirk & Sereda, 1969) . In the German school system, where grades are given in the form of whole numbers for single subjects (German, mathematics, English, physics, biology, sports, music, etc.), biased self-reports of grades seem to be less likely as M\u00f6ller et al. (2004) showed in a small empirical study (see Helmke, 1992 , for additional support).",

Within Sample 1, 130 (50.0% female) students were asked for their beliefs about the negative interdependency of abilities between German and maths and between German and English. As expected, the negativity of the interdependence was significantly, t\u00f0128\u00de \u00bc 7:66; p , :001, higher for the German-maths combination (M \u00bc 2:57; SD \u00bc 0:61) than for the German-English combination (M \u00bc 2:07; SD \u00bc 0:51). Within Sample 2, 168 (60.9% female) students were asked for their beliefs about the negative interdependency of abilities between maths and German and between maths and chemistry. Again, as expected, the negativity of the interdependence was significantly, t\u00f0167\u00de \u00bc 14:32; p , :001, higher for the maths-German combination (M \u00bc 2:60, SD \u00bc 0:66) than for the maths-chemistry combination (M \u00bc 1:89, SD \u00bc 0:46). Obviously students perceived German and maths ability as more distinct factors than they perceived two scientific subjects or two languages. Therefore, these small pre-studies indicate some face validity to the scale. Table 1 shows the variables' means (SD) and the correlations among all achievement and self-concept variables and ability beliefs for the whole sample and the two subsamples divided on the NAB median. As postulated by the I/E model, the achievement correlation was higher (r \u00bc :34) than the self-concept correlation (r \u00bc 2:08). Ability belief scores were moderately negatively correlated with achievements and selfconcepts. The correlation between the two achievements in German and maths is slightly higher in the group with less specific ability beliefs. As expected, maths and German self-concept correlations differ between the two groups and are -in spite of the still positive achievement correlations -negative for students who believe in a negative interdependence of maths and verbal abilities. Within the domains, correlations between achievement and self-concept are similar for both groups. More important, NAB scores are only moderately correlated with individual absolute differences in grades (r \u00bc :18) and self-concepts (r \u00bc :33).",

A detailed presentation of SEM is beyond the scope of the present investigation, but is available elsewhere (e.g. Hayduck, 1987; J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 1993) . Following Marsh, Balla, and Hau (1996) and Marsh, Balla, and McDonald (1988) , we emphasize the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) to evaluate goodness of fit which, compared with x 2 -statistics, are less sensitive to sample size. According to recommendations by the authors mentioned above, a sufficient model fit is indicated by TLI-values above .90 (some authors recommend .95) and RMSEA-values below .08. Although tests of statistical significance and indices of fit help to evaluate the fit of a model, there is ultimately some degree of subjective and professional judgment in the selection of a 'best' model. As a part of AMOS 4.01 (Arbuckle, 1999) the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) was used to estimate unbiased covariance matrices in the case of missing data (Wothke, 2000) In the first step of our analyses, we were interested in how NAB moderates the effects of grades on maths and German self-concepts. We analyzed a model in which NAB should affect the I/E pattern between grades and the two academic self-concepts. Statistically expressed, we expected significant NAB \u00a3 Grade interactions on the selfconcept variables. In AMOS, moderating effects in SEM are to be examined in two ways (if no latent variables were modelled), both of them used in our analysis. The first way is analogous to regression analysis with interaction effects to directly integrate the product terms into the path analysis as additional predictors, here NAB \u00a3 Grade. To receive meaningful interpretations, the single scores have to be z-standardized before building the product terms (see Cronbach, 1987) . Otherwise there will result strong multicollinearity within the model. Consequently, the z-standardized multiplied grade and NAB scores build the interaction terms to ascertain the impact of NAB on the relations between grades and self-concepts. The other strategy is to dichotomize the moderator variable to establish two groups with high versus low scores. In the next step, the hypothesis is tested if the paths of a specified model are different in both groups.",

Figure 1 presents a path model including the interaction terms 'negative interdependence of math and verbal ability beliefs (NAB) \u00a3 achievement'. The model fit is rather satisfactory (x 2 \u00f079\u00de \u00bc 651:55, TLI \u00bc :98, RMSEA \u00bc :071). The links between grades and self-concepts were as is expected in the I/E model. Math grade affected maths self-concept positively (.65) and German self-concept negatively (2 .30). A similar pattern resulted for the German grade (.58 on German self-concept, 2 .24 on maths self-concept). The NAB term negatively affects the maths and the German selfconcepts. The belief in a negative interdependence of maths and verbal ability seems to lower students' maths and verbal self-concepts. Interaction terms positively influenced the corresponding self-concepts (maths: .13; German .09). The positive effects on the corresponding self-concepts may be interpreted as reinforcing the impact from grades on corresponding self-concepts. For example, students with high scores in the ability belief scale (who believe that maths and verbal abilities are quite distinct) and good grades in maths (German), and therefore high interaction term scores, had higher maths (verbal) self-concepts. More interestingly, the interaction term negatively influenced the divergent self-concepts (maths: 2 .11; German 2 .08). The negative effects on the noncorresponding self-concepts may be interpreted as reinforcing the impact from grades on non-corresponding self-concepts: students with high scores in the ability belief scale and good grades in maths (German), and therefore high interaction term scores had Figure 1 .

However, the main purpose of this study was an extension to the I/E model: to investigate the consequences of different ability beliefs on the links between achievement and self-concept. For this purpose a scale was established to cover students' thoughts about the relations between maths and verbal ability and achievement. The scale was quite reliable and successful in predicting students' ratings in a small pre-study. Students had more negative interdependence beliefs when they had to rate the maths-German combination than when they had to rate the maths-chemistry or the German-English combination. The main assumption was that students who think of maths and verbal subjects as negatively-related domains are more likely to show more negative paths from achievement in one subject on self-concept in the other subject. As expected, the achievement/self-concept links across the subjects were influenced by the negativity of the interdependence beliefs as the interpretation of the interaction term effects demonstrated. The contrast effects from achievement in one subject on self-concept in the other subject increased with stronger beliefs in a negative interdependence of maths and verbal ability. With decreasing negativity of the interdependence beliefs, weaker Figure 2 .

Beliefs in the negative interdependency of maths and verbal abilities seem to strengthen the patterns described in the I/E model. Beside these differences, there are some similarities between the coefficients for the low and high NAB groups. Therefore, the I/E model fits to the data in both groups. Only the achievement correlations and the negative paths from achievements to non-corresponding self-concepts seem to differ substantially between the groups.

We wanted to study students' assumptions according to the relation between maths and verbal achievement and ability, whereas Skaalvik and Rankin asked their students for their intra-individual differences between their maths and verbal self-concepts. Each strategy seems to lead to different results. Skaalvik and Rankin revealed that there were no inverse effects from achievement in one domain on self-concept in the other domain if students think that they themselves are equally achieving in both domains. Our study shows that the belief in a negative interdependency of maths and verbal abilities strengthens the negative paths, whereas they are diminished for students with less negative interdependent ability beliefs. This process seems to be relatively independent from students' own achievement differences as the weak correlation between NAB scores and the grade differences showed. More importantly, the NAB scale is only moderately correlated with absolute differences between self-concepts, therefore it measures ability beliefs relatively independently from self-concept differences.",

Additionally, subject-specific selfconcepts were demonstrated to influence students' course selection (K\u00f6ller, Daniels, Schnabel, & Baumert, 2000; Marsh & Yeung, 1997) . Consequently, students who believe in a negative interdependency between maths and verbal ability may unfortunately tend to avoid special subjects when they think that they achieve better in other domains (Hannover & Kessels, 2004) . When such perceptions are only due to small achievement differences, this may lead to premature specialization. Such misinterpretations may be prevented when students develop less negatively interdependent ability beliefs. From this point of view it could be fruitful for good students to develop less negative interdependent ability beliefs to prevent premature differentiation of subject-specific self-concepts and, therefore, one-sided course selections. On the other hand, weaker students may profit from the belief that maths and verbal ability are negatively correlated. When a weaker student achieves poorly in one subject (e.g. maths), such beliefs hinder them to generalize their perception of lack of ability to verbal domains and perhaps prevent from motivational shortcomings in the verbal domain.",
