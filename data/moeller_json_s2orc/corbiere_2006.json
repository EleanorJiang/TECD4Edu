                "text": "Factors contributing to academic achievement have been studied extensively for many years, with certain concepts emerging as more influent than others such as academic selfconcept and academic interest. In this introduction, a definition of both concepts is provided and the links between academic self-concept, academic interest and academic achievement are also presented. academic self-concept, the skill development theory (Skaalvik & Hagvet, 1990 ), (2) academic self-concept predicts academic achievement, the self-enhancement theory (Shavelson & Bolus, 1982) and, (3) the two concepts affect each other reciprocally, the reciprocal model (Liu & Kaplan, 1992; Marsh & Yeung, 1997) . Results stemming from longitudinally designed studies have primarily supported the reciprocal model, with authors further emphasizing the need to intervene on improving students' academic self-concept in order to help them meet their academic goals (Guay, Marsh, & Boivin, 2003; Marsh & Yeung, 1997) . With respect to academic interest, a meta-analysis conducted by Schiefele and Csikszentmihalyi (1994) has illustrated the significant relationship between academic interest and academic achievement. Based on results from 16 empirically sound studies, Schiefele and Csikszentmihalyi (1994) detected a significant mean correlation coefficient value (r=.31) between the two targeted concepts. The results also suggested that academic interest and academic achievement were linked for all academic subjects (i.e., Mathematics, Science, Physics, Social Science, Literature, etc.) . Furthermore, another study indicates a reciprocal relationship between academic interest and academic achievement (Corbi\u00e8re, 1998) .",

Since most validated instruments in education stem from Australia and North America, the investigation of these concepts using validated instruments in Western Europe (e.g., France and Italy) is necessary in order to better understand academic achievement across educational systems. Furthermore, Cokley, Komarraju, King, Cunningham, and Muhammad (2003) mention that it is possible to observe ethnic differences in the measurement of academic selfconcept. In their study, the factor structure of the academic self-concept was different in African Americans when compared to European Americans. The analysis of instruments across languages is also important in order to verify the structural invariance of the questionnaires in different linguistic versions.",

Second, Confirmatory Factor Analyses with French and Italian samples enabled verification of the factorial structure of each questionnaire according to the following models: (a) distinct academic concepts without intercorrelations, (b) intercorrelation between the two academic concepts, and (c) one single dimension accounting for both academic concepts. Third, by considering the results from the previous CFA, Multi-Sample Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MCFA) was performed to test the invariance across the two samples. Fourth, correlations between all questionnaires from both samples, Italian and French, were examined.

MCFA not only offers several tests from unconstrained to very constrained, but it also offers statistical fit-indices, which provide objective methods for deciding on the presence or absence of differences between groups. In other words, MCFA permits testing of different equivalence levels between samples (in this case, French and Italian samples). Within MCFA, a hierarchical procedure is available in order to establish the equivalence between groups. First, the most critical aspect of factor invariance evaluated across groups is related to factor loadings, particularly, whether the loadings are equal between the groups. Second, another important equivalence is the factors' correlation, because it suggests that the factors or components are interrelated in the same way across groups. Third, the invariance of item error variances is optional because it is possible to observe variations among respondents from different countries. This entire hierarchical procedure was followed in this study.",

The internal consistency coefficients for the academic interest and academic self-concept (Math and Italian/French) questionnaires were all satisfactory with alphas from .73 to .89 (Table 1) . Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out on both French and Italian samples, using the following questionnaires: Academic interest and Academic self-concept in Math (12 items), and Academic interest and Academic self-concept in French or Italian (12 items) by testing the three abovementioned models ( Table 2) . Regardless of the specific subject area, the \"Intercorrelation between the two concepts\" model fitted the empirical data and was more satisfactory than the other two models (i.e., the 'distinct concepts without intercorrelations', and the 'one single dimension accounting for both concepts' model). The adjustment indices such as Chi square/df (French sample range: 2.09 to 2.18, Italian sample range: 6.09 to 7.35), the NFI, NNFI, CFI, CFI robust, IFI (range: .91 to .95, both samples) as well as the RMSEA (from .06 to .08) were all satisfactory (Table 2) . Moreover, with only one degree of freedom less (from to 54 to 53), the Chi square value from the \"Intercorrelation between the two concepts\" model was notably lower irrespective of the specific subject area (e.g., French sample Math range: 208.98 to 110.90, Italian sample Math range: 1095.58 to 389.65, Table 2 ). Multi-Sample Confirmatory Factor Analyses (MCFA) were also carried out on the questionnaires using French and Italian samples, by testing the \"Intercorrelation between the two concepts\" model for each subject area, Math and First Language (French/Italian) separately. The results were very satisfactory using the hierarchical procedure for invariance across groups (i.e., factor loadings invariance, factor correlation invariance, and the invariance of item error variances, using equality constraints across groups). Even though the invariance of item error variances was trivial, MCFAs yielded a satisfactory model adjustment suggesting an invariance across French and Italian samples. In this last case, MCFA results presented satisfactory adjustment coefficients ranging from .90 to .92 for the NFI, NNFI, CFI, CFI and IFI indexes (Mueller, 1996; Joresk\u00f6g & S\u00f6rbom, 1993) . The respective values for RMSEA (varying from .06 to .07) and Chi square/df (varying from 5.10 to 6.70) were also satisfactory (Byrne, 1989; Hofmann, 1995) . However, with respect to the Math subject, the Chi square/dl value was borderline. Regarding the correlations (Table 4) between the academic self-concept and the academic interest from both samples, the results showed significant coefficients (p<.01) for both subject areas, Math (French sample: .49 and Italian Sample: .70) and First Language (French: .51 and Italian: .64). Regardless of the academic concept, the coefficients of correlation between Math and First Language (French/Italian) were low or non-significant (from .01 to -.19). With respect to academic achievement (French sample), the coefficients of correlation were higher with the academic self-concept (Math: .62 and French: .66) compared to the academic interest (Math: .27 and French: .36).

Each conceptual dimension was composed of six items and presented satisfactory internal consistency with alpha coefficients ranging from .73 to .89 for both samples. Confirmatory Factor Analyses also enabled us to confirm which theoretical model best fit the data, by describing a correlation between the two concepts varying from .49 to .70. Even though the results revealed fairly high correlation coefficients between the two concepts when using Math and First Language as academic subjects, the academic self-concept and academic interest questionnaires still portrayed distinct characteristics. These results support the theoretical perspective which stipulates that academic self-concept consists of perceptions that arise through one's experience and are reinforced by significant others. Academic interest is more of a directive force, linked to the valence attached to a specific subject area, and is also the result of present and past experiences. In brief, despite certain similitudes between the two academic concepts, each of them holds distinct characteristics and should therefore be considered separately.",

Furthermore, whatever the academic concept (academic self-concept or academic interest), it is important to consider the academic subject in order to observe a significant correlation with the grade. On the one hand, these results suggest that academic interest seems less significant than academic self-concept to explain academic achievement in a specific subject area. The former is related to the driving force whereas the latter is associated with self-competence. On the other hand, these results support those from Marsh's study (1992) , where the specific academic subject needs to be taken into consideration in order to establish a significant correlation between academic concepts (academic self-concept and academic interest) and academic achievement.",
