    "abstract": "Data for this study were obtained from the second follow-up of the sophomore cohort of the High School and Beyond Study, with 14,825 students from 1,015 schools involved. Mathematics and English self-concepts were found to be, (1) uncorrelated desoite a substantial correlation between mathematics and English test scores; (2) influenced by internal and external frames of reference; and (3) negatively affected by school-average achievement. The internal/external frame of reference model posits that a student's self-concept in a particular academic subject area is formed in relation to performances by other students in the same subject (external) and in relation to the performance by the same student in other academic subjects (internal). As predicted by the model, better mathematics skills were associated with substantially higher mathematics self-concepts, but slightly lower English self-concepts, whereas better English skills were associated with substantially higher English self-concepts, but slightly lower mathematics self-concepts. School-average achievement was one determinant of the external reference in that equally able students had higher academic self-concepts in schools with lower school-average achievement. Further, this school context effect was also content-specific. School-average mathematics achievement negatively affected only mathematics self-concept, and school-average English achievement negatively affected only English self-concept. (Author/MNS",

Academic self-concept measures may lack validity for the purpose of predicting academic achievement, but this is not their intended purpose. It also follows that academic achievement measures lack validity for the purpose of predicting academic self-concept. When there are systematic differences between academic achievement indicators'and academic self-concepts, it is important to determine why these differences exist in order to better understand the formation of self-concept. One such explanation is that self-perceptions must be evaluated in relation to frames of reference and these frames of reference may differ from those used to evaluate objective indicators of achievement or those used by external observers. Social psychological and psychophysical research provides ample evidence that changes in the frame of reference can substantially alter psychological judgments. In a school setting the context established by the achievement levels of other students in the same school provides a particularly salient frame of reference.",

                "text": "Historically, self-concept research has emphasized a general, overall or total self-concept. More recently, self-concept theory (s.g., Byrne, 1984; Marsh, Byrne & Shavelson, in press; Shavelson, Hubner & Stanton, 1976 ) has emphasized the multidimensionality of self-concept, and empirical studies have identified distinct, a priori facets of self-concept (e.g., Boersma & Chapman, 1979; Byrne & Shavelson, 1986; Dusek & Flaherty, 1981; Fleming & Courtney, 1984; Harter, 1982; Marsh, 1986; Marsh, Smith, Barnes & Butler, 1983; Marsh, Barnes, Cairns & Tidman, 1984; Marsh, Barnes & Hocevar, 1985; Soares & Soares, 1982) . In a review of this research, Marsh and Shavelson (1985) concluded that the relations between self-concept and other constructs cannot be adequately understood if this multidimensionality is ignored. Support for this conclusion was particularly strong for academic self-concept and its relation to academic achievement (Byrne, 1984; Byrne & Shave/son, 1786) . Shavelson, Hubner and Stanton (1976) posited self-concept to be a multifaceted, hierarchical construct. They presented a possible representation of this hierarchy in which general self-concept appeared at the apex and was divided into academic and nonacademic self-concepts, According to this model self-concepts in particular academic areas (e.g., math, English, etc.) combine to form a higher-order academic self-concept. Shavelson et al. based their model, in part, on conceptually similar models of ability that posit a higher-order ability factor as well as more specific components of ability (e.g., Vernon, 1950) . Also, mathematics and English achievements are highly correlated and so it is reasonable to except that the corresponding self-concepts should also be highly correlated. Based on such reasoning, Shavelson et al. posited that the different academic self-concepts would be substantially correlated and could be incorporated into a single facet of academic self-concept.",

Of particular relevance to the present investigation, English and math self-concepts were found to be nearly uncorrelated and did not combine to form a single, second-order academic factor. The lack of correlation between math and verbal selfconcepts generalizes across preadolescent to young adult ages (Marsh, 1986) and across responses to three differ-int academic self-concept instruments (Marsh, Byrne & Shavelson, in ores:) .

Marsh (1986) proposed the internal/external frame of reference model to describe why English ano math self-concepts are so distinct from each other and so content specific in their relations to English and math achievements. According to the internal/external model, math and English self-concepts are formed in relation to both external and internal comparisons, or frames of reference. Using an external reference, students compare self-perceptions of their own math and English skills with the perceived skills of other students. This external, relativistic impression serves as one basis for their math and English self-concepts. The model further posits an internal comparison process for which each student compares his or her self-perceived math skills with his or her own selfperceived English skills. This internal, relativistic impression serves as a second basis for math and English self-concepts. To clarify how these frames of reference work, consider students who accurately perceive their math and English skills to be below average, but whose math skills are better than their English skills. These students have math skills that are below average relative to other students (an external comparison) but that are above average relative to their English skills (an internal comparison). Depending on how these two components are weighted, these students may have average or even above-average math self-concepts despite their poor math skills. According to this model, poor students will have what appears to be unrealistically high self -coacepts in their best academic subjects whereas good students will have what appears to be unrealistically low self-concepts in their poorest academic subjects.",

English and math achievements are substantially correlated. Hence, this external cemparison process should lead to a positive correlation between English self-concept and math self-concept as originally anticipated in the Shavelson model. The internal comparison process, though more unusual in other theoretical accounts, is like the compensatory model described by Byrne (1984) and by Winne and Marx (1981) . Since self-perceptions of math achievement and of English achievement are compared with each other, it is the difference between the two that contributes to a high self-concept in one area or the other. Hence, the internal process should lead to a negative correlation between English self-concept and math self-concept. The joint operation of both processes, depending on the relative strength of each, will lead to the near-zero correlations that have been observed in empirical research.",

According to the model, perceiving oneself to have good mathematics skills detracts from English self-concept at all levels of math and English achievements, and perceiving oneself to have good English skills detracts from math self -concept at all levels of math and English achievements. Tests of the internal/external model (Marsh, 1986) have used path analyses in which English and math achievements are regressed on English and math self -concepts.'In this model, academic achievement is hypothesized to be one causal determinant of academic self-concept, but does not argue against the a more dynamic model where subsequent levels of academic achievement and self-concept are each determined by prior levels of achievement and self-concept. The I/E model predicts that: (a) English and math self-concepts will be nearly uncorrelated or at least substantially less correlated than English ano math achievements, (b) English achievement will have a strong, positive effect on English selfconcept but a weaker, negative effect on math self-concept, and (0 math achievement will have a strong positive effect on math self-concept but a weaker, negative effect on English self-concept.",

                "text": "Students, due to de facto or systematic selection processes, often find themselves in a school setting where the average ability of their classmates differs substantially from the average ability levels in other schools. Logic and theory suggest alternative, competing effects that this situation may have on academic self-concept (e.g., Felson, 1981; Felson & Reed, 1986; Festinger, 1954; Kelley, 1952; Epoethals, 1986) . For example, being an average-ability student in a high-ability group of classmates may affect academic self-concept such that it is, (a) below average because the basis of comparison is the performance of above-average students (i.e., a BFLPE or contrast effect); (b) above average by virtue of membership in the high-ability grouping (i.e., a reflected glory, group identification, or assimilation effect)); or (c) average because it is unaffected by the immediate context of the other students, or because \"a\" and \"b\" occur simultaneously and cancel each other. The net effect of school-average ability on academic self-concept represents the combined influence of these competing effects (see Felson & Reed, 1986 ). Marsh (1987; Marsh & Parker, 1984) found that equally able students have lower academic self-concepts when they attend schools where the school-average ability level is higher. He labelled this effect as the PAYE and posited a frame-of-reference model to explain it. In this respect, the BFLPE is a special case of the external comparison process posited in the internal/external model described earlier. The BFLPE is also one specific example of more gewral frame of reference effects that have been studied widely by social psychologists (e.g., Sherif & Sherif, 1969; Upshaw, 1969) and psychometricians (e.g., Nelson, 1964) . Consistent with this previous research, the standard of comparison was operationalized as the average ability level of stddents in the school (hereafter called school-average ability). The theoretical model used to explain the BFLPE (Marsh, 1984b) posits that students will use this standard of comparison in forming self-concepts. Thus, equally able students will have lower selfperceived academic skills and lower academic self-concepts in high-ability schools than in low-ability schools because students in high-ability schools compare themselves with more able students than do students in lowability schools.",

                "text": "Study of the BFLPE is important in determining how self-concept is formed, but it also has important practical implications. Marsh (1987; Marsh and Parker, 1984) described the practical implications for parents who consider the possibility of placing their children in selective, highability schools, because this will apparently produce a lower academic self-concept. At least for some children, the early formation of a selfimage of themselves as a poor student may be more detrimental than the possible benefits of attending a high-ability school. Davis (1966) described an effect similar to the BFLPE in a study of the career aspirations of college men. He concluded: The aphorism 'It is better to be a big frog in a small pond than a small frog in a big pond' is not perfect advice, but it is not trivial\" (p. 31) and warned that \"counselors and parents might well consider the drawbacks as well as the advantages of sending their boy to a 'fine' college, if, when doing so, it is fairly certain that he will end up in the bottom ranks of his graduating class\" (p. 31) Emairical sumort for the BFLPEt The existence of the BFLPE has been supported by research using a wide variety of different experimental and analytical approaches. Using path analysis, Marsh and Parker (1984) found that when individual ability level was controlled, school-average ability affected academic self-concept negatively; equally able students had lower academic self-concepts when they attended high-ability schools. Marsh (1987) and Bachman and O'Malley (1986) found similar effects in path analytic studies of high school students using the large, nationally representative Youth in Transition data. Bachman and O'Malley (1986) , however, excluded all black students and all predominantly black schools, thereby reducing the variability of school-average ability. For this truncated sample, they reported a smaller BFLPE than did Marsh (1987) for his analysis of the entire sample. Marsh (1987) demonstrated that the theoretical model used to explain the BFLPE predicts that the size of the BFLPE will be directly related to the variability of the school-average means. Thus, the model is consistent P :h both the Bachman and O'Malley (1986) and Marsh (1987) results. Schwarzer, Jerusalem, and Lange (1983) examined the self-concepts of West German students who moved from nonselective, heterogeneous primary schools to secondary schools that were streamed on the basis of academic achievement. At the transition point students who were selected to enter subsequently the high-ability schools had substantially higher academic self-concepts than those entering the low-ability schools, but the two groups did not differ in academic self-concept by the end of their first year in the new schools. Path analyses indicated that the direct influence of school type on academic self-concept was negative. Faison and Reed (1986) posited that the frame-of-reference is better inferred from the average ability levels of other students in the same track and school instead of just the same school. Using a path-analytic model similar to that posited by Marsh and Parker (1984) , they found that track-average test scares negatively influenced self-appraisals of academic ability. Consistent with earlier proposals that the EFLPE may represent the net effect of counter-balancing influences, they further suggested that \"some students in college preparatory tracks may attribute more ability to themselves because of their membership in this group and that this may offset some of the negative effects of social comparison\" (1986, p. 108 ). Strang, Smith and Rogers (1978) tested the self-concepts of academically disadvantaged children who attended some classes with other disadvantaged children and other classes with nondisadvantaged children.",

In each of studies There is ample evidence that multiple frames of reference can exist simultaneously. The study by Strang, Smith and Rogers (1978) , for example, implied that academically disadvantaged children who attended some classes with other disadvantaged children and other classes with nondisadvantaged children had multiple frames of reference. In another example from psychophysical research, Watson (1957) asked subjects to judge the size of circles that also differed in color such that circles of one color (e.g., yellow) were systematically larger than those of a second color (e.g., green). After a preliminary series of 100 trials in which subjects compared yellow circles to other yellow circles and green circles to other green circles, they were then asked to compare yellow and green circles that were identical in size. The color yellow had been associated with larger circles and the yellow stimulus was judged to be systematically smaiAer than the green circle of the same size. These findings are consistent with the contrast effect found in BFLPE studies in that the yellow circle appeared to be smaller in relation to the other yellow circles that were larger even though the yellow circle was the same size as the green circle to which it was compared. Translating this finding into the BFLPE, consider a school in which the school-average ability in mathematics was above-average whereas the school-average ability in English was below-average. *students per school included in the follow-up study. These school-average tests scores were merged with the second follow-up data so that all students from the same school were assigned the same school-average values.",

Unlike classical measurement approaches, the error/ uniquenesses are not required to be independent. This advantage is important for studies such as the present one in which the assumption of uncorrelated error/uniquenesses is problematic. In particular, because the same achievement tests were used to infer individual and school-average achievement scores, the uniquenesses representing the individual and school-average scores on the same test are likely to be correlated. Also, because the wording of the four math selfconcept items is parallel to the wording o4 the four English self-concept items (see Table 1 ), the uniquenesses associated with each pair of items having the same wording are likely to be correlated. Whereas these a priori hypotheses about the measurement model are plausible, the comparison of alternative models provides empirical tests of these assumptions. More importantly, if these assumptions are supported, then conventional approaches to testing the path models would be inappropriate and the implications of these violations would be difficult to evaluate. The structural model contains estimates of causal relations between the latent constructs (i.e., path coefficients) that are corrected for measurement error. In the p. esent investigation 18 measured variables (defined in Table   1 and represented by squares in Figure 1 ) were used to define 6 constructs (represented by circles in Figure 1 ).",

They also, however, noted important practical limitations in these approaches and so evaluated the robustness of the traditional methods used here in a simulation study. They found that it was not the dichotomous nature of variables that produced problems with the traditional approach, but rather the skew and kurtosis of the measured variables. Fortunately, they also found that maximum likelihood estimators and associated chi-square statistics were quite robust when skews and kurtoses were moderate as is the present investigation.",

The results presented here, however, suggest that general academic measures of self -concept should be replaced with math and English measures of selfconcept. Because math and English self-concepts seem to be nearly uncorrelated, it may be unjustified to subsume these two measures into a more general measure of academic self-concept. If the role of selfconcept research in academic settings is to better predict academic behaviors and accomplishments, to provide outcome measures for academic interventions, and to relate academic self-concept to other constructs, then math and English self-concepts may be more useful than a general academic selfconcept. From this perspective it is recommended that future research The internal/external model was developed to explain the dramatic lack of correlation between math and English self-concepts and their corresponding relations to math and English achievement. The present findings because of -;the size and the representativeness of the sample, and because of the sophistication of the covariance structure models, provide important support for the generality of earlier findings. The findings are also important in that they demonstrate that math and English self-concepts are influenced by different processes than those that influence achievement. In this respect, there is empiri:l and theoretical support for earlier suggestions that academic self-concepts and differ from corresponding academic achievements because the two constructs are evaluated in relation to different frames of reference.",

This use of global achievement, school-average global achievement, and global academic self -concept is consistent with the historical tendency to consider academic self-concept as a relatively unidimensional construct. More recent research, however, such as that leading to the development of the internal/external model considered earlier, indicates that math and English self-concepts are relatively uncorrelated and cannot be adequately represented as a single dimension of academic self-concept. An extension of the internal/external model suggests the possibility that school-average measures of mathematics and English differentially affect math and English self-concepts.",

Also, predictions 1-3 based on the original internal/external model that were supported in earlier analyses continue to be supported after the inclusion of school-average variables.The important new predictions for Model 2.4 concern the relations between the school-average math and English Achievements and the corresponding self-concept measures. Consistent with prediction 4, school-average mathematics test scores negatively affects math self-concepts but not English self-concepts. Consistent with prediction 5, school-average English test scores negatively affect English self-concepts but not math self-concepts. These findings provide clear support for the content specificity of the BFLPE to math and English constructs.Several other features cf Model 2.4 deserve further mention. First, not only are all the predictions based on the original internal/external model and its extension satisfied, but there is a striking symmetry in the size of the substantively important parameter estimates for the math and English constructs(Figure 18). This symmetry supports the generality of the hypothesized processes. Second, though not specifically predicted a priori, school-average mathematics has a weak positive effect on English self-concept (e.g., if I am in a school in which other students are mathematical geniuses, my academic self-concept will suffer but my English self-concept may be a bit higher) and school-average English has a weak positive effect on math self-concept. These effects are consistent with the general observation that a variable which effects either one of the academic self-concepts has the opposite effect on the other academic selfconcept. This pattern of counter-balancing effects apparently reflects the internal comparison process described as part of the internal/external model.",

For example, a single global academic achievement construct was associated with all five academic test scores and posited to affect schoolaverage global achievement and global academic self-concept. Even after including all the correlated uniquenesses considered previously, the fit of this model was very poor. Furthermore, the global academic self-concept variable tended to be a bipolar construct in which the math and English items loaded in the opposite direction. The inclusion of additional correlated uniquenesses among the math indicators of each construct and among the English indicators of each construct substantially improved the fit, but resulted in a seriously ill-defined model. In particular, the residual variance estimate for the global academic self-concept construct was significantly less than zero and the global academic self-concept construct was nearly unrelated to the other two constructs. This pattern of results suggests that when variances attributable to the math self-concept indicators and attributable to the English self-concept indicators are partialled out of the global academic self-concept construct through the inclusion of correlated uniquenesses there is little or no variance left in the construct. This observation is consistent with the zero correlation between math and English self-concepts observed in earlier analyses.",

An important purpose of the present investigation is to determine whether or not separate BFLPEs can be established in English and mathematics.The general purpose of the present investigation is to determine how different frames of reference affect the formation of math and English self-concepts. More specifically, the study brings together research on the I/E model and the BFLPE into a single theoretical and empirical framework.Predictions based ol% the interface of I/E model and the BFLPE are tested that have not been previously considered. The HSB data base used to test these predictions is uniquely appropriate because of its size (14,825 students from 1015 high schools) and national representativeness, and because of the quality of particularly the academic achievement measures.To these predictions from the internal/external model that have been supported in previous research are added two previously untested predictions. These are based on the assumption that separate school contexts exist for mathematics and English skills, and the extension of the English self-concept but not on math self-concept.MethodsSagglg and, DataSubject, are the 14,825 respondents selected for the second follow-up of the sophomore cohort of the HSB sturdy. A detailed descrip'ion of these data is available in the data file user's manual produced by the National Center for Educational Statistics(NCES, 1986). The sophomore cohort initially involved a two-stage probability sample of 1,015 high schools and approximately 36 sophomores within each of these high schools. The second follow-up consisted of a probability sample of 14,825 of the original sample. Included on the commercially available data file for the second Wherws analyses were conducted for only responses by the 14,825 students included in the second follow-up, school-average values for the fi :achievement tests (see Tabl' 1) were based on responses by the approximately 30,000 students who completed the tests during their sophomore year in high school.
