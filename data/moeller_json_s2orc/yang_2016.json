    "abstract": "Based on a sample of Year 1 vocational students (N = 962) in China, the study presented in this chapter aimed to (1) test the generalizability of the classic internal/external (I/E) frame of reference model of academic self-concept (Marsh, 1986) to vocational students and (2) extend the classic I/E model by incorporating recent developments of the twofold multidimensional structure of academic selfconcept (i.e., its domain-specifi c structure and a further separation between competence-affect components within each domain). Structural equation modeling analyses for testing the I/E model show that paths from math and Chinese achievements to corresponding domains of self-concept were positive and signifi cant, whereas cross-paths to nonmatching self-concept domains were negatively significant. A further analysis by separating competence and affect components within math and Chinese self-concepts reveals that paths from math and Chinese achievements to matching affect components were stronger than those to competence components. This interesting fi nding is discussed in light of the Chinese cultural model of learning. Implications of our fi ndings for the I/E model, self-concept research, and practice are also discussed.",

Historically, academic self-concept, defi ned as students' self-perceptions in school domains, was conceptualized as a unidimensional higher-order construct that encompasses self-concepts related to math and verbal domains (Marsh, 1986 ; Shavelson et al., 1976 ) . Contrary to this assumption, math and verbal self-concepts were found to be very weakly correlated or to even bear no correlation at all, although math and verbal achievements were found to be substantially correlated (Marsh & Craven, 1997 ; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985 ) . This indicates that academic self-concept is a domain-specifi c construct consisting of separate math and verbal self-concept facets. This property of academic self-concept led to the development of the internal/external (I/E) frames of reference model (Marsh, 1986 ; Marsh & Hau, 2004 ; M\u00f6ller, Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2011 ) . The I/E model offers a theoretical explanation for the strong distinction between math and verbal self-concepts and also explicates the relations between math and verbal self-concept and achievement measures.",

For example, the higher the math achievement one student has in relation to other students, the more likely the student will perceive him/herself to be good at math, leading to a high math academic self-concept. In an additional internal (dimensional) comparison process (Marsh, 1986 ; , students compare their own performances in one school subject with their performances in other school subjects. For instance, an individual student contrasts his/her accomplishments in math with his/her verbal accomplishments. While the external comparison process leads to positive correlations between self-concepts and achievements in matching domains (e.g., math self-concept and math achievement), the internal comparison process results into negative correlations between self-concept and achievement in nonmatching domains of academic self-concept (e.g., math self-concept and verbal achievement). The effects of the two comparison processes balance each other resulting in the low or even negative correlation between math and verbal self-concepts indicating the often-found separation between math and verbal self-concepts (see Fig. 7 .1 ).",

                "text": "Up to date, there is substantial empirical support for the I/E model in both crosssectional and longitudinal settings (K\u00f6ller, Klemmert, M\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 1999 ; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988 ; Marsh & Koller, 2004 ; Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2001 ; Marsh et al., 2014 ; Marsh, Xu, & Martin, 2012 ; Marsh & Yeung, 1998 ; M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001 ; M\u00f6ller et al., 2011 ) . The I/E model has been found to be generalizable across students' ability levels (M\u00f6ller, Streblow, & Pohlmann, 2009 ; Mui, Yeung, Low, & Jin, 2000 ; Plucker & Stocking, 2001 ), gender (Marsh & Yeung, 1998 ) , age (Marsh, 1986 ; Tay, Licht, & Tate, 1995 ) , self-concept, and achievement measures (Marsh et al., 2001 ; Xu et al., 2013 ) and has also been confi rmed in experimental designs (M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001 ; . Substantive support for the I/E model further comes from an extensive meta-analysis (M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2009 ) based on 69 data sets ( n = 125,308). Controlling for the effect of verbal achievement to verbal self-concept (.49) and math achievement to math self-concept (.61), verbal achievement negatively predicted math selfconcept (\u2212.27), and math achievement negatively predicted verbal self-concept (\u2212.21). This pattern found in M\u00f6ller et al.'s ( 2009 ) meta-analytic study is consistent with the predictions of the I/E model (Marsh, 1986 ) . Marsh and Hau ( 2004 ) provided evidence of the cross-cultural validity of the I/E model for math and reading self-concepts and achievements across 26 cultural diverse countries based on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study. More recently, Xu et al. ( 2013 ) expanded the I/E model by evaluating it in relation to two verbal domains (Chinese and English) for native Chinese speakers in Hong Kong schools where the language of instruction was either English or Chinese. The results demonstrated the expected patterns of relations between The classic I/E model predictions based on math and verbal domains (Based on Marsh, 1986 ) . Note : The horizontal lines represent substantially positive effects from achievements to matching domains of self-concepts (++). The cross-paths represent statistically less substantial and negative effects from achievements to nonmatching domains of self-concepts (\u2212). C Chinese, M math, ACH achievement, SC self-concept self-concept and achievement based on previous I/E research (Marsh & Hau, 2004 ; when integrating both Chinese (students' native language) and English (students' nonnative language) as verbal domains. Specifi cally, the paths from math achievement to math self-concept (.61) and from Chinese achievement to Chinese self-concept (.33) were substantially positive, whereas the cross-paths from the achievements of math and Chinese to nonmatching domains of academic self-concept were statistically negative (\u2212.34 for Chinese-math; \u2212.22 for math-Chinese). This pattern was similar in the I/E model for math and English (.58 to .59 for horizontal paths and \u2212.27 to \u2212.30 for cross-paths).",

                "text": "In addition to well-established and widely documented domain specifi city of academic self-concept (Marsh, 1986 ; Marsh & Hau, 2004 ; Seaton, Marsh, Yeung, & Craven, 2011 ; Xu et al., 2013 ) , recent advances in self-concept research extended the structure of academic self-concept to a further distinction between competence and affect components within each domain of academic self-concept. Originally, academic self-concept was supposed to comprise both evaluative and descriptive components (Marsh, 1990b ; Shavelson et al., 1976 ) . This assumption was integrated in the construction of the Self-Description Questionnaire I (SDQ I), a wellvalidated instrument to assess multiple self-concept facets with preadolescent children (Byrne, 1996 ; Marsh, 1990b Marsh, , 2007 . To measure self-concept in academic domains (math, verbal, general school), the SDQ I integrates competence-related items addressing students' self-perceptions of competence (which are more evaluative) and affect-related items addressing students' motivational and affective responses (which are more descriptive). Both sets of items were originally pooled together to create the domain-specifi c academic self-concept scales. However, an increasing body of studies using confi rmatory factor analyses (CFA) with the SDQ I showed that separate constructs were defi ned by the competencerelated and affect-related items of the SDQ I math and verbal scales in a sample of Australian elementary and secondary students (Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 1999 ) and in a sample of French-Canadian students (Marsh & Ayotte, 2003 ) . It should be noted that these studies (Marsh & Ayotte, 2003 ; Marsh et al., 1999 ) only relied on the within-network approach (Byrne, 1984 ) as they examined the internal structure of academic self-concept using confi rmatory factor analyses. Sophisticated selfconcept validation, however, should rely on both the within-network and the between-network approaches (Byrne, 1984 (Byrne, , 1996 . Arens, Yeung, Craven, and Hasselhorn ( 2011 ) enriched previous research on the competence-affect separation of academic self-concept by taking both the within-network approach and the between-network approaches into account. Based on CFA models with a sample of Grades 3 to 6 German students, Arens et al. ( 2011 ) provided further within-network evidence as competence-related and affect-related items were shown to form distinct factors within math and verbal domains. In between-network analyses, the relation between the competence component of academic self-concept and academic achievement was found to be stronger than the relation between the affect component of academic self-concept and academic achievement. Interestingly, this was the case within and across domains as the competence component of math self-concept was more highly related to math achievement, but also to verbal achievement than the affect component of math self-concept. In parallel, the competence component of verbal self-concept displayed higher relations to verbal achievement but also to math achievement than the affect component. Extending these fi ndings to a sample of Grade 8 Saudi students, Abu-Hilal, Abdelfattah, Alshumrani, Abduljabbar, and found that the internal structure of math and science self-concepts was clearer when competence and affective components within the two domains were separated. In addition, math and science competence self-perceptions were found to share higher relations with math and science achievements compared to the affect self-perceptions of the two selfconcept domains, further suggesting the necessity for separating competence and affect components when examining the relations between academic self-concept and external outcomes such as achievement.",

Compared to math competence, math affect was found to have a larger impact on subsequent effort expenditure. Based on these fi ndings, academic self-concept is assumed to comprise a twofold multidimensional structure meaning that it is multidimensional (1) in terms of its domain specifi city (the distinction between math and verbal self-concepts) and (2) in terms of the differentiation between competence and affect constructs within each domain (e.g., math competence, math affect).

                "text": "Based on systematic qualitative approaches to study Chinese students' conceptualization of learning and how Chinese students would describe how an ideal student learns, Li ( 2001 Li ( , 2002 found that fi ve virtues are perceived to be essential in Chinese students' learning processes: (1) the notion of resolve, (2) diligence, (3) endurance of hardship, (4) perseverance, and (5) concentration. Importantly, Chinese learners \"believe that once they have developed the learning virtues, they can apply them to all learning activities and processes\" (Li, 2009 , p. 61) . Li ( 2002 ) conceptualized these learning beliefs of Chinese students as a cultural model of learning, in which they emphasize both \"heart and mind for wanting to learn\" (p. 248). This also echoes to Hau and his colleagues' research on Chinese students' incremental beliefs of personal abilities and the perceived compensatory relation between personal effort and abilities among Chinese learners (Hau & Ho, 2008 ; Hau & Salili, 1996b ) . It is also important to note that based on the cultural learning model developed by Li ( 2002 ) , there are four types of affect that are essential in sustainable learning processes (i.e., passion/thirst for learning, commitment, respect, and humility). In the light of the Chinese cultural model of learning, it would be reasonable to assume that, compared to competence self-perceptions, affect self-perceptions might be similarly or even more highly related to achievement among Chinese students. This would be different to previous fi ndings with students from other countries which demonstrated that self-perceptions of competence in math and verbal domains shared higher relations with matching achievements than the self-perceptions of affect (e.g., Abu-Hilal et al., 2013 ; Arens et al., 2011 ; Pinxten et al., 2014 ) .",

Moving a step further, an increasing body of research on academic self-concept has extended its domain-specifi c structure to a further separation between competence and affect components within domain-specifi c self-concepts (e.g., math competence and math affect: Arens et al., 2011 ; Pinxten et al., 2014 ) . Although the I/E model has been extended to Chinese students (Marsh et al., 2001 ; Xu et al., 2013 ) , the contexts were limited to mainstream education. In addition, support for the distinctiveness between competence and affect components of academic self-concept has mainly originated from students in Western and Arab countries (Abu-Hilal et al., 2013 ; Arens et al., 2011 ; Marsh et al., 1999 ; Pinxten et al., 2014 ) . We thus encounter two research gaps with regard to Chinese students' academic self-concepts: (1) The I/E model has not been tested for vocational students in China which might constitute a different student population. Compared to students in the mainstream education, vocational students are usually from lower academic levels (Zhao & Lu, 2007 ) and are learning primarily for early employment (Cooke, 2005 ; Kuczera & Field, 2010 ) .",

Whereas the items for measuring math self-concept from the original English SDQ I (Marsh, 1990a ) were retained for the Chinese SDQ I, students' selfconcept related to Chinese as their native language was measured instead of reading self-concept as assessed in the original SDQ I. The Chinese self-concept scale was created by rewording and adapting the items of the reading self-concept scale (e.g., using \"I get good marks in Chinese\" to replace \"I get good marks in reading\"). Each scale (i.e., math and Chinese self-concept scales) consisted of ten items (eight positively worded items and two negatively worded items). The ten items of each scale can be further divided into fi ve (four positive and one negative) competence-related items asking for students' self-perceptions of competence and fi ve affect-related (four positive and one negative) items referring to students' self-perceptions of enjoyment and interest toward Chinese and math, respectively. To answer to these items, students rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale whether the items statements were false (1), mostly false (2), sometimes false, sometimes true (3), mostly true (4), or true (5). The fi rst author administered the survey to the targeted vocational students during regular class time with assistance of local teachers. Students participated in the survey on a voluntary basis. Negatively worded items were reversely coded before all analyses to facilitate the interpretations of results. Students' school grades in math and Chinese were used as indicators for students' achievements in these subjects. The grades were obtained from the school-based test fi les in the fi rst school year. School grades in China usually range from 0 to 100 with 0 depicting the worst and 100 the best grade.",

Model 2 stated a domain-specifi c structure of academic self-concept with two separate factors for math and Chinese self-concepts (based on Marsh et al., 1988 ) . Model 3 additionally assumed the separation between competence and affect components within math and Chinese self-concepts (Arens et al., 2011 ) as the competence-related and affectrelated items of each domain defi ned separate factors (i.e., math competence, math affect, Chinese competence, Chinese affect) . Based on Models 2 and 3, we then tested the classic I/E model at the domain-specifi c level for math and Chinese selfconcepts (i.e., the classic I/E model; Model 4; see also Fig. 7 .3 ) and at the component-specifi c level by separating competence and affect components within math and Chinese self-concepts, respectively (Model 5; see also Fig. 7.4 ).

All analyses were conducted in Mplus Version 7.11 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998 . The amount of missing values for the total responses to the math and Chinese self-concept scales was small, ranging from 0.5 to 1.6 % (with an average of 0.9 %). Missing values were estimated by the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) in Mplus (see Enders, 2010 for further details). The robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) was applied in all analyses involved in this study. Correlated uniquenesses between parallel-worded items used to measure students' selfconcepts in math and Chinese (e.g., \"I enjoy doing work in math-Chinese\"; \"I am good at math-Chinese\") were included in all analyses (e.g., Marsh et al., 2013 ) . In addition, to consider a possible method artifact related to negatively worded items (Marsh, Scalas, & Nagengast, 2010 ) , all latent models included correlated uniquenesses between the negatively worded items of the two scales. Model fi t was evaluated by the chi-square statistic with its degrees of freedom along with other widely accepted goodness-of-fi t indices, namely, the comparative fi t index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). For CFI and TLI, values between .90 and .95 indicate a reasonable fi t and larger than .95 indicate a good fi t (Bentler, 1990 ) . For RMSEA and SRMR, values between .05 and .08 suggest an acceptable fi t (Kline, 2005 ) and values below .05 indicate a good fi t (Hooper, Coughlan, & Mullen, 2008 ) .",

The results showed that the internal consistencies of each domain-specifi c academic scale and their competence-related and affect-related subscales were satisfactory and suffi cient for use with Chinese vocational students (Cronbach's alphas ranging from .76 to .90). Table 7 .2 presents the results of the series of the CFA models applied to examine the structure of academic self-concept among Chinese vocational students. The results showed that the one-factor model without considering the domain specifi city of academic self-concept had the poorest fi t to the data (CFI = .523, TLI = .419, RMSEA = .139), compared to Models 2 and 3. The four-factor model (Model 3) separating competence and affect components within verbal and math domains demonstrated the best fi t indices (CFI = .965, TLI = .956, RMSEA = .038) and was superior to the fi t of Model 2 which only stated domain specifi city of academic selfconcept with no further separation between competence and affect components (CFI = .950, TLI = .939, RMSEA = .045). Table 7 .3 depicts the standardized factor correlations resulting from Model 2. Math and Chinese self-concepts were nearly unrelated to each other ( r = .10) demonstrating their distinctiveness. Table 7 .3 includes the standardized factor correlations resulting from Model 3 incorporating the competence-affect separation within math and Chinese self-concepts. The results further supported the domain specifi city of academic self-concept as well as the separation between competence and affect components as the competence components of math and Chinese self-concepts were correlated close to zero ( r = .09). This was also evident for the affect components related to math and Chinese self-concepts ( r = .14). The strong separation between math and Chinese self-concept domains was further supported by the observation of near-zero relations between math affect and Chinese competence self-perceptions ( r = .08) and between math competence and Chinese affect selfperceptions ( r = .06). Additionally, although the competence and affect components within math and Chinese self-concept domains were highly correlated ( r = .96; r = .87, p < .001, respectively), their correlations were not perfect, further demonstrating their separable feature.",

With regard to the fi rst aim, the present study found evidence of the validity of the classic I/E model for Chinese vocational students. Previous research on the I/E model has demonstrated a broad generalizability of the I/E model across students of different achievement levels, gender, and age (for comprehensive reviews, see Marsh, 2007 ; M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013 ; ; see also Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002 ; Tay et al., 1995 ) . Hence, this study expanded evidence of the broad generalizability of the I/E model by supporting it within a sample of Chinese vocational students as a special population of students who are usually perceived as coming from lowachieving backgrounds (Zhao & Lu, 2007 ) and whose learning purposes are mainly for acquiring knowledge and vocational skills as compared to their counterparts in mainstream education.",

Specifi cally, the cross-path coeffi cients between nonmatching achievement and self-concept measures (i.e., from Chinese achievement to math self-concept and from math achievement to Chinese self-concept) were weaker than found in the I/E study conducted by Xu et al. ( 2013 ) with a sample of Chinese students in mainstream education. This result could be explained in light of current developments of dimensional comparison theory seeking to address three key questions, \"why [compare],\"\"[compare] with what,\" or \"with what effect [these comparisons would produce]\" (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013 , p. 544) , and in relation to the role of math and native language (i.e., Chinese) in mainstream and vocational education. For example, given the less salient role of math and Chinese in vocational schools compared to core vocational training courses, vocational students' motivations to make use of dimensional comparisons (i.e., \"why compare\") between the two school subjects may be less important than for mainstream students (for whom math and Chinese are two core school subjects). Similarly, given the less salient role of math and Chinese as school subjects in vocational education compared to mainstream education, it is likely that standard and target domains of academic self-concept involved in vocational students' dimensional comparisons (i.e., \"compare with what\") might not be limited to Chinese and math, but might also include the self-concepts of other core vocational training courses and subjects. Hence, the strength of contrast effects between math and Chinese produced by dimensional comparison processes may differ between vocational students and students from mainstream education (e.g., Xu et al., 2013 ) .",

This pattern of results provided further evidence of the necessity for the separation between competence and affect components within self-concept domains. In a previous study conducted with German primary and secondary students (Arens et al., 2011 ) , stronger correlations were found between selfperceptions of math and verbal (German) competence and matching domains of achievement than between affect self-perceptions and achievement. Similarly, Abu-Hilal and his colleagues found that Saudi secondary students' math competence self-perception shared a higher relation with math achievement than students' affect self-perception in the math domain (Abu-Hilal et al., 2013 ) . Another study conducted with Grades 3-7 students (Pinxten et al., 2014 ) also showed that the selfperception of math competence had a stronger correlation with math achievement than the self-perceptions of math affect. Thus, the fi ndings of this study showing higher relations of math and Chinese achievements to matching affect self-concepts than to matching self-perceptions of competence were somewhat unexpected. We might be able to explain these fi ndings in the context of the particular sample of Chinese vocational students and the cultural model of learning beliefs (Li, 2002 (Li, , 2009 . The relatively higher relation between affect self-perceptions and achievement might be reasonable in light of the core role of positive affect (e.g., passion/ thirst to learn, perseverance) involved in learning processes, as well as the compensatory relationship between students' positive affect toward learning (e.g., effort, endurance of hardship) and abilities (Hau & Ho, 2008 ; Hau & Salili, 1996a , 1996b Li, 2009 ) . These fi ndings thus enrich the current scope of research on the relations between academic achievement and competence and affect components, which make the present study remarkable.",

Based on the fi ndings of a further distinctiveness between competence and affect components and their strong associations with academic achievement, Chinese students' academic self-concept may benefi t from enhancement interventions targeting to promote both their self-perceptions of competence and affect. Additionally, the differentiable feature of the two self-concept components also allows researchers and practitioners to fl exibly design educational interventions to promote them respectively or jointly. It is also important to note that feedback enhancement approaches which have been found to effectively enhance students' self-concept in previous research in Western countries (e.g., Craven, Marsh, & Burnett, 2003 ; Craven, Marsh, & Debus, 1991 ) and Chinese students (Chan & Lam, 2010 ; Yang & Watkins, 2013 ) can be adapted to enhance students' self-perceptions of both competence and affect in need.",

Given that vocational students have core vocational training courses in addition to courses in math, native language, and nonnative languages, vocational students' academic self-concept may further comprise other important domains. As such, it seems to be worthwhile to integrate such self-concepts related to vocational training domains to generate a comprehensive understanding of the generalizability of the I/E model and the twofold multidimensional structure of academic self-concept among the population of Chinese vocational students. Our study was mainly based on a sample of vocational students from mainland China, and comparative data from mainstream students were not included. Future studies should realize a design which includes not only vocational students but also students from other educational forms (e.g., mainstream secondary, higher education) in China and other East Asian countries. Finally, the present study used students' school grades as achievement indicators. In addition to academic achievement, future studies should consider a broader range of outcome criteria, for example, approaches to learning (Kember & Watkins, 2010 ; Watkins & Biggs, 1996 ) , effort expenditure to school subjects (McInerney, Yeung, & McInerney, 2001 ) , and incremental beliefs of abilities (Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007 ) to generate a deeper understanding of the relations between Asian students' self-perceptions and learning outcomes.",

Hence, to foster and maintain students' positive academic self-concept should be an important goal across different levels and types of education. However, these fi ndings mainly originated from students in mainstream education, and research on academic self-concept of students in vocational education has been limited. The present study extended previous research on academic self-concept to vocational students in Mainland China. The results supported the generalizability of the twofold multidimensional structure of academic self-concept, lending important evidence of generalizability for this recently established characteristic of students' academic self-concept. By testing the classic I/E model among Chinese vocational students, the present study added further evidence of its broad generalizability. Most importantly, the present study extended previous studies on the I/E model to Chinese vocational students by incorporating the competence-affect separation within self-concept domains. The results demonstrated differential effects from math and verbal achievements to the competence and affect components of math and verbal self-concepts, suggesting the signifi cance of integrating the competence-affect separation of academic self-concept to future studies on the I/E model. Future studies are also needed to broaden the results by testing them in longitudinal studies which should also use larger and more diverse samples and integrate a range of outcome variables and self-concept facets.",
