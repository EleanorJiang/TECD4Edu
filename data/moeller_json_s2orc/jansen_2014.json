Such spirited statements have been backed up by scientific research that shows that achievement in STEMmeasured indirectly by the number of patents and Nobel Prize laureates per capitais a good predictor of wealth on a national level (Rindermann & Thompson, 2011) . Therefore, various programs intend to strengthen education in STEM, some focusing on engaging more women to bridge \"a gender gap to innovation\" (United States Department of Commerce, 2011, p. 1). As mathematics and science cover the largest part of school education in STEM subjects, predicting academic success in these domains has become a goal for educational research.",

Meta-analyses (Huang, 2011; Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004) and longitudinal studies (Marsh & O' Mara, 2008) have shown that the relation between academic achievement and the self-concept is positive and reciprocal. The finding that students who feel more competent in a specific school subject will also achieve better results than their equally able peers makes the academic self-concept one of the most influential non-ability predictors of school achievement and, in general, a desirable educational outcome (OECD, 2003) . Whereas there are many studies on the academic self-concept in math and languages, few studies have focused on the self-concept in the domain of science even though it may be an important factor in explaining both students' academic success and their aspirations to pursue a career in the sciences. In this study, we scrutinize the nature of the academic selfconcept in science by examining its internal structure and its relation to student achievement. Furthermore, we investigate gender differences in the academic self-concept in science and the moderating effects of gender on the relation between the self-concept and student achievement.",

                "text": "Different conceptualizations of the internal structure of the academic self-concept have been proposed. One of the first models that introduced the assumption of the academic self-concept as a multidimensional construct, later called the Shavelson model (Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976) , organizes different self-concepts hierarchically. It includes several higher order factors covering different facets of self-concept such as an emotional, a social, and an academic self-concept. Below the general academic self-concept factors are subject-specific self-concept factors. However, empirical results have shown that the self-concept in mathematics and the self-concept with regard to the language of instruction are almost uncorrelated, even though student abilities in the mathematical and verbal domains are strongly correlated (Marsh, 1986; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988 )-a pattern that is contrary to the idea of a general academic self-concept factor affecting all domain-specific selfconcepts. This pattern can be explained by the Internal/External frame of reference model (further referred to as the I/E model, Marsh, 1986) . It postulates that students use two comparison processes that rely on two different frames of reference to evaluate their ability in a given domain. On the one hand, they compare their achievement to the achievement of their peers (usually class mates) within the same domain-a social comparison within an external frame of reference resulting in positive effects of achievement on the self-concept within each domain. On the other hand, they compare their achievement in one domain with their own achievement in other domains-a dimensional comparison within an internal frame of reference resulting in negative effects of achievement in the verbal domain on the self-concept in the mathematical domain and vice versa (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) . These negative across-domain effects of achievement on self-concept explain the almost nonexistent relation between mathematical and verbal self-concepts. To account for these processes and the implied distinction of the mathematical and the verbal domains, Marsh and colleagues also developed a new model of the internal structure of the academic self-concept, the Marsh/ Shavelson model (Marsh, 1990; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985; Marsh et al., 1988) . The Marsh/Shavelson model discards the idea of a general factor of academic self-concept in favor of two uncorrelated factors-a general mathematical and general verbal self-concept. Even though extensions have been proposed lately (Arens, Yeung, Craven, & Hasselhorn, 2011; Brunner, L\u00fcdtke, & Trautwein, 2008; Brunner et al., 2010; Chiu, 2012) , the I/E model and the Marsh/Shavelson model have been supported by a vast amount of empirical data including cross-cultural studies (Marsh & Hau, 2004) , meta-analytic studies (M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2009) and longitudinal studies (Marsh & K\u00f6ller, 2004; Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2001; M\u00f6ller, Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2011) , and have guided much of the research on the academic self-concept.",

Which science subjects are taught in a given learning environment varies, however: in contrast to some other countries in which the natural sciences are taught interdisciplinarily, science education in Germany is traditionally taught in three separate subjects in secondary school (physics, chemistry, and biology) even though interdisciplinary science classes are sometimes taught in lower grades or offered in addition to subject-specific teaching. Accordingly, different conceptualizations of the self-concept in science have been proposed: In the original Shavelson model, the self-concept in science was represented by a single first-order factor (Shavelson et al., 1976) . This conceptualization also underlies a prominent and widely used measure of academic self-concept-the Academic Self-Description Questionnaire (ASDQ; Marsh, 1990) . However, in the Marsh/Shavelson model (Marsh, 1990) , the physical and biological sciences are theoretically distinguished and strong assumptions concerning their relations to higher order factors are made; in detail, the physical science factor is explained solely by a higher order mathematics-and-science factor, whereas the biological science factor is explained by both a higher order verbal factor and the higher order mathematics-and-science-factor. In their description of the Marsh/Shavelson model, M\u00f6ller and K\u00f6ller (2004) differentiated between three science subjects: biology, physics, and chemistry, in accordance with the curriculum in Germany. In their model, the self-concepts in physics and chemistry are explained by a higher order mathematics factor, whereas the self-concept in biology is explained by a higher order verbal factor.",

Whether one or more science self-concept factors are assumed depends largely on the country in which the study was conducted and the curriculum. The allocation of the science self-concepts to the higher order factors of the Marsh/ Shavelson model seems to have been founded on the implicit assumption that the self-concepts in different science subjects can be ordered along a continuum ranging from a verbal to a mathematical pole. In this assignment, the self-concept in biology is located near the verbal pole and the self-concept in physics is located near the mathematical pole, whereas chemistry takes an intermediate role. Despite the plausibility of these assumptions at first glance (e.g., more mathematical formalization is used in school physics than in school biology), empirical data that capture the internal structure of self-concepts in science covering all three subjects are missing.",

Similarly, the relation between academic self-concept and achievement is often reduced to mathematics and languages. In the few studies that consider science achievement, the self-concept in science is either regarded as a one-dimensional construct, or the analyses focus on one domain of science: Only weak relations between the science self-concept and science achievementas measured by standardized achievement testswere found in a student sample from Hong Kong (Wang, Oliver, & Starver, 2008) , whereas others found substantial positive relations (e.g., Chiu, 2008 Chiu, , 2012 . Other studies focused on specific science domains only and consistently found positive effects. For example, the self-concept in chemistry was found to be a valid predictor of course grades in chemistry (Bauer, 2005) , performance on an examination of the American Chemical Society (Lewis, Shaw, & Heitz, 2009) , and the understanding of chemical concepts (Nieswandt, 2007) . Substantial correlations have also been found between the self-concept in biology and a test on genetics (Thomas et al., 1993) , between the self-concept in life science and course grades (Britner, 2008) and between the self-concept and course grades in physics (M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & K\u00f6ller, 2006) . Overall, these studies suggest a positive relation between the academic selfconcept and achievement, especially when the operationalization of achievement and self-concept is domain-specific and when grades are used as achievement indicators. However, a substantial drawback of these studies is that the extent to which the relation between the selfconcept and achievement is actually subject-specific remains unclear because different science subjects are not considered simultaneously.",

Whereas numerous studies have shown contrast effect of dimensional comparisons (i.e., negative relations between achievement and selfconcept across subjects) when mathematics and the language of instruction are examined (M\u00f6ller et al., 2009) , the evidence is mixed when more similar subjects (e.g., mathematics and science) are considered. In this case, both contrast and assimilation effects have been found. For example, M\u00f6ller et al. (2006) tested the I/E model across two verbal (German, English) and two mathematical subjects (math, physics). Self-reported grades in both mathematical subjects were negatively related to the self-concepts in both verbal subjects, and grades in both verbal subjects were negatively related to the self-concepts in both mathematical subjects, thus, showing contrast effects between domains. However, within both domains, assimilation effects were found-that is, achievement in one subject (e.g., math) was positively related to the self-concept in the other subject from the same domain (e.g., physics). Chiu (2008 Chiu ( , 2012 tested the I/E model within the mathematical domain by examining the self-concept and test scores in math and science. Contrary to M\u00f6ller's study, no assimilation effects across subjects were found. Achievement in one subject (e.g., math) and the self-concept in another subject (e.g., science) were negatively related -a pattern similar to the original I/E model. It should be mentioned, however, that the contrast effects were weaker than typically found between subjects from different domains, and, that the effects varied between the 28 countries examined resulting in small assimilation effects in some countries. Thus, the mechanism of relations between achievement and the self-concept across different science subjects is yet unclear and likely depends on the student-perceived similarity of subject characteristics (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) .",

Only by doing so, however, is it possible to disentangle differential relations to other factors such as gender and achievement.

Can it be regarded as a one-dimensional construct, or are the differences in the science self-concepts stronger than their similarities? In order to provide answers to this question, competing measurement models were tested. More specifically, we compared a one-dimensional model (general self-concept in science) with a subject-specific three-dimensional model (self-concept factors in biology, chemistry, and physics). If a subject-specific model was found to be superior, we planned to examine the strength of relations between the three self-concept factors in more detail. We hypothesized that the relations between the self-concept factors in chemistry and physics which are assigned to the mathematical factor in the Marsh/Shavelson model (M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2004) and contain more quantitative aspects such as mathematical formalization would be higher than the relations of each of these factors with the self-concept in biology. We also planned to test the measurement models of academic self-concept for invariance across school track. In Germany, students transfer to different school types after elementary school. Broadly speaking, the secondary school system differentiates between track schools preparing for university (Gymnasium) and vocationally oriented non-academic track schools (e.g., Sekundarschule). In the academic track schools, students have more science lessons and the science topics are covered in more depth which may potentially lead to differences in the self-concept structure.",

In general, the relation between academic self-concept and achievement has been described as positive, reciprocal, and subject-specific (Marsh & Martin, 2011; Valentine et al., 2004) . Specifically in the field of the natural sciences, this relation has rarely been tested systematically and with achievement data other than grades. If a three-factor model was found to be preferable to a one-dimensional model, we expected a specific self-concept factor to be more strongly related to its corresponding achievement factor than to the other two achievement factors. This pattern of differential relations was expected to be found using grades as well as test scores. Because grades are a salient source of individual feedback for students (e.g., Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, K\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 2005) and their best available information for social comparisons, we assumed that the connection would be stronger for grades. In contrast to previous studies, we examined all three subjects simultaneously, enabling us to analyze across-subject relations between the self-concept and achievement. Although the I/E model predicts negative contrast effects for clearly distinct domains such as maths and English, there is mixed evidence as to whether achievement and the self-concept in subjects that can be considered more similar (e.g., different science subjects) are positively (M\u00f6ller et al., 2006) or negatively related (Chiu, 2008 (Chiu, , 2012 . We will, therefore, conduct path analyses to explore whether contrast or assimilation effects emerge between biology, chemistry and physics.",

Consistent with previous results, we expected the self-concept in physics to be higher for male students even after controlling for differences in science achievement. Even though there are no previous results on gender differences in chemistry self-concept, we expected it to be higher for male students as chemistry is assigned to the mathematical factor of the Marsh/ Shavelson model (M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2004) and stereotypical gender differences in the mathematical self-concept have consistently been found (Marsh, 1989; Marsh & Yeung, 1998; Wigfield, 1994) . Because there is mixed evidence on gender differences in self-concept means in biology (Nagy et al., 2006; Schilling et al., 2006) , we conducted exploratory analyses.

Within each federal state 20 schools were drawn with a mix of academic track schools (Gymnasium), intermediate track schools (Realschule) and mixed-track schools (e.g. Gesamtschule, Mittelschule) using probability-proportional-to-size sampling resulting in a sample of 158 participating schools. Within each school, two 10th-grade classes were drawn randomly. Because some schools had only one class, the sampling procedure resulted in 299 classes and a total of N = 7413 high school students. In our analyses, we used a subsample of n = 6036 students who, in addition to the achievement test, completed a self-concept questionnaire. The mean age was 15.49 years (SD = 0.68), and half of the sample was female (51.1%). About half of the students were from the academic track (48.3%), another third were from the intermediate track (34.0%), and 17.6% were from mixed-track school forms. The test session took a total of 3 h; 2 h for the achievement test and 1 h for the student questionnaire and additional measures. The data were collected in autumn 2009.",

The standardized tests were specifically designed to measure science achievement as defined by the national educational standards for science in Germany (for a detailed description of the theoretical model underlying item construction, see Neumann, Fischer, & Kauertz, 2010; Walpuski, 2010; Wellnitz, Hartmann, & Mayer, 2010) . In total, 350 different test items were used for biology, 354 for chemistry, and 417 for physics.

Further, 17.9% of the grades in biology, 10.6% of the grades in chemistry, and 19.9% of the grades in physics were missing because the specific subject was not part of the curricula at the time of testing.

FIML is superior to traditional methods of treating missing data (e.g., listwise or pairwise deletion or single imputation techniques) as it allows for more precise parameter estimation (unbiased under the Missing at Random (MAR) assumption; Enders & Bandalos, 2001 ) and higher statistical power (Schafer & Graham, 2002) .",

As the \u03c7 2 statistic tends to be overly sensitive even for trivial model misfit when the sample size and the number of model parameters are large, we also examined on the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and the Standardized Root Square Residual (SRMR) in case of a significant \u03c7 2 test and used the guidelines by Hu and Bentler (1999) for evaluation of goodness of fit.

Some researchers recommend that strict measurement invariancethat is, factor loadings, intercepts and residuals constrained to be equal across groupsshould hold (DeShon, 2004; Lubke & Dolan, 2003; Wu, Li, & Zumbo, 2007) . Therefore, we assessed measurement invariance by testing hierarchically organized multigroup CFA (MGCFA) models, adding more equality constraints with every consecutive model. Because the \u03c7 2 -difference test is very sensitive to sample size and tends to be significant even for small differences in model fit when many model parameters are manipulated at once as in invariance testing of factor loadings, intercepts and residual variances, we relied on the CFI because it is among the best performing fit indices for these invariance tests (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002) . The suggestions for CFI differences that indicate that the null hypothesis of model equality should not be rejected range from \u0394CFI b .01 (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002) to \u0394CFI b .002 (Meade, Johnson, & Braddy, 2008) . To test for invariance of structural parameters (i.e., factor covariances and regression coefficients) where fewer parameters are manipulated at once and, where the CFI and the RMSEA do not show enough sensitivity for small, but meaningful differences (e.g. in correlations; Hu & Bentler, 1998), we used the \u03c7 2difference test.",

In order to control for teachers' class-related grading and because our substantive interest was located on the individual student level, grades were centered on the class mean (Enders & Tofighi, 2007) . To estimate science ability from the test items, we used weighted likelihood estimates (WLEs; Warm, 1989 ) of a one-parameter logistic IRT model for dichotomous items. The data were scaled separately for each science subject showing acceptable person separation reliabilities (Wu, Adams, Wilson, & Haldane, 2007) for the WLEs (biology: 0.71, chemistry: .79, physics = .74). We used ConQuest 2.0 for IRT scaling and computing WLEs. The grades and WLEs were then used as manifest covariates in MIMIC models estimated in Mplus 6.1 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2011) . To account for the multilevel structure of the data, that is, students nested within classes, we corrected standard errors with the complex sampling option in Mplus (type = complex). To estimate the effect size of differences between gender groups, we used Cohen's d (Cohen, 1988) as adapted to multigroup latent mean comparisons by Hancock (2001) .",

The correlations between the three selfconcept scales, the achievement measures used in the further analyses as well as grades in German and math are shown in Table 2 .

It should be noted that, considering the hierarchical structure of academic selfconcept assumed in the Shavelson model (Shavelson et al., 1976) , the relations can also be conceptualized in terms of a higher order factor model. In the specific case of three subjects, however, a higher order model and a model with correlated first-order factors are mathematically equivalent, at least, as long as no covariates are included in the model.

Grades were a valid predictor of self-concept in the same subject, whereas grades in the other two science subjects did not prove to be incrementally useful in explaining the self-concept. This subjectspecificity of relations between self-concept and achievement is in line with a recent meta-analysis (Huang, 2011) that showed that subjectspecific operationalization moderates the effect of academic selfconcept on academic achievement. When using test scores from a standardized achievement measure, the predictive power was considerably reduced and not subject-specific. Overall, students' selfconcept in science seems to be based on their recent grades rather than on their actual science proficiency as measured by standardized achievement tests. There are several possible reasons for the different predictive validity of achievement measures for the selfconcept in science. First, there is a high conceptual overlap between these two constructs: grades are likely the most salient source of individual feedback for students, and they play an important role in forming and shaping a specific self-concept (Marsh et al., 2005) . Second, in addition to academic achievement in science, grades also reflect social, conative, and emotional factors, among them motivation and interest. Put differently, a teacher's grading may take into account a student's effort (e.g., completion of coursework and homework) and compliant classroom behavior. These factors have been shown to be positively related to the academic self-concept as well (Trautwein et al., 2006) which may explain the more pronounced relation between the academic selfconcept and grades. Third, the individual self-concept is evaluated in comparison to a reference group, normally the school class. Similarly, grades, to an extent, are given in the reference frame of a school class (\"grading on curve\").",

An analysis of path coefficients as conducted in our study is not suitable to disentangle such opposing effects, but only indicate whether there is a positive or negative net effect of the dimensional comparisons (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013; .

No gender-specific effects on the relation between the self-concept and academic achievement were found. Mean differences in the latent self-concept scores were stereotypical in nature such that male students showed higher selfconcepts in chemistry and physics even after controlling for achievement. Effect sizes were small to moderate for chemistry and moderate to high for physics. The self-concept of female students in physics and to a lesser degree in chemistry did not correspond to their ability as measured by grades and test scores, that is, female students tended to underestimate their ability compared to male students. As the selfconcept is not only reciprocally related to achievement but is also a valid predictor of the choice of academic courses (Marsh & Yeung, 1997) and career aspirations in science (Nagengast et al., 2011) , diverging self-concepts may be an important factor in explaining the gender gap found in universities. Interventions developed to enhance the selfconcept are effective when they, first, target a domain-specific selfconcept rather than general self-related constructs such as self-esteem and, second, focus on students with a low prior self-concept (O' Mara, Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 2006) . Enhancing female students' general academic self-concept or even the general self-concept in science will not necessarily lead to a higher self-concept in STEM areas where the gender gap is particularly large-that is, chemistry and physics and also computer science or engineering. Therefore, a practical application of our findings would be to apply subject-specific interventions in order to foster female students' self-concepts in STEM subjects.",

By additionally measuring the selfconcept in other school subjects, for instance, in mathematics and languages, future research may shed light on how self-concepts in science should be integrated into models representing the internal structure of the academic self-concept-most notably the Marsh/Shavelson model and the I/E model. For example, it could be explored whether contrast or assimilation effects of dimensional comparisons occur between languages, math and the sciences allowing for a more precise positioning of the science on the verbal-mathematical continuum. Ideally, such a study should also explore students' subjective beliefs about the nature of the three science subjects in order to describe the underlying processes of dimensional comparison. Do the students, for example, believe that chemistry and physics are \"harder\" science subjects than biology because they require more mathematical skills? And do these perceived subject characteristics predict the strength of relations between the selfconcept factors? Further, our study did not include measures of general academic self-concept or general science self-concept. Including such measures in future studies would allow for the test and meaningful interpretation of nested factor models which have recently been employed to model the structure of academic self-concept (Brunner et al., 2010) .",

Our results may not be generalized to younger students, however, because selfconcept becomes more differentiated with age (Marsh, 1989; Shavelson et al., 1976; Stipek & Mac Iver, 1989) and the relations between subject-specific self-concepts in the sciences may therefore be higher for younger students. Also, in some German federal states and mostly in the non-academic school track, science is taught interdisciplinarily in lower grades which may be an additional reason to expect a less differentiated self-concept for younger students with special regard to science subjects.",

While cross-national studies on the relations between academic self-concept and achievement found no different effect pattern across cultures (Marsh & Hau, 2004; Nagengast & Marsh, 2012; Seaton, Marsh, & Craven, 2009) , it is plausible to expect differences in the structure of academic self-concept due to differences in science education (e.g., the number and nature of science subjects that are taught) given that self-concept develops within the context of the learning environments that students are exposed to. Further cross-cultural research is needed to examine whether the structure of students' self-concept is based on school subjects and, thus, specific to schooling systems, or on content areas and, thus, global. For example, it would be interesting to compare students that are taught science as an interdisciplinary subject with students that are taught in separate science subjects with regard to their self-concept structure.",
