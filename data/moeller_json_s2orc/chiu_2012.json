    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to integrate 2 theories on academic self-concept-that is, the internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model and the big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE)-into a combined model. The rationale for the combined model is that the I/E model actually focuses on internal/dimensional comparison (e.g., a comparison between one's own mathematics and science achievements) and the BFLPE focuses on external/social comparison (e.g., a comparison between one's own mathematics achievement and one's schoolmates'). The I/E, BFLPE, and combined models for mathematics and science were examined using multilevel analyses of 139,174 students in 4,231 schools in 27 countries. The results showed that the I/E model and the BFLPE fitted data well, and the combined model fitted data even better. The I/E model remained unchanged when the BFLPE was combined, suggesting distinctly differential roles of internal and external comparisons in constructing academic self-concepts. In addition, the combined model was examined for each country. The findings revealed that the predictions of the combined model were generally supported for data from most countries.",

This understanding can facilitate suitable interventions provided by teachers who aim to help students obtain appropriate academic self-concepts and desirable learning outcomes, such as adequate allocation of time and effort, sense of control over learning, and maximization of achievements. These desirable outcomes in turn will benefit students in their pursuit of appropriate careers and sense of happiness (Marsh, Craven, & McInerney, 2003) . As such, appropriate academic self-concepts have become one of the major objectives of education, and the understanding of the process in constructing academic self-concepts can bring both practical and theoretical benefits to education.",

The basic I/E model highlights two major psychological processes (i.e., internal and external comparisons), while the BFLPE focuses on the process of external comparison only. Internal comparison refers to a psychological process in which individuals compare their own achievement in a particular domain (e.g., mathematics) with that in another domain (e.g., science). External comparison refers to a psychological process in which individuals compare their own achievement with group (e.g., school) achievements in a particular domain (e.g., mathematics) or in the academic domain. The overlap in external comparison posited by the two theoretical models suggests a possibility that there is a valid model that integrates the I/E model and the BFLPE.",

First, the two domains are two of the major school subjects in national curricula worldwide. By Grade 8, students are likely to have developed stable knowledge of their own and their classmates' or schoolmates' achievements in the two domains. This serves as a major source for student domain-specific self-concepts. Second, mathematics and science are different in their types of knowledge. Mathematics focuses on pattern and logic (Burton, 1994) , which may be perceived by students as containing more procedural knowledge, while science appears to contain more declarative knowledge(e.g., earth science, life science, physics, chemistry, and environmental science), a system used by the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS; International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement [IEA], 2005) . These two reasons suggest that mathematics and science are two different domains in terms of national curricula, knowledge types, and student perceptions, which provide a natural platform to investigate the I/E model and BFLPE, both of the theories emphasizing domain specificity, as is further addressed later.",

An evaluation of the combined model can advance our understanding of not only the I/E model and the BFLPE but also the concepts of internal and external comparisons theoretically and empirically. The theoretical backgrounds, theoretical rationales, and related studies of the three models are summarized in Table 1 and are explored in detail in the next sections. Marsh's (1986) I/E model is the most significant theory to date regarding both internal and external comparisons as major psychological processes in constructing academic self-concepts (Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 1999; Marsh & Hattie, 1996; Yeung & Lee, 1999) . Marsh based his I/E model on three theoretical backgrounds, two major rationales, and the distinct domains of mathematics and verbal skills.",

A higher order general self-concept can be classified into lower order nonacademic and academic self-concepts, each of which can be further classified into much lower order selfconcepts. For example, academic self-concepts can be classified into self-concepts in all school domains (e.g., mathematics, science, history, and English). Shavelson et al.'s theory is supported by research results that show model fit using the statistical procedure of hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis and by research results that demonstrate that domain-specific self-concepts are more reliable in their relationship with important external criteria (e.g., academic achievement) than with general self-concept (Marsh, 1987b , Marsh, 1993 Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988; Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, K\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 2006; Marsh & Yeung, 1997b) . Marsh and Shavelson (1985) posited a revised Marsh/Shavelson model based on Shavelson et al.'s (1976) theory and the results of empirical studies showing that general self-concept comprises three lower order ones: mathematics, English, and general school (including other school subjects; Marsh, 1990b , Marsh, 1990c . Research on the Marsh/Shavelson model inevitably focuses on the two core domains of mathematics and verbal skills, which generates the consistent research finding that the correlation between mathematics and verbal self-concepts is much lower than that between mathematics and verbal achievements. This consistent finding-high correlations between achievements and low correlations between self-concepts, in non-matching domains-forms the second background of the I/E model (Marsh & Roche, 1996) .",

The student's self-concept is constructed as, for example, \"I am better at mathematics than science.\" External/normative/social comparison refers to a psychological process in which students compare their perceived achievement levels with other students' in a particular matching domain.

A typical example is related to the domains of mathematics and verbal skills: (a) The process of external comparison leads students with a high mathematics achievement to a high mathematics self-concept and leads students with a high verbal achievement to a high verbal self-concept and (b) the process of internal comparison leads students with a high mathematics achievement to a low verbal self-concept and leads students with a high verbal achievement to a low mathematics self-concept.

The inclusion of diverse domains to the constructs of mathematics and verbal skills may partly account for the results of the study, which failed to support the predictions of the I/E model. Marsh and Yeung (2001) reanalyzed the data of Bong's study and found that the constructs of achievements and self-concepts in Spanish were much different from those in all other domains. The factor correlations between the global self-concept construct of the mathematics skills and its specific ones of algebra, geometry, and chemistry were .79, .69, and .51, respectively (p. 401), which revealed that chemistry was worth a study that regarded it as a different construct from mathematics. Research has also found that the I/E model is supported for the domains of mathematics and science even if the correlations between mathematics and science self-concepts are slightly larger than those between mathematics and verbal self-concepts across cultures. Chiu (2008) applied structural equation modeling (SEM), the same statistical procedure used by Marsh and Hau (2004) , to examine the predictions of the basic I/E model for the domains of mathematics and science. The parameters obtained for the critical paths predicted by the I/E model successfully supported the model's predictions despite the slightly large correlation between mathematics and science self-concepts (cf. Panels A and B in Figure 1 ). The results suggest that the generalization of the I/E model has been successfully extended from the traditional domains of mathematics and verbal skills to the domains of mathematics and science. M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, and K\u00f6ller's (2006) study, however, showed a different story. They included two verbal domains (German and English) and two numerical domains (mathematics and physics) in a single model. The results showed that German and English self-concepts were positively predicted by German and English achievements and negatively predicted by mathematics and science achievements, while mathematics and science self-concepts were positively predicted by mathematics and science achievements and negatively predicted by German and English achievements. Three reasons for the inconsistent findings regarding the predictions of the I/E model may be possible. First, the predictions of the I/E model are supported only for distinctly different domains if related and unrelated domains are simultaneously considered in a single model. German/English and mathematics/science were too related to significantly show the contrast effect of achievements on self-concepts in different domains or the psychological process of internal comparison. If there are only two related domains in a single model, as in Chiu's study, the results are likely to fit the prediction of the I/E model. Second, the models in M\u00f6ller et al.'s study did not include the procedure of controlling for relations between achievements and between self-concepts in the four domains. This controlling procedure is especially necessary for related domains, as there are usually high correlations between achievements and between self-concepts in related domains. The predictions of the I/E model are likely to become salient if this controlling procedure is included. Third, differences between cultures, test items, and research participants are also possible reasons.",

Students have a tendency to compare their achievement with their peers' achievements on the same campus regardless of college reputations. Davis (1966) used a frog-pond metaphor for the campus and proposed that students in selective colleges were likely to experience relative deprivation in career aspirations. Marsh (1987a; Marsh & Parker, 1984) further introduced the frame-of-reference hypothesis based on research on psychophysics, created the term BFLPE, and extended the research participants to school-level students. There are also some minor theoretical underpinnings from social psychology and sociology Figure 1 . Comparison of the results of an examination of the internal/ external frame of reference (I/E) model-used in the Marsh and Hau (2004) study of mathematics and verbal skills (Panel A) and in the Chiu (2008) study of mathematics and science (Panel B)-with the results of an examination of the model combining the I/E model and the big-fish-littlepond effect in the present study (Panel C).

Two processes are included in the BFLPE: Students (a) compare their achievements with others' in their settings (e.g., classes and schools) and (b) use the relative impression of their abilities to construct part of their academic self-concept (Marsh, 1991) . The BFLPE indicates that equally able students will have lower selfconcepts if they are in a high-achieving group and have higher self-concepts if they are in a low-achieving group. Although there are slightly positive effects of group-average achievement on student self-concept (i.e., reflected glory or assimilation effects), the negative effect of group-average achievements on student selfconcept (i.e., contrast effects) is much stronger than the positive one, and the net group effects are generally negative (Marsh, 1987a; Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2000) . As a result, BFLPE researchers have suggested the disadvantage of selective schools or gifted classes because able students are likely to have a low academic self-concept and career aspiration in these selective contexts. They also stress the advantage of full-time special education classes or schools because disadvantaged students are likely to suffer from low self-concepts when placed in regular classes or schools (Marsh & Hau, 2003; Preckel, Zeidner, Goetz, & Schleyer, 2008) .",

A significant number of studies have provided evidence that supports the BFLPE across cultures (e.g., Marsh, Chessor, Craven, & Roche, 1995; Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, Baumert, & K\u00f6ller, 2007; Zeidner & Schleyer, 1999) . Marsh and Hau (2003) further provided positive support for a cross-cultural generalizability of the BFLPE across 26 countries. The BFLPE is supported by not only correlational studies but also experimental ones across academic self-concepts in general, mathematics, and reading (e.g., McFarland & Buehler, 1995) . Some studies find a BFLPE at the class level (e.g., Liu, Wang, & Parkins, 2005; Manger & Eikeland, 1997; Rogers, Smith, & Coleman, 1978; Tymms, 2001; Wong & Watkins, 2001) , and others find it at the school level (e.g., Marsh, 1984 , Marsh, 2004 Marsh et al., 2000 , Marsh et al., 2007 . The BFLPE is robust even when the BFLPE model is incorporated with diverse constructs (e.g., school/ student socioeconomic status; Marsh, 1987a) . Studies on the BFLPE typically focus on one single school domain, and the most popular domains are still the two core school subjects: mathematics (e.g., Manger & Eikeland, 1997; Marsh et al., 2000 , Marsh et al., 2007 and verbal skills, such as English or reading (e.g., Marsh, 1987a; Marsh & Rowe, 1996; Rogers et al., 1978) . An exception is Marsh and Hau's study, in which mathematics, science, and verbal achievement scores were averaged for each student, and the domain is the global academic achievement. Domain specificity is still an important characteristic of the BFLPE.",

The first three backgrounds are the same as those for the I/E model and the BFLPE: (a) multidimensional academic self-concept, (b) high correlations between achievements and low correlations between selfconcepts in the different domains, and (c) social comparison theory. The fourth theoretical background is the strong, reciprocal, and positive relations between achievements and self-concepts in matching domains at the individual level, as indicated by three lines of research. First, the relationships between ability-related beliefs and achievements are regarded as results of personal matters by a number of theories on motivation-for example, expectancy-value theory (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) and selfefficacy (Zimmerman, 1995) . Second, Festinger (1954) ascertained that nonsocial sources readily available for self-evaluation (e.g., test results and homework assessments) might occur before social comparison. Students may focus on concerns about their own achievements based on some relatively objective standards and form some self-images of abilities before they compare their own achievements with other students' in their contexts, which further elaborates their self-images. The third line of research focuses on the reciprocal-effects models (REMs) of the relationship between achievements and self-concepts based on a developmental perspective using longitudinal data. Results of REM studies show that achievement and self-concept are both a cause and an effect for each other substantially and dynamically (Guay, Marsh, & Boivin, 2003; Helmke & Van Aken, 1995; Kurtz-Costes & Schneider, 1994; Marsh, Chanal, & Sarrazin, 2006; Marsh & Craven, 2006; Marsh, Hau, & Kong, 2002; Marsh & O'Mara, 2008; Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, K\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 2005; Marsh & Yeung, 1997a; Skaalvik & Hagtvet, 1990 ) with few exceptions (Hoge, Smit, & Crist, 1995; Ma & Xu, 2004; Muijs, 1997; Pottebaum, Keith, & Ehly, 1986 ). The REM is especially supported under the condition of domain specificity (Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004) .",

While the I/E model may need a salient external variable to supplement the notion of external comparison, the BFLPE appears to be a theory significantly and basically based on the frame-of-reference hypothesis at the external level (Marsh & Parker, 1984) or social comparison theory (Marsh, 2004; Marsh & Hau, 2003) .

A question that emerges is, What is the net effect of the \"positive\" external-comparison effect as indicated in the basic I/E model (Panels A and B in Figure 1 ) and the \"negative\" external-comparison effect as posited in the BFLPE? One way to answer this question is to compare the results obtained from examinations of the I/E model, the BFLPE, and the combined model. If one finds that the effects indicated by the I/E model remain unchanged because of the inclusion of the BFLPE, then one can infer that the psychological processes underlying the two theories are likely to be distinctly different. In other words, the positive path from student achievements to student self-concepts may actually be based on the psychological process of internal comparison (different from the explanation of the basic I/E model; cf. Panels A and B and the left side of Panel C in Figure 1 ), while the negative path from group achievements to student selfconcepts may result from the psychological process of external comparison, as explained by the BFLPE (cf. the right side of Panel C in Figure 1 ).",

                "text": "To date, there are two sets of studies partially aiming to examine a combined model that integrates the I/E model and the BFLPE. The first set of studies was conducted by Marsh (1990a Marsh ( , 1994 , who placed student/school mathematics/reading (English) achievements and student mathematics/reading (English) self-concepts together into a single model using SEM. The results of his studies support both the basic I/E and BFLPE models, with student achievements positively predicting student self-concepts in matching domains, student achievements negatively predicting student self-concepts in nonmatching domains, and school achievements negatively predicting student self-concepts in matching domains. The two studies by Marsh, however, were operated at the student level, with school-level achievements being disaggregated for each student for the use of SEM, a typical statistical procedure for examining the I/E model by past studies. Further, the theoretical rationales for Marsh's combined model is not clearly addressed, especially for the rationales for the same conceptions but different operations of external comparison in the basic I/E and BFLPE models. Finally, the effects of school achievements on student self-concepts in nonmatching domains were investigated in Marsh (1990a) but not in Marsh (1994) . Marsh (1990a) found small positive effects of school achievements on student self-concepts in nonmatching domains. He attributed the results to a rationale similar to that of the basic I/E model: The psychological process of internal comparison creates this counterbalancing effect that large negative effects of group achievements on individual self-concepts in matching domains should accompany small positive effects of group achievements on individual self-concepts in nonmatching domains. Theoretically, the BFLPE is based on the psychological process of external comparison, by which individuals engage in assessing their relative positions within the local group. The process of internal comparison between group achievements in dif-ferent domains posited by Marsh (1990a) , on the other hand, implies that individuals assess relative strengths of group achievements in different domains, which are based on data obtained from comparison with other groups within a larger context. This process may attract individuals to group concerns, rather than personal concerns, and may further attract individuals to the reflected-glory effect, which indicates that students in selective schools will have high self-concepts and will reduce the BFLPE (Marsh et al., 2000) . For example, if students in a school consider that their school's mathematics achievement is lower than the other schools' and that their school's science achievement is higher than the other schools' together, it may be hard for the students themselves to infer that they are good at mathematics because of their bad school achievement in mathematics. As such, the counterbalancing effect due to the process of internal comparison between group achievements in different domains may be weak. Practically and technically, the extremely high correlations (normally above .90) between group achievements in different domains for most empirical data may reduce the possibility of the existence of the process of internal comparison between group achievements and may dictate caution in the explanation of research results because of the problem of multicollinearity in regression analysis. (As a result, controlling for correlations between groups' achievements in different domains is a necessary procedure and was used by Marsh, 1990a , in his SEM model.)",

Although M\u00f6ller and K\u00f6ller's study focused on the I/E model, their operation of external comparison was similar to that in the BFLPE, because social comparison information is directly operated as comparison with generalized others in a particular domain in their experiments. The typical operation of external comparison in the basic I/E model, on the other hand, is achievements leading to self-concepts in matching domains, the data of which, however, is still at the individual level; the conception of social comparison is not saliently operated. The inclusion of the basic BFLPE in the basic I/E model is likely to further clarify the conception of external comparison.",

Past studies normally examined the predictions of the I/E model using SEM (e.g., Marsh & Hau, 2004) or multiple regression (e.g., Williams & Montgomery, 1995) . The basic I/E model is generally operated using the statistical procedure of SEM. Two typical studies that successfully modeled and supported the predications of the basic I/E model are Marsh and Hau's (2004) study focusing on the domains of mathematics and verbal skills and Chiu's (2008) study focusing on those of mathematics and science (see Panels A and B in Figure 1) . A note to make is that the statistical procedure of SEM that formulates the basic I/E model emphasizes the juxtaposition of all four constructs (e.g., mathematics/science achievement/self-concept) in a single model. The correlation between mathematics and science achievements and that between mathematics and science self-concepts are set as controlling in the same model, in addition to the four major predicting paths from mathematics/science achievements to mathematics/science selfconcepts. As such, it appears to be important to include the four constructs in the same model and to include the controlling variables in addition to the major predictors when one aims to model the basic I/E model using regression, as is used in the present study. A note to make is that one can set correlations between two variables as controlling in SEM; one can also place likely confounding/influential factors as predictors into a regression formula as controlling in (multilevel) regression analysis.",

The earlier review of literature on typical and advanced statistical procedures for modeling the basic I/E model and the BFLPE suggests useful criteria for the best model to formulate the combined model by using statistical procedures as consistent as possible with the procedures for the two basic models. Given the condition that multilevel regression analysis is used, two criteria emerge from the review of the literature. First, include all four constructs at the student level (i.e., mathematics/science achievement/self-concept) in the same model; in other words, predict a self-concept in a domain with all of the other three variables, when one aims to formulate the basic I/E model. Second, include one matching-domain achievement at the student level and one at the group level to predict a self-concept in a particular domain, when one aims to formulate the basic BFLPE. To combine the two criteria, the best model for the combined model will be, for example: student mathematics self-concept (the dependent variable for both the basic I/E model and the BFLPE) predicted by student mathematics achievement (a major predictor for the I/E model and a controlling variable for the BFLPE), science achievement (a major predictor for the I/E model), and science selfconcept (a controlling variable for the I/E model) and by school mathematics self-concept (a major predictor for the BFLPE). This formulation is represented in Model 7 of Table 2 with student mathematics self-concept as the dependent variable and in Model 15 of Table 3 with student science self-concept as the dependent variable.",

The I/E model and the BFLPE were also examined before the investigation of the combined model because there were few studies focusing on the juxtaposition of mathematics and science for the I/E model and no studies to date focusing on science for the BFLPE. Despite this, it is reasonable to expect that the basic I/E model and the BFLPE are supported using multilevel analysis. The reason for this expectation is that Chiu's (2008) study has successfully extended the I/E model to the domains of mathematics and science using SEM, even though an innovation of the present study was to use multilevel analysis to operate the I/E model. The predictions of the BFLPE are also supported, since multilevel analysis is a typical and advanced procedure for examining the theory. Further, if we operated only the group-level variable for a single domain, the opportunity for successful support for the BEFLPE would increase, because past studies normally focused on a single domain, even though science is rarely a domain for examining the BFLPE.",

The scores were computed on the basis of students' responses to four items on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Agree a lot) to 4 (Disagree a lot). The four items were \"I usually do well in mathematics,\" \"Mathematics is more difficult for me than for many of my classmates\" (reversed-scored), \"Mathematics is not one of my strengths,\" and \"I learn things quickly in mathematics.\" The means of students' responses to the four items were calculated and categorized as follows: 1 \u03ed high (mean \u03f9 2), 2 \u03ed medium (2 \u03fd mean \u03fd 3), and 3 \u03ed low (mean \u043c 3), a variable provided in the TIMSS database. The categories were reversecoded in the present study so that larger numbers could represent higher self-concepts and vice versa (i.e., 3 \u03ed high self-concept; 2 \u03ed medium; 1 \u03ed low; M \u03ed 2.20, SE \u03ed 0.00). The reverse coding is necessary because the models posited in the present study need the coding of the variables to represent their meanings in a positive direction (i.e., the higher the score, the higher the self-report of self-concept). This can facilitate the interpretation of the parameter estimates obtained from the multilevel analysis (cf. Figure 1 and Tables 2-4).",

The degrees of the problem of multicollinearity among the student measures were also worth an examination, as we needed to include three student-level predictors when examining the regression models in relation to the I/E model and include two group-level predictors when examining the models in relation to the BFLPE. The correlations between the four student-level measures were quite small (see Table 5 ), except for the correlation between student mathematics and science achievements (.88). The correlation between country mathematics and science achievements was .96 (p \u03fd .001), and the correlation between school mathematics and science achievements was also .96 (p \u03fd .001). According to Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, and Tatham (2006) , the presence of high correlations (.90 and larger) between predictors in multiple regression analysis is a sign of multicollinearity. One of the direct indicators of multicollinearity is variance inflation factor (VIF), in which a value larger than 10 is viewed as an indication of a high degree of multicollinearity. When we formulated a regression equation using L1MSC as the dependent variable and the other three student-level measures as the predictors, the values of the VIFs of the three predictors were 4.67 for L1MAch, 4.71 for L1SAch, and 1.04 for L1SSC, which means that the standard errors of the regression coefficients of the three predictors increased by 2.16 (\u03ed \u03714.67), 2.17 (\u03ed \u03714.71), and 1.02 (\u03ed \u03711.04) times, respectively, because of multicollinearity. The results of analysis by applying the country-and school-level measures, respectively, to the same equation revealed that all the VIF values of the achievements were above 10, with 18.32 for L3MAch, 14.82 for L3SAch, 13.41 for L2MAch, and 12.91 for L2SAch. These results revealed that the problem of multicollinearity was not serious at the student level but was serious at the group levels. As such, it appears sensible not to include both mathematics and science achievements at the same group level (e.g., L2MAch and L2SAch) as predictors in a regression model because of the problem of multicollinearity, for which any regression estimates obtained for each predictor may be unstable and need to be explained with caution.",

Multilevel analysis was suitable for the present purpose because the students were nested within schools that were grouped into countries. Typical linear regression analysis can only deal with data from a single level (e.g., either the student level or the country level); if one aggregates data at heterogeneous levels to either level, the variance estimates will be biased. Multilevel analysis can separate variances derived from different levels of data and take account of different sample sizes in each group. Multilevel analysis, therefore, can generate more unbiased estimates of fixed effects and standard errors than can the traditional analysis of linear regression.",

For example, the effect of L1MAch (\u2425 100 ) was significant in predicting L1MSC given a certain mixed model. For each of the fixed effects (i.e., \u2425 000 , \u2425 001 , \u2425 010 , and \u2425 100 ), multilevel analysis produced the estimates of a regression coefficient and a standard error, which could be used to determine the significance of the coefficient. Random effects were indicated by residual terms (i.e., e ijk , \u2425 0jk , and u 00k ), which showed the residual variances in the Level 1 model (the variance of e ijk ), Level 2 models (the variance of \u2425 0jk ), and Level 3 models (the variance of u 00k ). Tables 2-3 report the estimates of the fixed effects for the predictors. The residual variance components of the intercepts for three levels are presented separately for each model so that one can judge to what extent residual variance components are influenced by different predictors being included in the models. The deviance of a model serves a purpose similar to that of residual variance components of a model. The difference in deviance between two nested models has a chi-square distribution, and the degree of freedom is the difference in the numbers of parameters estimated between two nested models. The hypothesis that a more general model is a better fit than a simpler one can be supported when the result of the chi-square difference test is significant. Hox (2002) recommended the chi-square difference test for examining the improvement of model fit in multilevel analysis.",

The combined model was examined by the use of multilevel analysis for mathematics and science. The predictions of the basic I/E model (see Panels A and B in Figure 1) were supported when the effects of school achievements in the matching domains (the BFLPE) were included in a single model, a result supporting Hypotheses 5-6 (Models 7 and 15), even controlling for country achievements in the matching domains (Models 8 and 16). The results imply that the basic I/E and BFLPE models are solid models and robust theories, the predictions of which are not changed when relevant and significant variables are included in the models. On the other hand, the results also suggest that the basic I/E model may be an operation based on the process of internal comparison and that there may be a need to add the BFLPE (the process of external comparison) to the I/E model. Combining the I/E model and the BFLPE in a direct way addresses the issue that internal and external comparisons are distinctly different processes in constructing self-concept in a particular domain.",

Relativity of their performances in different domains suggests that they measure their own performances in different domains on a single scale (i.e., internal frame of reference). There appears to be no need to assume that the strong effect of achievement on self-concept in matching domains is based on other frames of reference. The basic I/E model therefore can be viewed as providing a unique contribution to the creation of internal comparison as part of the psychological process in constructing academic self-concepts. Shavelson et al.'s (1976) conception of the multidimensional structure of selfconcepts is well elaborated by the basic I/E model, with inspiration from later consistent findings that there are high correlations between mathematics and verbal achievements and low correlations between mathematics and verbal self-concepts. Research on rapid eye movement and achievement motivation has also insisted on and demonstrated a cause and effect relationship between individual achievement and self-concept, the conceptions of which all are tested at the individual level.",

Comparison with generalized others in a particular domain is in line with social comparison theory and multidimensional self-concepts, which forms the two theoretical backgrounds of the BFLPE. Schools or classes are a well-established, norm-based setting ready for external comparison. As such, school-average or class-average achievement can serve as a measure for evaluating the role of external comparison in constructing academic self-concept, while student achievement cannot. In other words, group achievement is a suitable measure for group effects, and student achievement is a suitable measure for individual effects.

The process of external comparison creates a phenomenon that high-achieving schools/classes achievements lead to student self-concept in a negative direction and vice versa.

An accurate theory of psychological processes in relation to the construction of academic self-concepts is of paramount importance for educational policy makers, teachers, and students. The clarification of the operations of the psychological processes of internal and external comparisons can facilitate the generation of appropriate teaching practices for students to develop proper self-concepts in different domains. What students need is not unrealistic confidence but a structure of sound and accurate multidimensional academic self-concepts obtained by internal and external comparisons in order to make sound career decisions and maximize achievements in society. The process of internal comparison (the basic I/E model) can help students enlarge the psychological distances between their self-concepts in different domains so that students can be aware of the relative strengths of their abilities, channel their development of unique abilities effectively, and best use their abilities in different domains creatively for different contexts. The process of external comparison (the BFLPE), on the other hand, can help students estimate their likelihood of unique contributions to society in particular domains.

As such, accurate assessments of student achievements in different domains are still necessary for facilitation of the process of internal comparison. However, the idea of making assessment results a public issue (e.g., norm-reference tests or a streamed educational system) may need further consideration in terms of the BFLPE. There appears to be a need for teachers to increase students' knowledge of their relative strengths in diverse domains and highlight the importance of their unique patterns of abilities in different domains. There is also a need to remind students of their tendency to compare their achievements with their peers' in a setting and to give students opportunities to use a broader frame of reference in order to maximize their unique contributions to society (e.g., the use of teaching materials and activities based on a global perspective). Educators may also wish to know the relative weights that different students may place or should place on internal and external comparisons, by the understanding of which teachers can guide students into an adaptive construction of their multidimensional self-concept and maximize their unique contributions to society.

Most measurement errors can be considered, controlling for using latent-variable modeling. Most sampling errors may be considered using multilevel modeling with sampling weights. Path analysis can model data in a cause-and-effect manner, like the I/E model. 2. Models that include cross-level interactions: Another way to improve the combined model is to include the effects of cross-level interactions. This approach was initiated by Marsh et al.
