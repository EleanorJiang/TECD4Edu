Within-network studies test the existence of hypothesized facets of self-concept (e.g., physical, social, and academic) through procedures like factor analysis and multitrait-multimethod analyses. Betweennetwork studies attempt to demonstrate a theoretically consistent pattern of relations between self-concept and external criteria such as other self-report measures, ability/achievement indicators, self-concept ratings inferred by significant others, behavior, and the impact of systematic interventions that are designed to enhance self-concept. Increasingly, researchers incorporate both these emphases, attempting to demonstrate that external criteria are systematically related to particular facets of self-concept to which they are most logically related and substantially less related to other facets of self-concept. For example, in an analysis of the self-concept/academic achievement relation, Marsh (in press) reported that verbal and mathematical achievements were substantially correlated with Verbal and Math self-concepts but were nearly uncorrelated with nonacademic areas of self-concept.",

                "text": "Self-concept investigators face an interesting dilemma. Theoretically, and from the perspective of measurement theory, it is desirable that self-concept be relatively stable over time. Because general self-concept, and even particular facets of self-concept, are based on such a wide range of experience, even dramatic life events and interventions may have only a modest effect on selfconcept. Some researchers also argue that it is important to a person's mental health that self-concept be relatively stable. Nevertheless, much of the interest in self-concept is directed toward changes in self-concept, as is the case in most intervention studies that use self-concept measures. Self-concept cannot be perfectly stable and still be responsive to dramatic life events or systematic interventions, and herein lies the dilemma. Marsh, Smith, Barnes, and Butler (1983) examined changes in multidimensional self-concepts of preadolescent children in a study that has particular relevance to this dilemma. First, their research identified multiple facets of self-concept that were derived from the Shavelson model and showed that these multiple facets were systematically related to self-concepts inferred by teachers and systematically related to academic achievement indicators. Second, they found that the facets of self-concept were relatively stable, even for young children. Third, they found that changes in self-concept that did occur were reliable and systematic. Finally, their results suggested that changes in self-concept were multidimensional such that changes were specific to particular dimensions of self-concept rather than generalizing across all dimensions. Thus, they suggested, it is possible for an intervention to have a moderate effect on some particular facet of self-concept, even if it has a less substantial effect on overall selfconcept. These results may offer an acceptable compromise to both sides of the dilemma; self-concept is relatively stable, but the changes that do take place are reliable and specific to particular dimensions of self-concept. However, these researchers were not able to demonstrate that the systematic and reliable changes in multiple facets of self-concept were substantially correlated with changes in other constructs, and they did not examine changes in self-concept produced by a systematic intervention.",

Whereas a systematic review of such research is beyond the scope of this article, reviews by Wylie (1979) and by Scheirer and Kraut (1979) are particularly relevant. Wylie reviewed research proposing to alter self-concept as a consequence of psychotherapy. She concluded that an \"overview of all substantively summarized research gives no support for the belief that allegedly therapeutic or growth-producing group experiences affect the over-all level of self-regard of volunteer 'normal,' young adult participants\" (1979, pp. 642-643) . Scheirer and Kraut (1979) reviewed the effects of academic interventions on self-concept and academic achievement; they too failed to find a consistent pattern of results or many studies that produced any change in self-concept. Wylie cautioned that there are many reasons why we should be suspicious of systematic changes in self-concept produced by interventions (e.g., placebo effects, acquiescence to the experimenter). However, when the trends are not positive despite these apparent biases, then the hypothesized changes in self-concept are particularly tenuous. With regard to psychotherapy research she suggested two alternatives; to reject the popular and plausible notion that therapy should improve self-concept, or to assert that the notion is too intuitively plausible to abandon in the face of null findings and to pursue methodologically and theoretically more sophisticated research.",

Many probable reasons exist, but two are particularly relevant to the present investigation. First, most research uses ill-defined measures of overall self-concept that ignore the multidimensionality of the construct. If self-concept is multidimensional, as asserted in this study, then some areas of self-concept will be logically related to the goals of an intervention, whereas others will not. Second, the size of the likely effect relative to the probable error is typically small. This will be the case when the intervention is weak or when the number of subjects in the study is small. The primary purpose of the present investigation is to examine the effect of a powerful intervention, the Outward Bound Program, on multiple dimensions of self-concept for a large sample of participants.",

Since 1941 more than 35 Outward Bound Schools have been established in more than 15 countries. The standard Outward Bound course is a 26-day residential program for young men and women 17-29 years of age (or older with special permission). The course is both physically and mentally very demanding. Participants enroll in the course for many reasons including the enjoyment and challenge of the outdoors activities, broadening their outlook on life, developing character, and enhancing leadership potential. Some are sponsored by employers; some are sent by their parents; some are sponsored by social service organizations; and some sponsor themselves. Historically, Outward Bound participants have been young men, but an increasing number of young women are participating in mixed-sex or all-female groups.",

As part of the program each person follows a personal physical fitness program that includes cross-country runs, rock climbing, and other vigorous activities. Participants travel up to 300 km on foot in rough mountainous terrain, or paddling their own craft in swiftly flowing rivers. While the strong emphasis on physical, outdoor activities is a part of Outward Bound, physical fitness is not the primary goal. Instead, Richards argues that the physical activities are an effective medium for \"the person to recognize and understand his own weaknesses, strengths, and resources and thus find within himself the wherewithal to master the difficult and unfamiliar\" (1977, p. 69) . Similarly, overt, external competition is deemphasized and the focus is on \"the internal competition of the individual with himself, trying to achieve greater personal goals,. . . which form the basis of competition between where the individual's standards have been, and where he wants them to be\" (Richards, 1977, p. 93) . The establishment and fulfillment of personal and group goals in outdoor physical activities, the group experience, and the opportunity to experience and master stressful situations are important components of the program. In addition to increased physical fitness, goals of the program include improved awareness of self, self-confidence, initiative and self-reliance, cooperation, awareness of others, talcing responsibility for self, and the mastery of stressful situations (see Richards, 1977 , for further discussion of the standard course and the aims of the Outward Bound course examined in this study).",

In one of the most carefully considered studies, Smith, Gabriel, Schott, and Padia (1975, p. 4) recognized the potential value of a randomly assigned control group but argued that: \"Interference by the researchers into participant selection and placement necessary in implementing a true experimental design was impossible for this study, however. The decision was made instead to use the interrupted time-series design\" (p. 4).

Richards (1977) reviewed theoretical and empirical bases for the impact of Outward Bound on self-concept and concluded that \"The observations of so many tens of thousands of students throughout the world who have completed the Outward Bound courses clearly support the influence Outward Bound has on the individual's concept of self. These observations have also gained increasing support, especially since the mid 1960s from a growing body of research\" (p. 96). Although many of the studies in Shore's 1977 review also reported that participation in Outward Bound leads to a more positive self-concept, he concluded that the findings were mixed, methodologically flawed, and often confused. However, important problems in the measurement of self-concept discussed earlier mean that it is difficult to disentangle measurement problems from the problems involved in measuring the impact of the program. Hence it is not surprising that Shore found some methodological and empirical inconsistencies when reviewing selfconcept studies in the Outward Bound literature. An important focus of the present study is to examine psychometric properties of a well-developed self-concept instrument and the impact of the Outward Bound program on responses to this instrument.",

SDQ HI. The SDQ III is one of a set of self-report instruments designed to measure self-concepts of preadolescents (SDQ), early-adolescents (SDQ II), and late-adolescents and young adults (SDQ III). The set of SDQ instruments is based on the Shavelson model of self-concept (Shavelson et al., 1976) , the facets of self-concept proposed in that model, and earlier research with the SDQ instruments (see Marsh, Barnes, & Hocevar, 1985; Marsh & Shavelson, in press) . Numerous exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of responses to the SDQ instruments have identified the factors that each is designed to measure and support the multidi-mensionality of self-concept (e.g., Marsh, Barnes, Cairns, & Tidman, 1984; Marsh & O'Niell, 1984; Marsh, Parker, & Barnes, 1985; Marsh, Relich, & Smith, 1983; Marsh, Smith, & Barnes, 1984; Shavelson & Marsh, in press ). Other research with the SDQ instruments has shown that (a) the reliability of each factor is generally in the 0.80s and 0.90s, whereas correlations among the factors are modest (median rs are generally 0.20 or less); (b) the self-concept factors are substantially correlated with self-concepts in matching areas as inferred by teachers and by significant others (Marsh, Barnes, & Hocevar, 1985; Marsh & O'Niell, 1984; Marsh, Smith, Barnes, & Butler, 1983) ; and (c) the self-concepts in academic areas are substantially correlated with academic achievement indicators, whereas nonacademic self-concepts are not Marsh & O'Neill, 1984; Marsh & Parker, 1984; Marsh, Parker, & Barnes, 1985; Marsh, Parker, & Smith, 1983; Marsh, Smith, Barnes, & Butler, 1983) . These findings support the validity of interpretations based on the SDQ instruments.",

Rotter (1966; Rotter, Chance, & Phares, 1972 ; also see MacDonald, 1973) describes the Rotter LOG, its theoretical basis, and empirical studies based on it. Internal-external locus of control is defined as how much a person perceives reinforcement as contingent on his or her own behavior or as independent of it. The locus is internal when the person perceives that events are contingent on his or her own behavior and relatively permanent personal characteristics, and external when they are seen as contingent on luck, fate, the control of powerful others, the environment, or some other characteristic not under his or her own control. The Rotter LOC consists of 23 question-pairs, using a forced-choice format, and six filler questions. Each pair of questions contains one internal statement and one external statement; the total score is the number of external responses. Rotter (1966; Rotter et al., 1972) presents internal consistency estimates of reliability of about 0.70 from a number of different studies. Test-retest estimates of reliability are nearly as high, though they are more varied and generally based on much smaller sample sizes. Factor analyses described by Rotter and by others suggest that there is one general factor that accounts for most of the variance in the total score, though MacDonald (1973) suggests that the scale is not as factorially pure as it was once believed to be. Validity research with the Rotter LOC is summarized by Rotter (1966; Rotter et al., 1972) and by Lefcourt (1976) .",

Because the data collection was conducted as part of the program, there were very few missing questionnaires; 348 participants completed the materials all three times and none failed to complete the self-report surveys for more than one of the testing points.",

Consequently, before the start of the data collection, the program director was asked to judge the relevance of each SDQ III Scale to the aims of the program, and whether the relevance would vary for mixed-sex and single-sex groups.

In analyses of responses to the SDQ III, responses to negative items were reversed so that a response of \"8\" always represented the most positive response, indicating a higher self-concept. The median response was then substituted for the few missing values that existed (less than Vt of 1%) in completed questionnaires. The commercially available Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) program (Hull & Nie, 1981) was used to determine the internal consistency estimates for each SDQ III Scale separately at Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3, and also for difference scores representing the Time 2 to Time 3 change in responses. Then the 10 (or 12) items from each scale were divided into 5 (or 6) item-pairs such that the first two items in the scale were assigned to the first pair, the next two items to the second pair, and so forth. Factor analyses were performed on the sum of responses to the two items in each item-pair as is typically done in other SDQ research (see Marsh & O'Niell, 1984) . The factor analyses, using iterated communality estimates and an oblique rotation, following a Kaiser normalization, were performed with the commercially available SPSS program (Nie, Hull, Jenkins, Steinbrenner, & Brent, 1975) . Separate factor analyses were performed on responses from Time 1 (\u00bb = 357), Time 2 (n = 358), and Time 3 (n = 355), and then a combined analysis was performed on all 1,070 sets of responses, with responses by each subject at each time being considered to be a separate case. Factor scores (Nie et al., 1975) were derived from this combined factor analysis to represent the 13 SDQ III scales at each time separately so that all the scores were based on a common metric and so that mean differences between different times were not lost. Across all responses from Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3, each of the 13 SDQ III factors was standardized to have M = 50 and SD = 10. A similar factor analysis was also performed on the difference scores representing the change from Time 2 to Time 3 responses to the item pairs. Finally stability coefficients were computed for the Time 1 to Time 2, Time 1 to Time 3, and Time 2 to Time 3 intervals.",

Textbooks dealing with the statistical analysis of time series typically suggest testing at least 50 points in time, instead of just three. However, as emphasized by Cook and Campbell (1979) , the advantages of using even a short time series are important, even if Box-Jenkins types of analyses are not appropriate.

At Time 2 the instrument was completed in a new environment on the first day of the program.

Particularly for the Physical Abilities scale, the positive impact of the program was based on the Time 2 to Time 3 comparison, but there was no significant change between responses at Times 1 and 3. The design of the study, the fact that Time 2 and Time 3 measures were administered under similar circumstances and in the same physical setting, whereas Time 1 measures were not, and the interpretation of the Time 1 to Time 2 shift presented above, all dictate that the Time 2 to Time 3 interval should be used to evaluate the program effects.

Thus, the mean difference between responses at Time 2 and Time 3, divided by 10, provides an estimate of changes in self-concept in standard deviation units. Scores for the Rotter LOC scale are raw responses. Responses to the 13 SDQ III scales were first analysed with 3X13 (Time X Scale) analysis of variance, and those findings indicated that the effect of time was significant but interacted significantly with the particular scale. This analysis was followed up with a series of pair-wise comparisons as presented in this table. \" The SDQ III scales chosen a priori to be less relevant to Outward Bound aims by the program director. b The LOC scale is scored in the external direction so that higher scores represent a more external LOC. *p<.01. **p<.001.",

The relative lack of shift, or slight decline in selfconcepts from the Time 1 to Time 2 control interval, suggests that the Time 2 to Time 3 increases were not due to regression effects, spontaneous remission, and other threats to the validity of findings that are typically assessed in experimental designs with no-treatment control groups. In support of this conclusion we propose that a multiple replication time-series design is nearly as effective as an experimental design with a no-treatment control. This position is most defensible in a study such as this where shifts in the criterion measure during the pretest-posttest interval are unlikely without any intervention. When the design of the study, the selection of subjects, or the nature of the criterion make it likely that there will be a systematic shift without an intervention, this position is more dubious-particularly when the direction of the likely shift is the same as the intended intervention effect. Even when the criterion measure is likely to change without any intervention, more sophisticated time-series designs, where there are a sufficient number of data points before the intervention to establish the trend in the shifts and the point at which the intervention is introduced, or both is systematically varied, may be viable (see Cook & Campbell, 1979; Smith et al., 1975) .",

The concern here is not whether a PGE exists, or whether it is good or bad. Rather, the critical question is whether other measures are biased by a PGE so that they do not validly reflect the impact of the intervention-particularly measures based on subjects' self-reports. Conceptually, a PGE bias may be like a Hawthorne Effect, a placebo effect, a halo effect, an experimenter acquiescence effect in which subjects try to make the program look good, or even a cognitive dissonance effect where the time, money, and effort expended by participants influence their ratings (these biases are not conceptually distinct and there may be considerable overlap among them). The possibility of a PGE bias is made more plausible by the fact that there were significant changes in all 13 SDQ III scales, even though the scales differ substantially in their relevance to the expressed goals of the program. It could be argued that the higher ratings on all the SDQ III scales are a consequence of a single global bias or halo effect produced by the PGE rather than by the intervention. Thus, A PGE bias, if it exists, represents a source of invalidity in the self-concept responses.",

It is important to realize that the short-term gains may be valid, even if they are not maintained. For example, in a weightloss program, if participants lose significant amounts of weight during the course of the program, the weight loss is real even if they eventually regain the lost weight. (If subjects' self-perceptions of their thinness were used to evaluate the intervention, then changes in self-reports might be affected by a PGE bias.) Similarly, the physical endurance and stamina of virtually every Outward Bound participant was substantially increased by the end of the program, whether or not the new level of fitness was maintained. Although both issues are important, the focus of the present discussion is on the validity issue. Rephrased in terms of intervention research, the question becomes whether the Outward Bound program actually affects multiple dimensions of self-concept, or whether the apparent short-term gains are an artifact of a PGE. In terms of self-concept research, the question is one of the validity of the self-concept responses in intervention research.",

Furthermore, a potential PGE bias cannot be tested with a randomly assigned no-treatment control group, and so that design may also be weak for examining intervention effects where a PGE bias is likely. Randomly assigned placebo control groups are sometimes used to explore such counterexplanations. Traditionally, a placebo is a neutral or null stimulus given to the subject as if it were the active treatment, thus allowing the researcher to separate treatment effects from psychological reactions produced by the placebo. Placebo controls are particularly effective when the actual intervention effects and subjects' psychological reactions to the intervention are conceptually distinct, as may be the case in medical research. However, placebo control groups are less viable in studies such as here where (a) the dependent variables, such as self-concept and LOC, are based on subjects' psychological reactions and (b) it is unlikely that a placebo could capture the psychological experience of the Outward Bound Program and still not be related to the Outward Bound goals, which are tested in this study (i.e., no \"Outward Bound-like\" intervention is likely to be neutral with respect to its effect on self-concept and LOC). However, additional tests, based on a more detailed analysis of the Time 2 to Time 3 difference scores, can be used to examine the viability of a PGE bias. In each of these analyses it is assumed that if the change scores for conceptually distinct SDQ III scales are similar in magnitude or highly correlated, or both, then there is support for a PGE bias. If differences for the various measures differ in size or are relatively independent, or both, then support for a PGE bias is tenuous.",

First, difference scores for each of the 10 (or 12) items representing the SDQ III scales were used to estimate the internal consistency of each mean scale difference. These reliability estimates, though lower than those presented in Table  2 , were substantial, ranging from 0.52 to 0.82 (Mdn = 0.67). Second, difference scores between Time 2 and Time 3 were determined for each item-pair as described earlier, and were factor analyzed. A total of 21 eigenvalues were greater than 1.0, and the first factor accounted for only 13% of the total variance.

First, the nature of the intervention, the 26-day residential Outward Bound Program, was particularly powerful. Second, the sample size was sufficiently large so that observed changes in self-concept could be differentiated from random error. (Also, the use of subjects as their own control strengthened the power of the statistical tests). Third, the SDQ III assessed multiple dimensions of self-concept that were clearly distinguishable and some of these facets were particularly relevant to the goals of the intervention. No matter how strong the intervention, and how powerful the statistical analysis, intervention effects are likely to be negligible if they are assessed with poorly designed or irrelevant measures. Most research has relied on an ill-defined measure of overall or total self-concept, rather than specific facets of selfconcept that accurately reflect the goals of the intervention. In future research we strongly recommend that these three characteristics, along with appropriate controls for PGE biases, be incorporated into the design.",

(The publication lag for the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology allowed these subsequent results to be summarized briefly here but see Marsh, Richards, and Barnes, 1985 , for a complete report). The purposes of this long-term follow-up were to determine if the psychometric properties of responses to the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ) III and the Rotter Locus of Control scale (LOC), and the inferred intervention effects, were stable over time. Only 229 (63%) of the participants completed the Time 4 questionnaires, but nonre-spondents did not differ substantially from respondents in terms of sex, age, or responses to questionnaires completed at Times 1, 2, or 3, and intervention effects inferred from responses at Times 1, 2 and 3 were virtually the same for nonrespondents as for those based on all participants. Factor analysis of Time 4 responses again identified the 13 SDQ III scales, and the internal consistency estimates for the SDQ III and LOC scales at Time 4 were similar to those at Times 1 to 3. The medians of stability coefficients for the 13 SDQ III scales were .73 (T1/T4), .75 (T2/T4), and .74 (T3/T4), whereas the stability coefficients for the LOC were .58 (T2/ T4) and .62 (T3/T4; the LOC was not administered at Time 1). Time 3/Time 4 difference scores averaged across all 13 SDQ III scales did not differ significantly from zero, though Time 4 scores were modestly but significantly (p < .05) lower for three scales (Parents, Honesty, and Emotional) and higher for two scales (Physical Ability and Opposite Sex). Similarly, Time 3/Time 4 differences for the LOC did not differ significantly from zero. Hence the intervention effects were maintained over the 18-month interval. Furthermore, Time 3/Time 4 differences did not vary across the 27 groups in the study for any of the SDQ III scales or the LOC (all 14 ps > . 1), again supporting the generality of the findings.",

On the basis of a construct validity approach, we argued that a PGE bias was an unlikely counter explanation of our Time 2/Time 3 results. Because PGE biases would probably not be maintained over an 18-month follow-up period, the Time 4 results provide further support for our interpretation and for our construct validity approach. Because interventions that enhance self-concept are rare and long-term follow-ups of such studies are virtually nonexistent, the Time 4 results are particularly important in showing that successful intervention effects are not only possible but can be maintained.",
