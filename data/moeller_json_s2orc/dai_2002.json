The results comparing adolescent self-concepts and parent perceptions show that parents did not use processes similar to the internal-external frame of reference when assessing their children's academic abilities. Parent perceptions seemed to have the same gender biases as adolescents do when math and verbal abilities are concerned. Adolescent self-concept and parent perceptions also had significant effects on subsequent achievement in matching subjects beyond what was explained by prior achievement. The results are discussed in light of self-appraisal of performance, social comparison, and evaluative feedback from significant others as three main processes contributing to adolescents' academic self-concepts.",

                "text": "Historically, investigation of the origins of achievement-related selfperceptions has focused on three main processes: self-appraisal of performance, social comparison, and evaluative feedback from significant others (Bandura, 1986; Bannister & Agnew, 1977; Harter, 1983; Marsh, 1986) . Some researchers have mainly focused on the impact of prior achievement and frames of reference children use to infer ability (e.g., Marsh, 1986 Marsh, , 1990a . Others have emphasized the persuasive influence of significant others such as parents and teachers (e.g., Eccles, Adler, & Kaczala, 1982; Frome & Eccles, 1998) . Still others looked at more proximal processes such as self-efficacy appraisals as mediators between performance and/or achievement and self-concept (e.g., Pajares & Miller, 1994) . As an attempt to achieve a more integrated understanding of the ontogeny of adolescents'academic self-concepts, in this study of Chinese adolescents, I replicated Marsh's (1986 Marsh's ( , 1990a internal-external frame of reference (I/E) model and compared structural features of adolescent self-concepts with those of parent perceptions. I further integrated gender along with prior academic achievement as potential sources of adolescents' academic self-concepts and related parent perceptions. I also attempted to extend research on the I/E model by incorporating a mediational model to elucidate the possible effects of selfconcepts and parent perceptions on subsequent achievement. Marsh (1986 Marsh ( , 1990a proposed an I/E frame of reference model in explaining how individuals develop academic self-concepts, particularly in math and English (or verbal ability). The external frame of reference refers to the fact that a peer group provides a frame of reference or standard of comparison by which individuals form self-perceptions of competence. This social comparison hypothesis is typically tested by correlating prior performance (e.g., grades or exam scores) and measures of self-concepts in matching subjects. Moderate to high correlations have been found in numerous studies with diverse cultures (e.g., Kong, Hau, & Cheng, 1998; Marsh, 1990a Marsh, , 1990b Marsh & Gouvernet, 1989; Marsh & Yeung, 1997a , 1997b Skaalvik OR SKAAVILK? & Rankin, 1995; Tay, Licht, & Tate, 1995; Yeung & Lee, 1999) .",

                "text": "In studying social comparison effects, research consistently reveals a puzzling phenomenon: Whereas math and English achievement indices are significantly correlated, math and English or verbal self-concepts are not. To explain this anomaly, Marsh and his colleagues (Marsh, 1986; Marsh, Smith, & Barnes, 1985) postulated an internal frame of reference by which students' achievement in one domain may negatively or positively influence their judgment of self-competence in another. Particularly in the case of math and English or verbal self-concepts, high achievement in one subject will influence individuals' judgments unfavorably in the other and vice versa. This internal reference process manifests itself in negative correlations between math achievement and English self-concept and between English achievement and math self-concept. According to Marsh (1990a) , the joint operation of both internal and external reference processes, depending on the relative strength of each, will lead to a near-zero correlation between math and English selfconcepts. This internal reference effect has been documented by many studies with culturally diverse populations (e.g., Marsh, 1986 Marsh, , 1990a Skaalvik OR SKAAVILK? & Rankin, 1995; Tay et al., 1995) , including Chinese adolescents (Kong et al., 1998; Lee, Yeung, Low, & Jin, 2000; Yeung & Lee, 1999 ). However, see Bong (1998) for a different approach and interpretation. 1",

This early view of the role of significant others is revived by modern developmental researchers (e.g., Eccles et al., 1982) who are concerned with socialization effects of parents' and teachers' achievementrelated expectancy beliefs and values on children's self-perceptions. Although early research findings cast doubts about such effects (e.g., Shrauger & Schoeneman, 1979) , developments in theories and measurement techniques have established the legitimacy of the claims on the effects of reflected appraisals and expectancy socialization (Baker & Entwisle, 1987; Cole, Maxwell, & Martin, 1997; Eccles et al., 1982; Frome & Eccles, 1998; Phillip, 1987) . Longitudinal studies consistently found that parents' perceptions have a stronger effect on children's perceptions than on children's actual academic grades (Eccles et al., 1982; Frome & Eccles, 1998) . These findings suggest that far from an accurate self-assessment, adolescents' selfperceptions of ability are subjective and thus susceptible to the influence of evaluation by others, particularly parents and teachers (Eccles, 1993) .",

Specifically, whether parents also invoke processes similar to the I/E reference process used by adolescents is not as systematically investigated.

Eccles and her colleagues (1982) found that parents of adolescent daughters believed their children had to work harder to do well in math than did parents of sons. Yee and Eccles (1988) found that mothers of adolescent daughters attributed their daughters' success in math more to effort than to ability more so than did mothers of sons; they also perceived math as more difficult for girls than for boys. Jussim and Eccles (1992) found that teachers' perceptions of adolescents' math ability were biased in favor of boys regardless of actual performance in math. Taken together, these findings suggest that adolescents' self-perceptions in math and English or verbal ability are influenced by gender-stereotypical expectations in society, which are potentially transmitted by parents. Thus, one would predict that parent perceptions of their children's abilities would carry gender biases in favor of boys when math is concerned and in favor of girls when verbal ability is concerned.",

Although the impact of achievement on self-concept is well documented, the effect of self-concept on achievement is yet to be established. Yoon, Eccles, and Wigfield (1996) , in a longitudinal study, found some evidence, although inconclusive, for the effects of self-concept on subsequent grades and reciprocal relationships between achievement and self-concept, although prior achievement seemed to enjoy the causal predominance. In a structural modeling of longitudinal data with a sample of Australian high school students, Marsh and Yeung (1997a) found that math self-concept consistently accounted for a significant portion of the variation in subsequent math achievement beyond what was explained by prior math achievement. However, the results were less consistent for science and in par-ticular, English self-concepts. In a study of Norwegian elementary school students, Skaalvik OR SKAAVILK? and Rankin (1998) found no evidence supporting the reciprocal relationship between achievement and self-concept. Thus, the issue of positive effects of self-concept on achievement remains unresolved. From a different perspective, parent perceptions can also be a potential contributor to adolescent achievement, either through encouragement and high expectations or through active involvement in their children's education.",

It almost perfectly replicated the factorial validity of the four subscales of self-concept. Other research using Marsh's (1990b) Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ) also found the psychometric soundness (reliability and internal validity) of the Chinese versions of the SDQ (Cheng, Zhu, Ye, & Tang, 1997; Watkins, Dong, & Xia, 1995) . Most recent studies of Chinese students conducted by Yeung and his colleagues (Lee et al., 2000; Yeung & Lau, 1998; Yeung & Lee, 1999 ) also demonstrated the cross-cultural validity of the SDQ measures and the I/E model. Together, they suggest that the structural properties of self-concept development are quite comparable between Western countries and China. Cross-cultural similarities and differences could shed new light on the nature and of self-concept.",

The back translation generally confirmed the semantic and conceptual equivalency of the Chinese version (see Dai, 1998, for details) . Three measures of self-concept were included in this study: math self-concept (Math_SC), verbal self-concept 2 (Verbal_SC), and general academic self-concept (Acad_SC), each containing three items.

They could focus on absolute (i.e., criterionbased) levels of performance, because in these schools, letter grades were assigned based on percentage of points achieved rather than on deviation scores from the mean. Thus, performance feedback such as percentage scores or corresponding letter grades conveys information against an absolute standard (e.g., a B means a fairly good performance regardless of how many student received Bs). Alternatively, they could focus their attention on their relative performance within the class, regardless of their absolute levels of performance (e.g., who is on the top and who hits the bottom). Although absolute levels of performance are an important basis for performance selfappraisal, the likelihood of using social comparison information was also high in these schools. For one thing, each class in Chinese school systems, even at the high school level, is a highly stable social unit, with class members staying together for most of the school day and being taught different subjects (except lab classes) in the same classroom. For another, social comparison information such as within-class rankings on major exams was made public and was too salient to be ignored.",

Using z scores increases the correlations between exam scores and within-class academic rankings (from an average of .34 to that of .40 for the four math and Chinese exams) but decreases the correlations between exam scores and the grade-level rankings that were based on total points achieved on the five final exams (from an average of .63 to that of .27). Partial correlation analyses indicated that z scores of the four math and verbal exams accounted for additional variance in the measures of self-concept in matching subjects when the raw scores were partialled out (the average effect size was .14).

The case in point is the advanced class in School A, which consisted of the top 50 students in the 10th grade (the number of the total 10th graders in the school was 295). This class outperformed the other two classes that participated in this study on all of the five Time 1 as well as all five Time 2 measures of achievement, as indicated by post hoc tests (see Table 1 ). Records of their academic rankings showed that of these 50 top-ranked students, 40 remained among the top 50 on their first semester final exams (i.e., Time 1 exams in this study) and 36 still remained among the top 50 on their third semester final exams (i.e., Time 2 exams). However, their self-concept did not show an advantage commensurate with their absolute levels of performance. They scored higher on the measure of general academic self-concept than did the other two classes, 3.37 versus 2.96 and 2.85, F(2, 142) = 7.18, p < .001, but did not differ with the other two in their math scores, 3.42 versus 3.27 and 3.50, F(2, 142) = .70, not significant?, and their verbal self-concepts, 3.39 versus 3.60 and 3.50, F(2, 142) = .56, not significant?. The comparable math and verbal self-concepts among the three classes implicate what Marsh (Marsh, Chessor, Craven, & Roche, 1995; Marsh, Kong, & Hau, in press) called the \"big-fish-little-pond effect\"; that is, students tend to use peers within the class as a reference group in forming self-concepts rather than relying on the absolute levels of performance across classes, particularly when subject-specific self-concepts are concerned. 3 Based on the results of these probes, in the following analyses, standardized scores were used to amplify within-class social comparison information when math and verbal self-concept data were involved, but raw scores were used whenever parent data were involved.",

All these values of fit indices are considered adequate (Kline, 1998) . The most noticeable result was the negative correlation between math and verbal self-concept (r = -.43). Inspection of the variancecovariance matrix (see Table 2 ) indicates that the negative correlation was mainly due to negative correlations between Item 4 (\"Mathematics is one of my best subjects\") and Item 6 (\"I learn things quickly in mathematics\") with the three verbal self-concept items. Means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations of relevant variables are presented in Table 3 . The Time 1 and Time 2 math exam scores with an interval of 1 year were correlated (r = .61, p < .001), as were the two Chinese exam scores (r = .25, p < .01). It is worth noting that the two math exams were more highly correlated than were the two Chinese exams. The Time 1 and Time 2 exam scores for the other three school subjects were also correlated.

The final model added the correlation between the two achievement scores (freed for estimation) but dropped the two diagonal paths, which improved the data-model fit, \u03c7 2 (2, N = 253) = 3.19, p = .20; \u03c7 2 / df ratio = 1.60, NNFI = .97, CFI = .99, and RMSEA = .05.

According to the hypothesis, there would be positive effects of gender (i.e., in favor of girls) on adolescent and parent perceptions of verbal ability and negative effects of gender (i.e., in favor of boys) on adolescent and parent perceptions of math ability.

In addition to verbal and math achievement, general academic self-concept was used as proxy measures of self-concept for physics, chemistry, and English (data available only in School A; N = 144). The mediational model specifies three main variables, the independent variable, the mediator variable, and the dependent variable, and three paths, a path from the independent variable to the dependent variable (Path 1), a path from the independent variable to the mediator variable (Path 2), and a path from the mediator variable to the dependent variable (Path 3).

                "text": "Consistent with findings of previous research, Chinese adolescents also seemed to rely on I/E. The sizes of path coefficients are also comparable to other studies of Chinese students (from -.19 to -.29; see Lee et al., 2000; Yeung & Lau, 1998) . Moreover, the internal frame of reference seemed to be used in science classes as well, as correlations between verbal self-concept and exam scores in chemistry and physics also tended to be negative (ranging from -.11 to -.23). In addition, this study found a striking negative correlation between math and verbal self-concepts, which was not predicted by the I/ E model. Yeung and Lau (1998) and Lee et al. (2000) , in their studies of Chinese students, also found small but statistically significant negative correlations (ranging from .12 to .19) between verbal and math self-concepts. As Marsh (personal communication, DATE?) pointed out, some items in the SDQ, such as \"Math is one of my best subjects,\" almost forced students to use an ipsative frame of reference. Thus, the negative correlation may be a measurement artifact rather than something of theoretical or practical significance. To be sure, such a negative correlation is likely to be a result of a heightened internal contrast between math and verbal self-concepts. For example, when Bong (1998) phrased self-concept items explicitly in terms of an internal frame of reference (\"Compared with my ability to learn other subjects, my ability to learn . . . is . . . ,\" p. 103), a negative correlation (r = -.18) was found between verbal and math self-concepts. However, an examination of the variance-covariance matrix (see Table 2 ) shows a consistent pattern of negative correlations across several items. The item \"I learn things quickly in math,\" which was negatively correlated with all three verbal self-concept items, can be based on social comparison (e.g., \"I learn quickly compared to others\") as well as on internal reference process (e.g., \"I learn quickly in this school subject compared to other school subjects\"). Because participants were not directed to use I/E in this study, as was the case in Bong's study, their use of an internal frame of reference (i.e., the use of an ipsative frame) can be seen as spontaneous rather than primed by the wording of items. Taken into account the moderate to low effect sizes of the internal reference effects (i.e., diagonal paths) and positive correlations of the two exam scores, such a negative correlation between math and verbal self-concepts becomes even more compelling. One would speculate that given the existence of a tracking system in China that gears all college-bound high school students toward either a science or engineering track or a liberal arts track, Chinese high school students may be prompted by this specific educational context to polarize their own self-concept in one direction or the other. Because math ability is quintessential to science and engineering majors and verbal ability and achievement are the most heavily weighted factors in admission to liberal arts majors in China (Dai & Davis, 1998) , the prospective choice could heighten an internal contrast in math and verbal abilities among Chinese adolescents, which presumably would lead to the observed negative correlation between verbal and math self-concepts. Such an interpretation, of course, is highly tentative. Although more research is needed to render conclusive evidence, it does not seem that the anomaly of the negative correlation between math and verbal self-concepts can be easily explained away as a methodological artifact. Probably the most revealing finding of this study is that parents did not seem to use the I/E the way their adolescent children did in assessing their academic abilities. The internal reference effects were absent. Furthermore, parent perceptions of their children's math and verbal abilities were positively correlated, in contrast with the negative correlation between math and verbal self-concepts. Together, these results suggest that although adolescents tend to use relative (both internal and external) performance standards in self-assessment of ability in specific subjects, parents seem to use more absolute criteria in assessing their children's performance and ability. Thus, parent perceptions and judgments may be a less biased source of feedback and evaluation compared with adolescents' self-concepts. Moreover, the uniqueness of parents' perspectives also suggests that parent perceptions are less likely to be shaped by their children's self-perceptions. Otherwise, the structure of the I/E model would be reflected in parent perceptions as well. Thus, treating parent perceptions and judgments as independent sources of social persuasive influence (Eccles et al, 1982; Frome & Eccles, 1998) gains indirect support from this study, although the design of this study prevents any causal interpretations regarding parent perceptions and adolescent selfconcepts.",

Several possibilities exist that might explain the observed gender effects. Adolescent self-concepts and parent perceptions may reflect actual gender differences in math and Chinese abilities, but any single exam score will not provide a perfect performance index. Thus, with more adequate multiple indicators of math or Chinese performance, the gender effects found in this study might disappear. Alternatively, gender-stereotypical expectations regarding math and verbal ability (e.g., girls had to work harder to earn good grades in math; math is more difficult for girls; Eccles et al., 1982; Yee & Eccles, 1988 ) may be a powerful cultural myths that influence both adolescents and their parents, which leads in turn to the observed gender effects on adolescent selfconcepts and parent perceptions. There still exists the third possibility that adolescent girls may convince themselves over time that they are weak in math and strong in verbal ability and that adolescent boys think the opposite. The third possibility is supported, albeit weakly, by the fact that gender effects seemed to be stronger on adolescent self-concepts than on parent perceptions and by the finding that girls seemed more likely than boys to infer verbal ability from their performance in Chinese. Based on the I/E, one would expect gender differences in math and verbal self-concepts to be accentuated. In other words, part of gender differences in math and verbal self-concepts can be explained by the use of the I/E by adolescents.",

                "text": "Using achievement data as possible consequences as well as antecedents of adolescent self-concepts and parent perceptions is another way to demon-strate the potential important role of parent perceptions in their children's school achievement. Given the moot status of the postulated reciprocal relationship between achievement and self-concept (Marsh & Yeung, 1997a) , the results of this study appear quite encouraging (see Table 4 ). Although caution needs to be exercised in inferring causality from correlation data, they nevertheless demonstrate distinct predictive power of adolescent self-concepts and parent perceptions on subsequent achievement beyond what is explained by prior achievement. Although strong empirical evidence for the contribution of self-perceptions to achievement can only be obtained from controlled experiments and more micro-level analyses of the processes, the results can be interpreted in light of our understanding of the processes that have been well documented in the motivation research. For example, positive self-concept in a school subject can lead to increased interest in that subject (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Koller, Schnabel, & Baumert, 1998) , more effort expenditure (Helmke, 1988) , challenge seeking (Harter, 1992) , and intrinsic task motivation (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Harackiewicz et al., 1992) . As for parent perceptions, confidence in children's ability can be a great source of socialemotional support. Parents who have confidence in their children's ability are more likely to encourage their children to try hard and persist when schoolwork becomes increasingly challenging in high school. Parent perceptions and expectancy beliefs not only are shown to have a potential impact on their children's self-concept (e.g., Frome & Eccles, 1998) but also are likely to increase their involvement in their children's education when they perceive the need to do so, which can also be important for their children's school success (Gronick OR GROLNICK? & Slowiaczek, 1994) . Thus, it is not surprising that parent perceptions were found in this study to account for additional variance in the measures of subsequent achievement beyond what is explained by prior achievement, as did adolescent self-concept.",

Such an effort, however, may not be very fruitful because the reciprocal interactions of these factors not only make it impossible to tease apart effects of any single variable but also make such an attempt spurious in terms of ecological validity. Ultimately, we may have to sacrifice some precision in terms of the effects of any single variable but gain insights into a more dynamic, integrative process of how adolescents and their parents perceive, interpret, and construe a reality of importance to both of them and how these processes maintain or change adolescent achievement behaviors.",

Likewise, in the final mediational model, the effect of verbal self-concept on Time 2 Chinese achievement was negligible. Several factors may explain why it was so. Technically, the more variability of the two math exams tended to produce larger effect sizes, with everything else being equal. However, there seems to be more to these larger effect sizes than merely the variability of the measures involved. The correlation between the two Chinese exams with a 1-year interval was much lower (r = .25) than that for the two math exams (r = .61) as well as those for the two physics, chemistry, and English exams, suggesting less stability in performance over time. As Byrne and Gavin (1996) pointed out, language courses such as English (or Chinese) cover a wide range of elements such as literature, reading, writing, grammar, or various combinations of these elements. Thus, lack of performance consistency and stability may be due to the multidimensional nature of the subject. The relationship between achievement in English or Chinese and verbal selfconcept becomes precarious because performance consistency and stability is an important basis for inferring subject-specific competence and ability. In contrast, math curriculum is typically more structured and progressive in its difficulty levels. Besides, as Eccles et al. (1989) pointed out, performance feedback in math is more concrete and more clearly linked to specific performance criteria than is performance feedback in English, which can be highly subjective and impressionistic. Thus, lack of a clear set of criteria can also make ability inference less reliable and stable. Eccles et al. provided longitudinal evidence for higher stability in math self-concept and lower stability in English self-concept among a group of early adolescents.",

If parents, teachers, and students believe that natural ability or talent is more important for success in math than in English (Eccles et al., 1982) , then adolescents will more readily infer math ability when they do well in math (hence the higher correlation) but are less likely to infer verbal ability when they are equally successful (hence the lower correlation). No research evidence to date, however, has substantiated this conjecture. The positive correlation between general academic self-concept and math self-concept but not verbal self-concept found in this study seems to implicate differential inference processes whereby math self-concept but not verbal self-concept substantially contributes to a sense of general academic ability in a hierarchical self-concept structure (Shavelson & Bolus, 1982) . However, the postulated role of cultural belief systems in self-concept formation remains speculative. Whatever the case, differences in the stability of math and verbal performance and their impact on self-concept formation warrant more research attention.",

The way exam scores (or grades, for that matter) are used can potentially influence the results and the way these results should be interpreted. Preliminary analyses in this study clearly supported the use of class-level (i.e., within-class) standardized scores. Thus, each class was assumed to be a basic unit or an external frame of reference and different classes were assumed to be more or less equivalent in the way social comparison is carried out. Comparisons of the results of structural equation modeling with standardized scores versus raw scores, however, show little difference in outcomes. There seems to a trade-off between using exam scores mainly as an index of social comparison information and using exam scores as an indicator of an absolute level of performance or performance feedback. As discussed in the beginning, both self-appraisal of performance (performance feedback based on absolute standards or mastery criteria) and social comparison (comparing self performance with a reference group) shape individuals' self-concepts and exam scores carry both types of information. Thus, when scores were standardized for each class separately, social comparison information was amplified at the expense of information about absolute levels of performance.",

However, Bong has yet to provide adequate explanations as to why in the study, the paths from verbal achievement to math self-concept and from math achievement to verbal self-concept were all negative (exactly predicted by the I/E model). Also, an inspection of zero-order correlations in that study indicates a negative correlation, although it is a small one (r = -.18), between math and verbal self-concept when the internal frame of reference was used (Bong, 1998) . All these beg the question of what exactly the data are showing. One reviewer likewise pointed out the existence of a positive correlation between math and English self-concepts in Eccles's and her colleagues' (WHICH?) research. However, in a study of a nationally representative sample of 14,825 high school students (HSB PLS. DEFINE data), Marsh (1990a) found that whereas achievement indices in English and math were highly correlated (r = .88), the correlation between math and English self-concepts was close to zero. Although the I/E model seems well established in literature with diverse cultural populations, different operational definitions and different instruments used in research may contribute to the presence or absence of internal reference effects. For example, Skaavilk OR SKAALVIK? and Rankin (1995) demonstrated that the I/E model was supported when selfconcept measures were used but not when measures assessing success expectations on specific math or verbal tasks (or self-efficacy measures) were used.",
