This association is quite high in most countries of the world (Haveman & Wolfe, 1995). A wide variety of explanations for this have been offered ranging from the macro-political/sociological, focusing on the inequitable distribution of resources and opportunities across social class (Haveman & Wolfe, 1995; Klebanov, Brooks-Gunn, & Duncan, 1994), to the micro/psychological, focusing on day-today interactions within the family that influence children's developing psychological and intellectual capital (",

Epstein (1991) found that the effect of parental expectations on academic outcomes was stronger in English, hypothesizing that this was true because classroom feedback on performance in math is more explicit leaving less latitude for parental effects. However, it is also true that in elementary schools teachers in early grades spend more time on reading instruction than on math. We could reason that this more intense study of reading would provide students with more feedback on their performance and, therefore, leave less room for parental effects. These two alternative rationales both seem plausible and the literature does not yet lend clear support for either.",

We aimed to demonstrate that parents' general educational expectations and students' domain-specific academic ability self-concepts predict school achievement despite variations in school structure, cultural milieu, and academic subject area. The model was tested for math and native language in two US and one Swiss sample of sixth and seventh graders. Although the measures were not precisely the same across studies, the pattern of results was the same on the level of constructs between the two nations. Parents' expectations, a core variable in the model, were measured by items focusing on the parents predictions for the type of schooling students will receive prior to entering the labor market. These types of schooling are associated with differing levels of prestige and demands (Baumert & Sch\u00fcmer, 2001) . Though operationalization differed slightly between the studies, each measured the length and level of education the parents expect their student to earn about eight years later. As hypothesized, parents' expectations for their child predicted students' math and language achievement even after controlling for prior grades. Like the self-fulfilling prophecy findings associated with teacher expectations (see Dusek & Joseph, 1983; Eccles & Wigfield, 1985; Jussim & Harber, 2005) , parents' educational expectations predicted subsequent performance: high parent expectations predicted increased performance and low parent expectations predicted lowered performance. Our findings suggest some of this effect likely reflects the correlation of parents' educational expectations with their child's domain specific ability self-concepts, as suggested by Parsons et al. (1982) and Jacobs (1991) . The mediating role of parents' educational expectations between prior grades and children's academic ability self-concepts found in four of the six SEM models is in line with prior research (Eccles Parsons et al., 1983 ) that shows parents help interpret the meaning of elementary school grades for their children and that optimistic or mastery oriented interpretations rather than pessimistic or performance-oriented interpretations help to maintain high academic ability selfconcepts. Some of the paths between parents' educational expectations and achievement in our findings, however, were direct.",

By the 1980s the cultural ethos in the US made clear the need for higher education. The MSALT data we used in these analyses were collected in 1984 whereas the CAB data we used in these analyses stem from 1990. This time interval is relatively small, and so, though our model was replicated across this time interval, we would not conclude that the historical change does not impact the model, but only that the model proved reliable within the examined time interval. Most importantly, these results confirm the Eccles family socialization model (1983) across countries. Does this indicate a universal rule? The MSALT model could be replicated with a slightly younger US sample and a Swiss sample. The fit indices were comparable and most coefficients corresponded within a narrow range. Thus, it is unlikely that the relations between constructs are substantially different from each other across the three samples. All three analyzed samples are from western cultures, and more diverse samples from more broadly different countries would need to be analyzed to conclude that the model is universal.",

Parents' expectations were related with student achievement indirectly through their effect on student's ability self-concepts; however, parents' expectations also maintained a significant direct effect on student achievement. In this paper we have modeled the prediction of parents' general academic expectations on student's domain-specific self-concepts and achievement; this allowed us to compare our results with the body of literature on parents' expectations (Eccles, Wigfield, & Schiefele, 1998) . However, such generalto-domain-specific effects are not expected to be very strong. We would expect that modeling this mediation processes with either both domain specific parent and student constructs or both general parent and student constructs would garner stronger mediation effects. Our finding that parents' expectations are not only dependent on former grades but also on family socio-economic status is also consistent with the Eccles (1993) model and other research (Trusty, 2000) . Socioeconomic status explains students' achievements indirectly, mediated by parents' expectations and students' self-concept of ability.",

Therefore, we chose to omit parents' and students' values, though they are important aspects of the model. In future studies more model constructs should be included. It is unclear to what extent the presented results indicate a similar relation between family and school in the USA and Switzerland. The findings could be interpreted in a way that suggests parents' expectations account for variance in school achievement independent from the school structure and the cultural environment. Future analyses should investigate how school structure and cultural environment moderate parents' influence on students' achievements. For example, it is unclear how programs of parental involvement regulate this interaction. Cross-cultural work is critical to our fundamental understanding of the interaction between home and school contexts in shaping human development.",
