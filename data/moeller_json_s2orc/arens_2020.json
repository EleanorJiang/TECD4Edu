    "abstract": "This study extended the internal/external reference model to multiple languages including students' language of instruction, first foreign language, and second foreign language. We examined whether social and dimensional comparisons play similar roles in the formation of students' self-concept related to different languages and whether dimensional comparisons result in contrast or assimilation effects. All students had German as the language of instruction and English as the first foreign language. Students were divided into a subsample (N \u00bc 487) learning French as a second foreign language and a subsample (N \u00bc 481) learning Latin. Invariance tests demonstrated that the achievement-self-concept relations were similar across the subsamples, but interesting group differences became apparent when analyzing the French and Latin subsamples separately. KEYWORDS I/E model; academic selfconcept; social comparisons; dimensional comparisons; languages; contrast and assimilation effects STUDENT MOTIVATION HAS been found to be important in language learning (e.g., D\u20ac ornyei, 2003; Gardner, 2010). Among various facets of students' motivation in education, academic selfconcept is one of the most important and widely researched constructs (Marsh, 2007; Marsh & O'Mara, 2008). Students' academic self-concept is defined as students' competence self-perceptions related to the academic domain (Marsh & Craven, 2006; Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976). Academic self-concept is a domain-specific construct since students establish separate self-concepts for different domains and school subjects. Hence, students were found to depict separate self-concepts for different languages including their language of instruction (LOI), first foreign language (FFL), and second foreign language (SFL)",

This is the core assumption of the internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model (Marsh, 1986; M\u20ac oller, Pohlmann, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2009) . In our study, we examined whether social and dimensional comparisons are also involved in the formation of language self-concepts. We therefore extended the original I/E model to students' LOI, FFL, and SFL. We investigated a sample of German secondary school students, all having German as the LOI, English as the FFL, and either French or Latin as the SFL. Therefore, we could also examine whether social and dimensional comparisons operate similarly or differently in the formation of SFL self-concepts when considering French and Latin as two different SFLs.",

The I/E model is commonly depicted in a regression model in which domain-specific academic self-concepts are regressed on domain-specific achievement indicators. Social comparisons evoke positive relations (i.e., regression paths) between achievements and self-concepts within the same domains (e.g., math achievement and math self-concept) and a positive correlation between math and verbal self-concepts. Dimensional comparisons evoke negative relations (i.e., regression paths) between achievements and self-concepts across different domains (e.g., math achievement and verbal self-concept) and a negative correlation between math and verbal self-concept. The positive correlation between math and verbal self-concepts due to social comparisons and the negative correlation due to dimensional comparisons balance out, leading to a near-zero correlation. The I/E model thus offers a theoretical explanation for the consistently observed low correlation between math and verbal self-concepts despite substantial correlations between math and verbal achievements (Marsh, 1986) .",

One such extension is the inclusion of a wide range of school subjects since the original I/E model only considers one math and one verbal domain (Arens, M\u20ac oller, & Watermann, 2016; Jansen, Schroeders, L\u20ac udtke, & Marsh, 2015; Marsh et al., 2014 Marsh et al., , 2015 . Respective studies showed substantial positive relations between achievements and self-concepts within the same domains. Hence, social comparisons seem to be consistently involved in the formation of domain-specific self-concepts. Across different domains, the relations between achievements and self-concepts were not always negative as is the case in the original I/E model, but they were also found to be positive in some cases. Hence, dimensional comparisons can invoke negative achievement-selfconcept relations across domains (contrast effects). In this case, good performance in one domain entails lower levels of self-concept in the compared domain. In addition, dimensional comparisons can invoke positive achievement-self-concept relations across domains (assimilation effects). Here, good performance in one domain entails higher levels of self-concept in the compared domain.",

Accordingly, domain-specific self-concepts are placed on a continuum ranging from a pure math endpoint to a pure verbal endpoint. Domain-specific self-concepts are thus categorized based on the similarity between domains since self-concepts addressing similar domains and sharing conceptual overlap (e.g., math and physics) are placed next to each on the math-verbal continuum other while self-concepts of dissimilar domains (e.g., math and languages) are farther apart. Dimensional comparisons are assumed to result in contrast effects when two domains are considered that are located far from each other on the continuum, thus between dissimilar domains such as math and languages.

Different languages can be allocated to the verbal endpoint of the academic self-concept continuum; they share conceptual similarity due to the verbal nature; and students might suppose underlying verbal abilities to be responsible for language achievement in general. Moreover, transfer effects were demonstrated for language learning since students' proficiency in one language has been found to facilitate learning in another language (Chen, Xu, Nguyen, Hong, & Wang, 2010; Cunningham & Graham, 2000; Gebauer, Zaunbauer, & M\u20ac oller, 2013; Gottardo, Yan, Siegel, & Wade-Woolley, 2001; Kellerman, 1995) .",

Also examining a sample of students from Hong Kong, Marsh, Kong, and Hau (2001) demonstrated negative paths-some of which were statistically significant-between Chinese (English) achievement and English (Chinese) self-concept. Moreover, Marsh and Yeung (2001) demonstrated negative relations between Spanish achievement and a higher-order factor of verbal self-concept (encompassing English, history, and general verbal self-concepts) and between verbal achievement and Spanish self-concept. The occurrence of contrast effects between languages was also corroborated by numerous studies with German student samples learning English as the FFL Marsh et al., 2015; Niepel, Brunner, & Preckel, 2014) . In particular, the studies documented weak, but primarily negative relations between German (English) achievement and English (German) self-concept.

Using a sample of German secondary school students, Marsh et al. (2015; Study 1) examined an extended I/E model inter alia including German as students' LOI, English as students' FFL, and students' SFL. Supporting the operation of social comparisons in the formation of language selfconcepts, there were substantial positive relations between achievements and self-concepts when the achievement and self-concept measures addressed the same domains. The relations across achievements and self-concepts addressing the three different languages (German, English, and SFL) were either significantly negative or not statistically significant. Accordingly, from this study, one can conclude that, if there are any dimensional comparisons affecting the formation of language self-concepts related to German, English, and a SFL, they invoke contrast effects rather than assimilation effects across these languages.",

Moreover, in the above mentioned study the SFL was not specified; hence, it was not clear which specific SFL the students learned and whether all students learned the same SFL. Hence, further studies that specify the SFL and, preferably, include different SFLs are needed. Such studies would render it possible to examine whether the pattern of achievement-self-concept relations hinting at social and dimensional comparisons in the formation of language self-concepts similarly applies to different SFLs. The study by Marsh et al. (2015) mainly indicated contrast effects in achievement-self-concept relations across languages when including a SFL. Still, the pattern of achievement-self-concept relations across languages and, thus, the occurrence of contrast and assimilation effects might vary contingent upon the specific SFL considered. Therefore, we conducted a study with German students with German as the LOI, learning English as the FFL, and learning French or Latin as the SFL. We thus examined whether social and dimensional comparisons apply to the formation of self-concepts related to different languages including SFLs (replicating the results found by Marsh et al., 2015) and whether dimensional comparisons similarly lead to contrast or assimilation effects when considering French and Latin as different SFLs (extending the study by Marsh et al., 2015) .",

Students in the academic track have to learn two foreign languages at least until upper secondary levels when they have more options to choose courses. English is most often learned as the FFL.

The final selection depends on personal and parental preferences but is also determined by the attended school, since schools differ in the range of SFLs students can select.

With respect to dimensional comparisons involving math and SFL, differences might occur between French and Latin. Given the verbal nature of French, parallel to the presumed contrast effect between math and German and between math and English, a contrast effect was expected between math and French. The expectations regarding Latin were less clear. On the one hand, the verbal character of Latin as a language might also lead to a contrast effect between math and Latin. On the other hand, Latin has a logical and deductive nature requiring reasoning abilities (Ortner, Asanger, Kubinger, & Proyer, 2008) . Given this similarity to math, we could also expect an assimilation effect between math and Latin. 2. Across languages: We expected small negative relations (contrast effects) or no relations between German and English given the findings from previous studies Marsh et al., 2015; Niepel et al., 2014) . When considering the relations involving German and students' SFL, it has to be noted that German is a Germanic language, while the two SFLs (French and Latin) are Romance languages. Hence, contrast effects might occur between German and French and between German and Latin due to the different origins of the languages. A particularly strong contrast effect might be expected between German and Latin. Latin differs from German not only in its origin but also in that Latin is a passive (nonspoken) language while German is an active (spoken) language.",

(2015) , although this finding needs to be replicated with other student samples. Still, the existence of contrast versus assimilation effects between FFL and SFL might vary contingent upon the specific SFL considered. French and Latin are Romance languages while English is a Germanic language. Thus, a contrast effect might indeed be assumed for the relations between English and French and between English and Latin due to the different language origins. This contrast effect might even be enhanced for the relations between English and Latin, given that English and Latin do not only differ in their origin but also in that English is an active (spoken) and Latin is a passive (nonspoken) language.

Therefore, we tested the effects of social and dimensional comparisons in the formation of German students' self-concepts for different languages that are central in the German secondary school system. Furthermore, we compared the pattern of findings across two SFLs, namely French and Latin. Based on the various characteristics of the different languages along with their similarities and dissimilarities, we referred to several considerations regarding the achievement-self-concept relations across languages to figure out contrast and assimilation effects due to dimensional comparisons. Given the lack of research on I/E models involving more than two languages, we had to treat diverse, albeit similarly plausible, deliberations regarding the pattern of achievement-self-concept relations in parallel.",

All models were estimated by applying the robust maximum likelihood estimator, which has been shown to be robust against violations of normality assumptions. Missing values on all variables were estimated by the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) implemented in Mplus. The FIML approach is known to be reliable, to lead to unbiased parameter estimates, and to be as trustworthy as multiple imputation when handling data that are missing at random or missing completely at random (Enders, 2010; Graham, 2009) . The amount of missing data ranged between 0.0% and 2.8% for the self-concept items and between 2.7% and 23.5% for the school grades. Little's Missing Completely at Random Test was not significant for the self-concept items (v 2 (465) \u00bc 468.46, p \u00bc .45), and it was not significant for the school grades (v 2 (14) \u00bc 23.06, p \u00bc .06). To account for the multilevel structure of the data (students nested in classes), the Mplus option \"type \u00bc complex\" was used, with students' classes treated as the clustering variables. 2 This option corrects for possible bias in standard errors resulting from the hierarchical nature of the data. Finally, all models included correlated uniquenesses between parallel-worded self-concept items across domains to account for potentially shared method variance (Marsh et al., 2013) .",

We thus considered the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). For the CFI and TLI, values between .90 and .95 are commonly accepted as indication of a good model fit, although some authors (e.g., Hu & Bentler, 1998 ) suggest a stricter criterion of .95. Concerning the RMSEA, Browne and Cudeck (1993) proposed values below .05 as indicative of a close fit, values between .05 and .08 as indicative of a reasonable fit, and values greater than .10 as indicative of a poor fit. However, Hu and Bentler (1998) also conceived a value close to .06 as a good fit. Regarding the SRMR, Hu and Bentler (1998) recommend a cutoff value of .08, while others (e.g., Kline, 2005) accept the less conservative value of .10. Despite these cutoff criteria for the different descriptive goodness-of-fit indices for the purpose of model fit evaluation, it has to be noted that they should be treated rather as guidelines than strict criteria. Along with a range of resulting fit indices, researchers are advised to base their model evaluation on different types of information including the resulting parameter estimates, statistical conformity, and theoretical adequacy of the models (Marsh et al., 2004) .",

This precluded comparisons of the path coefficients for the achievement-self-concept relations across groups. To circumvent this limitation, we created new variables in each sample, that is, SFL achievement and SFL self-concept. These variables were defined by the French achievement and self-concept measures in the French subsample and by the Latin achievement and self-concept measures in the Latin subsample. The French and Latin subsamples were merged, and multi-group models were conducted to compare the pattern of achievementself-concept relations across groups. To this aim, in a CFA model including domain-specific achievement and self-concept factors, all model parameters were first freely estimated across groups (configural invariance). We then tested for metric invariance and thus constrained the factor loadings to be invariant across the French and Latin subsamples. Metric invariance ensures that the same constructs with the same underlying meanings are measured across groups. Metric invariance is a necessary and sufficient precondition for the inspection of invariance in the relations among constructs-that is, to test group invariance in the pattern of relations among domain-specific achievements and self-concepts within the same and across different domains (i.e., the extended I/E model including multiple languages; Meredith, 1994; Millsap, 2011) . For examining the invariance of the extended I/E model including multiple languages, we followed the approach by Xu et al. (2013) . Hence, we examined an I/E model with all path coefficients stated to be equal across groups, an I/E model in which only the relations within the same domains depicting social comparisons were stated to be equal across groups, and an I/E model in which only the relations across different domains depicting dimensional comparisons were stated to be equal across groups. These I/E models with invariance constraints were compared to an extended I/E model without any invariance constraints-that is, a model in which the pattern of achievement-self-concept relations within and across domains was freely estimated across groups. In order to evaluate the invariance models, we relied on the guidelines proposed by Cheung and Rensvold (2002) . Accordingly, invariance can be accepted as long as the CFI does not drop more than .01 between more and less restrictive models.",

Since one subsample of the participating students learned French as the SFL, while another subsample learned Latin as the SFL, we could find out whether the pattern of achievement-self-concept relations varied across French and Latin as SFLs. Our double-stage analytic approach firstly included separate analyses for the French and Latin subsamples and secondly invariance tests for which the French and Latin subsamples were merged using newly generated SFL achievement and self-concept variables.",

Hence, dimensional comparisons seem to be also involved in the formation of SFL self-concepts and they rather lead to contrast effects than to assimilation effects. This observation refutes the original assumptions based on the Marsh/Shavelson model of academic self-concept and on the subsequently established DCT that assimilation effects should occur between domains located close to each other (e.g., near the verbal endpoint) on the math-verbal continuum (Marsh, 1990; Marsh et al., 2014) and between domains that might be based on similar abilities (M\u20ac oller et al., 2015) .

Moreover, from this study, we learned that dimensional comparisons mainly leading to contrast effects are involved in the formation of language self-concepts. Still, teachers and parents might infer that a student who is performing well in one language will perform well and be talented not only in that but also in other languages. From a teachers' and parents' perspective, this is comprehensible given the substantive correlations among language achievements and the well-known transfer effects between languages (Chen et al., 2010; Cunningham & Graham, 2000; Gebauer et al., 2013; Gottardo et al., 2001; Kellerman, 1995) . In addition, previous studies demonstrated that teachers and parents do not take dimensional comparisons into account when they are asked to infer their students' or children's academic self-concepts (Dai, 2002; Helm, M\u20ac uller-Kalthoff, Mukowski, & M\u20ac oller, 2018) . Hence, parents and teachers might underestimate the domain specificity of language self-concepts and the operation of dimensional comparisons in their formation. We would like to raise teachers' and parents' awareness of the existence of dimensional comparisons in students' formation of language self-concepts. Moreover, we would like to point out that students' language self-concepts as the subjective representations of one's language achievement behave differently compared to students' language achievements. Hence, teachers and parents should not solely focus on the enhancement of one language self-concept and feel confident that the positive intervention effects will spill over to other language self-concepts. Each domain-specific language self-concept should rather be treated and fostered separately in interventions. Moreover, the above mentioned insights might help practitioners understand that an individual student performing well in two languages can nevertheless display a relatively high self-concept in one language and a relatively low selfconcept in another.",

Teachers and parents may intentionally emphasize similarities of different languages to boost an individual student's self-concept related to a specific language when this student has already performed well in another language. Hence, in this case, transfer effects between languages should be initiated in order that students' good achievement in one language does not only positively affect students' self-concept in the same but also in another language (i.e., triggering assimilation effects and reducing contrast effects). In the event that an individual student has not succeeded in language learning so far, it might be prudent to underline the dissimilarities between the so far learned language and a new language. Thereby, contrast effects should be sought that help establish or preserve a high level of selfconcept related to one language even in the case of poor achievement in another language.",

With longitudinal data, research has demonstrated that achievement and self-concept are reciprocally interrelated across time (reciprocal effects model, REM; Marsh & Craven, 2006 ). Yet, reciprocal relations between achievement and self-concept were predominantly examined within one domain only. The reciprocal I/E (RI/E) model combines the REM with the I/E model and examines the longitudinal relations between achievement and self-concepts within the same and across different domains (M\u20ac oller, Retelsdorf, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2011) .

Hence, the study suffers from limited generalizability as it is unclear whether the findings are applicable to students from other countries or educational systems and to students with another LOI and learning different languages as the FFL and the SFL.

Its innovative contribution is due to the inclusion of three languages (LOI, FFL, and SFL), whereby we integrated French and Latin as two SFLs. Our findings indicated that social comparisons consistently operate in the formation of students' language self-concepts, including FFL and SFL self-concepts. Dimensional comparisons also take place in the formation of students' language self-concepts. Dimensional comparisons primarily led to contrast effects not only between math and languages but even among different languages. Although invariance tests implied similar achievement-self-concept relations across students learning French and students learning Latin as the SFL, some small differences became apparent when scrutinizing the French and Latin subsamples separately. Based on the complex pattern of findings, we identified some factors, encompassing (dis)similarities between languages, which might affect the results from I/E model studies including different languages. Hence, we proposed some guidelines for future research and indicated refinements on DCT. Finally, we advised practitioners to consider the domain specificity of students' language self-concepts and the role of dimensional comparisons in their formation. Notes 1. The gender ratio differed across the subsamples (v(1, n \u00bc 968)\u00bc19.674, p\u00bc.000). T-tests demonstrated no differences in the school grades between the French and Latin subsamples except for higher mean chemistry grades in the Latin subsample than in the French subsample (t (623)=-2.419, p<.05). 2. Given that the models analyzed here contained more free parameters than number of clusters, the standard errors of the model parameters may not be trustworthy. We therefore conducted all models without any cluster variables (see Tables S6 to S12 of the Online Supplements). The pattern of findings was similar although the significance level varied in some cases.",
