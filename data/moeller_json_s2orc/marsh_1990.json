However, general or global self-concept is relatively uncorrelated with academic achievement, and even academic selfconcept is only moderately correlated with achievement (e.g., Byrne, 1984; Hansford & Hattie, 1982; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988) . This has led some to question the validity of the academic self-concept reports or to suggest that the selfreports are biased.

Academic self-concept measures may lack validity for the purpose of predicting academic achievement, but this is not their intended purpose. It also follows that academic achievement measures lack validity for the purpose of predicting academic self-concept. When there are systematic differences between academic self-concept and achievement, it is important to determine why these differences exist in order to better understand both constructs. One such explanation is that self-perceptions must be evaluated in relation to frames of reference and that these frames of reference may differ from those used to evaluate objective indicators of achievement or those used by external observers. Social psychological and psychophysical research provides ample evidence that changes in the frame of reference can substantially alter psychological judgments (e.g., Sherif & Sherif, 1969) . The purpose of the present investigation is to integrate previous theory and research on two frame of reference effects: the big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE; Marsh, 1987; Marsh & Parker, 1984) and the internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model (Marsh, 1986; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988) .",

More recently, self-concept theory has stressed the multidimensionality of self-concept, and empirical studies have identified distinct, a priori facets of self-concept. For example, in their review of research stimulated by the Shavelson (Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976 ) model of self-concept, Marsh and Shavelson (1985) concluded that the relations between self-concept and other constructs cannot be adequately understood if this multidimensionality is ignored. Support for this conclusion is particularly strong for academic self-concept and its relation to academic achievement (Byrne, 1984; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988) .",

The self-concept hierarchy, however, was weaker and more complicated than originally anticipated, and led to a revision of the model. Of particular relevance to the present investigation, Shavelson et al. (1976) originally posited that the different areas of academic self-concept (e.g., English and math self-concept) would be substantially correlated and could be incorporated into a single higher-order facet of academic self-concept. In contrast to these predictions, a growing body of research has shown that English and math self-concepts are relatively uncorrelated (Marsh, 1986) and require two higher-order facets of academic self-conceptverbal/academic and math/academic-instead of just one (Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988) . The I/E frame of reference model described in the next section was developed to account for this extreme separation in math and English selfconcepts.",

According to the I/E model, math and English self-concepts are formed in relation to both external and internal comparisons or frames of reference. Using an external reference, students compare self-perceptions of their math and English skills with the perceived skills of other students. This external, relativistic impression serves as one basis for their math and English self-concepts. The I/E model further posits an internal comparison process for which each student compares his or her self-perceived math skills with his or her own self-perceived English skills. This internal, relativistic impression serves as a second basis for math and English self-concepts. To clarify how these frames of reference work, consider students who accurately perceive their math and English skills to be below average but whose math skills are better than their English skills. These students have math skills that are below average relative to other students (an external comparison) but above average relative to their English skills (an internal comparison). Depending on how these two components are weighted, these students may have average or even above-average math self-concepts despite their poor math skills. According to this model, poor students will have what appear to be unrealistically high selfconcepts in their best academic subjects, whereas good students will have what appear to be unrealistically low selfconcepts in their poorest academic subjects.",

English and math achievements are substantially correlated. Hence, this external comparison process should lead to a positive correlation between English selfconcept and math self-concept as originally anticipated in the Shavelson model. The internal comparison process, though more unusual in other theoretical accounts, is like the compensatory model described by Byrne (1984) and by Winne and Marx (1981) . Because self-perceptions of math achievement and of English achievement are compared with each other, it is the difference between the two that contributes to a high self-concept in one area or the other. Hence, the internal process should lead to a negative correlation between English self-concept and math self-concept. The joint operation of both processes, depending on the relative strength of each, will lead to the near-zero correlations that have been observed in empirical research.",

According to the model, perceiving oneself to have good mathematics skills detracts from English self-concept independent of English skills, and perceiving oneself to have good English skills detracts from math self-concept independent of mathematics skills. Tests of the I/E model (Marsh, 1986) have used path analyses in which English and math achievements are related to English and math self-concepts. In this model, academic achievement is hypothesized to be one causal determinant of academic selfconcept, but this hypothesis does not argue against a more dynamic model where subsequent levels of academic achievement and self-concept are each determined by prior levels of achievement and self-concept (i.e., the self-concept/achievement relation is reciprocal).",

                "text": "Students, because of de facto or systematic selection processes, often find themselves in a school setting where the average ability of their classmates differs substantially from the average ability levels in other schools. Logic and theory suggest alternative, competing effects that this situation may have on academic self-concept (e.g., Felson, 1981; Felson & Reed, 1986; Festinger, 1954; Goethals, 1986; Kelley, 1952) . For example, being an average-ability student in a high-ability group of classmates may affect academic self-concept such that it is (a) below average because the basis of comparison is the performance of above-average students (i.e., a BFLPE or contrast effect), (b) above average by virtue of membership in the high-ability grouping (i.e., a reflected glory, group identification, or assimilation effect), or (c) average because it is unaffected by the immediate context of the other students, or because (a) and (b) occur simultaneously and cancel each other. The net effect of school-average ability on academic self-concept represents the combined influence of these competing effects (see Felson & Reed, 1986) . Marsh (1987; Marsh & Parker, 1984) found that equally able students have lower academic self-concepts when they attend schools where the school-average ability level is higher. He labeled this effect as the BFLPE and posited a frame-ofreference model to explain it. In this respect, the BFLPE is a special case of the external comparison process posited in the I/E model. The BFLPE is also one specific example of more general frame-of-reference effects that have been studied widely by social psychologists (e.g., Sherif & Sherif, 1969; Upshaw, 1969) and physicists (e.g., Helson, 1964) . Consistent with this previous research, the standard of comparison was operationalized as the average ability level of students in the school (hereafter called school-average ability). The theoretical model used to explain the BFLPE (Marsh, 1984b) posits that students will use this standard of comparison in forming self-concepts. Thus, equally able students will have lower selfperceived academic skills and lower academic self-concepts in high-ability schools than in low-ability schools because students in high-ability schools compare themselves with more able students than do students in low-ability schools.",

Marsh (1987; Marsh and Parker, 1984) described the practical implications for parents who consider the possibility of placing their children in selective, high-ability schools; this will apparently produce a lower academic self-concept. At least for some children, the early formation of a self-image of themselves as poor students may be more detrimental than the possible benefits of attending a high-ability school. Davis (1966) described an effect similar to the BFLPE in a study of the career aspirations of college men. He concluded: \"The aphorism 'It is better to be a big frog in a small pond than a small frog in a big pond' is not perfect advice, but it is not trivial\" (p. 31) and warned that \"counselors and parents might well consider the drawbacks as well as the advantages of sending their boy to a 'fine' college, if, when doing so, it is fairly certain that he will end up in the bottom ranks of his graduating class\" (p. 31).",

                "text": "The existence of the BFLPE has been supported by research using a wide variety of different experimental and analytical approaches. Using path analysis, Marsh and Parker (1984) found that when individual ability level was controlled, school-average ability affected academic self-concept negatively; equally able students had lower academic self-concepts when they attended high-ability schools. Marsh (1987) and Bachman and O'Malley (1986) found similar effects in path analytic studies of high school students using the large, nationally representative Youth in Transition data. Bachman and O'Malley, however, excluded all Black students and all predominantly Black schools, thereby reducing the variability of school-average ability. For this truncated sample, they reported a smaller BFLPE than did Marsh (1987) for his analysis of the entire sample. Marsh (1987) demonstrated that the theoretical model used to explain the BFLPE predicts that the size of the BFLPE will be directly related to the variability of school-average ability. Thus, the model is consistent with the Bachman and O'Malley and Marsh (1987) results. Schwarzer, Jerusalem, and Lange (1983;  also see Jerusalem, 1984) examined the self-concepts of West German students who moved from nonselective, heterogeneous primary schools to secondary schools that were streamed on the basis of academic achievement. At the transition point, students who were selected to enter subsequently the high-ability schools had substantially higher academic self-concepts than those entering the low-ability schools, but the two groups did not differ in academic self-concept by the end of their first year in the new schools. Path analyses indicated that the direct effect of school type on academic self-concept was negative. Strang, Smith, and Rogers (1978) tested the self-concepts of academically disadvantaged children who attended some classes with other disadvantaged children and other classes with nondisadvantaged children. These academically disadvantaged children were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group was given a manipulation to enhance the salience of their membership in the regular classrooms with nondisadvantaged children, and these children reported lower self-concepts than their control group. Schneider, Qegg, Byrne, Ledingham, and Crombie (1989) found that gifted students in Grades 5, 8 and 10 who were in special programs had lower academic self-concepts than matched students in regular classes. The two groups did not, however, differ on social and physical self-concepts. In a meta-analysis of studies of the effect of homogeneous ability grouping on a self-concept, Kulik (1985;  also see Kulik & Kulik, 1982; Marsh, 1984a) found that high-ability students tended to have lower self-concepts when placed in streamed classes of students with similar abilities than did ungrouped comparison groups. In contrast, low-ability students tended to have higher self-concepts in streamed classes than in the ungrouped comparison groups. Marsh and Parker (1984) argued that the context effects due to school-average ability should affect academic selfconcept but should have little effect on nonacademic or general self-concept. Support for these predictions comes from three studies (Bachman & O'Malley, 1986; Marsh, 1987; Marsh & Parker, 1984 ; also see Schneider et al., 1989 ) that examined the effects of school-average ability on both academic and nonacademic or general measures of self-concept. In this respect, the effect of school-average academic ability appears to be reasonably content specific to academic selfconcept.",

In each of studies described earlier, the school achievement context was inferred from global academic performance measures and the context effects were inferred from global measures of academic self-concept. This use of global achievement, school-average global achievement, and global academic self-concept is consistent with the historical tendency to consider academic self-concept as a relatively unidimensional construct. More recent research, however, such as that leading to the revision of the Shavelson et al. (1976) model and the development of the I/E model, indicates that math and English self-concepts are relatively uncorrelated and cannot be adequately represented as a single dimension of academic self-concept. An extension of the I/E model suggests the possibility that school-average measures of mathematics and English differentially affect math and English self-concepts.",

The sophomore cohort initially involved a two-stage probability sample of 1,015 high schools and approximately 36 sophomores within each of these high schools. The second follow-up consisted of a probability sample of 14,825 of the original sample. Included on the commercially available data file for the second follow-up study are variables collected in 1980, when respondents were high school sophomores; in 1982, when most respondents were high school seniors; and in 1984, 2 years after the normal time of high school graduation. All variables used here come from the 1980 survey when the respondents were sophomores (the self-concept measures emphasized here were only administered during the sophomore year). These responses were weighted so as to take into account the disproportionate sampling of specified subgroups in the HSB design (NCES , Table 3 .5-1). Because of the cluster sampling in the HSB study, standard errors based on the assumption of simple random sampling substantially underestimate the sampling variability in summary statistics and distort tests of statistical significance. In order to compensate for this bias, the weight for each student was divided by the estimated design effect of Note. The 18 measured variables shown in Figure 1 are numbered 1 to 18. The variable label names used to identify each of these variables on the High School and Beyond data file (see NCES, 1986) are presented in parentheses. * The development of the achievement tests and their psychometric properties are described in detail by Heyns and Hilton (1982) . b The average correlations among reading items and among math items were both .38, and coefficients alpha estimates of internal consistency were .79.

Perhaps the most serious weakness is the assumption that the single score typically used to infer each construct is measured without error. Particularly when multiple indicators of the inferred constructs are available, structural equation modeling provides important advantages. In particular, the relations between each latent construct and its multiple indicators (i.e., factor loadings) and the uniquenesses associated with each measured variable are incorporated into the analysis. Unlike classical measurement approaches, the uniquenesses are not required to be independent. This is important in studies such as the present one in which the assumption of uncorrelated uniquenesses is problematic. Because the same achievement tests were used to infer individual and schoolaverage achievement scores, the uniquenesses representing the individual and school-average scores on the same test are likely to be correlated. Also, because the wording of the four math self-concept items is parallel to the wording of the four English self-concept items (see Table 1 ), the uniquenesses associated with each pair of items having the same wording are likely to be correlated. Whereas these a priori hypotheses about the measurement model are plausible, the comparison of the alternative models provides empirical tests of these assumptions. More important, if these assumptions are supported, then conventional approaches to testing the path models would be inappropriate, and the implications of these violations would be difficult to evaluate. The structural model contains estimates of causal relations between the latent constructs (i.e., path coefficients) that are corrected for measurement error.",

On the basis of theory, the logic of the data, and, perhaps, previous analyses, the researcher typically posits a set of alternative models designed to explain relations among the measured variables. The problem of goodness of fit is how but the appropriate value may differ depending on the variable and the analysis. Particularly for multilevel data like those used here (students nested within schools) hierarchical linear modeling approaches described by Raudenbush (1988;  also see Burstein, 1980; Goldstein, 1987) may provide a useful approach to this problem. Unfortunately, procedures for applying these new techniques to latent constructs inferred from multiple indicators have not yet been developed, so I chose to use the LISREL approach. It is to be hoped that the hierarchical linear modeling approach will eventually be incorporated into the LISREL approach so that the advantages of both approaches can be realized.",

First, not only are all the predictions based on the original I/E model and its extension satisfied, but there is a striking symmetry in the size of the substantively important parameter estimates for the math and English constructs ( Figure IB) . This symmetry supports the generality of the hypothesized processes. Second, though not specifically predicted a priori, school-average mathematics has a weak positive effect on English self-concept (e.g., if I am in a school in which other students are mathematical geniuses, my math self-concept may suffer but my English self-concept may be a bit higher) and school-average English has a weak positive effect on math self-concept. These effects are consistent with the general observation that a variable that affects either one of the academic self-concepts has the opposite effect on the other academic self-concept. This pattern of counterbalancing effects apparently reflects the internal comparison process described as part of the I/E model. Third, the school-average scores for math and English achievement are very highly correlated. The .72 in Figure IB reflects the residual covariation after partialling out effects due to individual math and English achievements. The actual correlation between these two constructs without partialling out any other effects is .95. This extremely high correlation means that the school contexts of math and of English achievements are very similar. Because the school contexts in relation to these two subjects are so similar, the amount of variance in the self-concept measures that can be explained by these differences is limited. Whereas this similarity in the two contexts accurately reflects the natural state of affairs, it is theoretically relevant to note that if these contexts were not so similar-due to nonrandom selection processes or to systematic interventions-then the content specificity of the BFLPE would probably be much more dramatic.",

One of these more specific components has been academic self-concept. The results presented here, however, suggest that general academic measures of self-concept should be replaced with math and English measures of self-concept. Because math and English self-concepts seem to be nearly uncorrelated, it may be unjustified to subsume these two measures into a more general measure of academic self-concept. 3 If the role of self-concept research in academic settings is to better predict academic behaviors and accomplishments, to provide outcome measures for academic interventions, and to relate academic self-3 One additional, unreported set of models was fitted to the entire set of 18 measured variables. These models were similar to models 2.1-2.4, except that each pair of math and English constructs was posited to represent a single global academic construct. Even after all the correlated uniquenesses considered previously were included, the fit of this model was very poor. Furthermore, the global academic self-concept variable tended to be a bipolar construct in which the math and English items loaded in the opposite direction. The inclusion of additional correlated uniquenesses among the math indicators of each construct and among the English indicators of each construct substantially improved the fit, but resulted in a seriously ill-defined model (the residual variance estimate for global academic self-concept was negative) and the global academic self-concept construct was nearly unrelated to global achievement. This pattern of results suggests than when variances attributable to the math self-concept indicators and to the English self-concept indicators are partialled out of the global academic self-concept construct through the inclusion of correlated uniquenesses, there is little or no variance left in the construct. This observation is consistent with the zero correlation between math and English self-concepts observed in earlier analyses. These models were not pursued, but the ill-defined results provide further support for the inappropriateness of a single global measure of academic self-concept. concept to other constructs, then math and English selfconcepts may be more useful than a general academic selfconcept. From this perspective, it is recommended that future research should examine math and English self-concept measures in relation to important theoretical issues in self-concept research.",

The findings are also important in that they demonstrate that math and English self-concepts are influenced by different processes than those that influence achievement. In this respect, there is empirical and theoretical support for earlier suggestions that academic self-concepts differ from corresponding academic achievements because the two constructs are evaluated in relation to different frames of reference. It is also possible that frame-ofreference effects that influence self-concepts will subsequently influence achievement-related behaviors (e.g., course selection and subsequent achievement) through their influence on academic self-concept (Marsh, 1987) .",

Marsh (1987; Marsh & Parker, 1984 ) posited this to be an example of frame-ofreference effects studied widely in social psychology and psychophysics and proposed a model based on this previous research. With regard to combining the BFLPE and the I/E models for purposes of the present investigation, it was proposed that if school-average contexts differ systematically in terms of math and English achievements, then these differences should be reflected in differential effects on math and English self-concepts. Whereas math and English contexts, as inferred from school-average tests scores, were highly correlated, they were sufficiently distinct to provide strong support for the predicted content specificity of the BFLPE. Support for this content specificity provides particularly compelling support for the theoretical bases for both the BFLPE and I/E models. The findings also demonstrate that self-concept responses are remarkably sensitive to even small differences in frame-of-reference contexts. On the basis of the nationally representative HSB sample, it appears that schools in which school-average achievements in mathematics and English differ substantially are rare. If, however, this natural state of affairs were artificially altered by the specific selection of students who were mathematically gifted without regard to their verbal abilities (or vice versa), then the effects demonstrated here would be predicted to be even larger, and these results would have important practical implications.",
