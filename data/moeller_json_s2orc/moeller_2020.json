The purpose of this article is to present the results of a meta-analysis of all studies that report empirical findings on social and dimensional comparisons concerning achievement and academic self-concept in two different subjects. In the theoretical section of this article, we discuss the I/E model (Marsh, 1986) , dimensional comparison theory (DCT; M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) , and the generalized I/E model (M\u00f6ller et al., 2016) . In the empirical section, we subsequently present a meta-analytic approach summarizing the empirical findings on the relations between achievement and self-concept. The meta-analysis answers the question of how various moderators, such as different subject combinations, achievement measure types, and participants' age, affect the relations between achievement and self-concept.",

Within an external frame of reference, students conduct social comparisons by comparing their accomplishments in a domain with their classmates' accomplishments in the same domain (e.g., \"How good am I in math compared to my classmates?\"). Within an internal frame of reference, they conduct dimensional comparisons (M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001a) by comparing their achievement in mathematics and L1 (e.g., \"How good am I in math compared with English?\"). Thus, academic self-concept in the two subjects is based on the information provided by these external and internal comparisons. For example, if a student's L1 achievement is higher than the average achievement of their classmates, their L1 self-concept will likely also be higher (social comparison). However, if their mathematics achievement is still higher than their L1 achievement, their L1 self-concept will likely be somewhat lower (dimensional comparison) .",

The strength of relations between L1 and mathematics achievement, as well as between achievement and corresponding self-concept, was moderated first by achievement measure type. Whereas the correlation between mathematics and L1 achievement was larger for standardized test scores than for teacher-assigned grades, the effect of achievement on self-concept was larger for grades, implying that grades are a more immediate source of achievement feedback for students when they are forming their selfconcept. Second, the type of self-concept measure moderated the relations: The coefficients of achievement on corresponding self-concept and the mathematics and L1 self-concept correlations were stronger when researchers used measures of self-efficacy, rather than ability self-concept. Subsequent to the meta-analysis of 2009, self-efficacy was no longer used in studies on the I/E model. Therefore, we did not apply self-concept measure as a moderator in our meta-analysis. Third, the correlation between self-concepts decreased with increasing age, thereby corroborating the assumption that general self-concept becomes more differentiated with age, as several self-concept dimensions emerge (see Marsh & Ayotte, 2003; Skaalvik & Valas, 1999) . The relation between achievement and noncorresponding self-concept did not change with growing age. However, there were only a few studies with elementary school children. Fourth, region of residence and fifth the percentage of girls/boys in the study samples did not affect the effect sizes. Sixth, sample size only affected the relations between achievements and between math achievement and verbal self-concept, with somewhat larger effects when samples were smaller. Finally, for publication year, correlations between mathematics and L1 achievement, and between self-concepts in the two domains, were larger in older studies than in more recent studies.",

However, a substantial body of research on I/E relations between different variables has been conducted since the publication of this meta-analysis. As a result, some limitations of the M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, et al.'s (2009) meta-analysis have become apparent, from the standpoint of subsequent research findings: The analysis dealt exclusively with self-evaluations of mathematics and L1 achievement (M\u00f6ller et al., 2016) . Since then, as proposed in the newly developed DCT (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) , researchers have examined an important extension: the extension to domains other than mathematics and L1. DCT suggests that the effects of dimensional comparisons are not limited to selfevaluations of mathematics and L1 achievement but can also be expected for other combinations of (academic) disciplines. This extension is the central part of the present meta-analysis. It enables us to answer the question of whether the relations described in the I/E model are also valid for subjects other than math and L1, in particular, for subjects more similar than math and L1-as discussed in the following section.",

Among the \"Big Three of comparative judgment\" (M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, , dimensional comparisons are of particular importance in the I/E model. DCT is based on empirical findings from introspective, path-analytic, and experimental studies on dimensional comparisons. It addresses the prevalence, the antecedents, and the consequences of dimensional comparisons. Additionally, it deals with the motivational basis for dimensional comparisons (suggesting a self-differentiation motivation; see , the integration of dimensional comparison processes into recent social cognitive approaches, and the interdependence of dimensional, social, and temporal comparisons. DCT's extension of the I/E model to domains other than math and L1 is most important for the present meta-analysis; this extension is part of the generalization of the I/E model. Whereas the classic I/E model is restricted to mathematics and L1 achievement and mathematics and L1 self-concept, DCT opens this logic up to a variety of other variables. Thus, recent research on DCT has yielded a generalized I/E model (GI/E model; M\u00f6ller et al., 2016) . According to this GI/E model, a person conducts dimensional comparisons when comparing his or her perceptions of aspects of a particular domain A with his or her perceptions of aspects of a particular domain B, and this has consequences for various self-perceptions related to these domains.",

These studies stimulated a further look at the impact of dimensional comparison, and the distinction between dimensional contrast and assimilation effects. Contrast effects occur when achievement in one subject has a negative impact on a noncorresponding self-concept, whereas assimilation effects occur when achievement in one subject has a positive impact on a noncorresponding selfconcept. Following DCT, dimensional comparison led to contrast effects in selfevaluations when the respective abilities are believed to be negatively correlated (Hypothesis VI of DCT; see M\u00f6ller et al., 2015) , and to assimilation effects in self-evaluations when the respective abilities are believed to be positively correlated (Hypothesis VII of DCT).",

Dimensional comparisons between subjects in which self-concepts are located relatively far from each other are called \"far comparisons.\" Comparisons between subjects in which each self-concept is relatively close to the other are called \"near comparisons.\" DCT assumes that far comparisons, such as those between mathematics and L1 achievement in the classic I/E model studies, lead to dimensional contrast effects. In contrast, near comparisons, such as those between L1 and L2 or mathematics and physics, are assumed to lead to weaker contrast effects or even to positive (assimilative) effects.",

Most of the effects of comparisons between two dissimilar subjects were clearly contrastive. Similarly, analyzing comparison effects across five academic domains, Jansen et al. (2015) showed negative coefficients of mathematics, physics, and chemistry achievement on German (L1) self-concept. Most of the relations between achievement and self-concept related to mathematics, physics, and chemistry were in turn (significantly or nonsignificantly) positive, implying small assimilation effects. In another recent study, Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al. (2015) demonstrated positive mean path coefficients for near comparisons and negative mean path coefficients for far comparisons. Marsh et al. (2014) revealed similar results, with small assimilation effects for two verbal subjects, Dutch as L1 and English as L2. Such results supported the central hypotheses of DCT: that far comparisons lead to strong contrast effects, but near comparisons lead to much weaker contrast or even assimilation effects. In contrast, some other studies have revealed contrasting relations between mathematics and science, although these are relatively similar subjects (Chiu, 2008 (Chiu, , 2012 . To date, the question as to which similar subjects produce small contrast effects and which produce assimilation effects remains open.",

Helm et al. (2016) experimentally induced a similarity or dissimilarity focus in students asked to compare pairs of school subjects such as mathematics and L1, mathematics and physics, and L1 and L2. They found stronger differences between students' self-concept measures in the subjects compared when students looked for dissimilarities between subjects than when they looked for similarities. Hence, perceived subject similarity-in in the form of beliefs about similarity in underlying abilities and in Helm et al. (2016) in the form of beliefs about similarities like difficulty, interestingness, or importance of the subject-seems to influence dimensional comparison outcomes. Yet, until now, there has been no meta-analytical overview of the dimensional comparison effects that emerge when subjects that are supposedly different, other than just mathematics and L1, are compared.",

In this regard, the GI/E model assumptions were demonstrated for subjective task value components (Arens et al., 2017; Gaspard et al., 2018; G\u00f6tz et al., 2008; , student-teacher relations , and interest (Schurtz et al., 2014) . These studies substantiated the existence of dimensional comparison effects of achievement in one domain on any kind of task value component in nonmatching standard domains. Although the comparison effects were weaker than in studies examining the effects on students' self-concept, it appeared to be the case that social and dimensional comparisons also influenced subjective task values (see Wigfield, Eccles, & M\u00f6ller, in press ). However, given the small number of studies investigating the relations of achievement and subjective task value components that are suggestive of social and dimensional comparisons, it would seem premature to analyze these relations meta-analytically. Therefore, in the present meta-analysis, we confined ourselves to examining the relations between achievement and selfconcept. In particular, we focused on the relations between dissimilar and similar subjects. As noted above, the most obvious restriction of the classic I/E model is its limitation to the two domains of mathematics and L1, thereby excluding the majority of other school subjects.",

With regard to its theoretical implications, the meta-analysis seeks to answer the question of whether dimensional comparisons always lead to contrast effects, or whether and under what conditions they lead to assimilation effects. To address this question, we analyzed the moderating role of the particular subject combinations and the (dis)similarity of the subjects; thus, the results of our study should allow a specification of DCT. Moreover, knowledge about whether dimensional comparisons lead to contrast or assimilation effects has important practical implications. For example, such knowledge allows teachers and parents to gain a better understanding of the development of students' self-concepts and thus to support students in the development of a positive self-concept.",

                "text": "The central approach of the present meta-analysis went far beyond that of the earlier meta-analysis by in at least four respects. First, it updated the 2009 meta-analysis by integrating all studies that researchers have carried out since then. Second, it overcame the restricted focus on mathematics and L1 by extending the I/E model to all subject combinations analyzed in the respective empirical research. Third, it systematically compared the relations proposed by DCT and the GI/E model for far and near comparisons. Fourth, with regard to those extensions considering the assumptions of DCT and the GI/E model, we evaluated whether potential moderators influence the relations between achievement and self-concept. Meta-analysts often differentiate between potential moderators worth considering for theoretical reasons (here, subject similarity and subject combination, types of achievement measure, years in school, and school type) and moderators that need to be explored for methodological reasons or for reasons of completeness (here, more subjects than mathematics and L1 being assessed in the study, gender distribution, region of residence, publication year, sample sizes, and author). In the following subsections, we elaborate on these moderators and derive hypotheses for the moderators considered worthy (for theoretical reasons) of being tested in the meta-analysis. In respect of the combination of subjects from the math/science and verbal domains, the central predictions of the present meta-analyses were derived from the classic I/E model: Hypothesis 1: High positive correlations between achievements in subjects from the math/science and verbal domains. Hypothesis 2: Moderate to zero correlations between self-concept measures in subjects from the math/science and verbal domains. Hypothesis 3: High positive path coefficients from achievement in math/science (verbal) domain to math/science (verbal) self-concept. Hypothesis 4: Moderate negative path coefficients from achievement in subjects in the math/science (verbal) domain to verbal (math/science) self-concept.",

For example, analyzing the subject combination mathematics/ physics might reveal different relations than analyzing the subject combination mathematics/biology, although both subject combinations belong to the math/science domain. Biology taught in school seems less similar to math than to physics (see Haag & G\u00f6tz, 2012) . However, as we found only a few studies dealing with these subject combinations, we conducted exploratory analyses rather than formulating specific predictions. Hansford and Hattie (1982) found that teacher-assigned grades are more positively correlated to self-concept than are standardized test results (see also Marsh, 1990a) . The earlier meta-analysis of the I/E model found similar results. More specifically, it revealed that the positive paths from achievement to self-concept within the domains were stronger when grades were used as the achievement indicators. In addition, it showed that correlations between mathematics and L1 achievement were substantially higher when these were based on test scores instead of grades. Cross-domain path coefficients were not moderated by achievement measure type in the former meta-analysis. However, more recently, Marsh et al. (2014) revealed moderating effects of achievement measures on the social and dimensional comparison effects in the I/E model. Therefore, we tested the moderating effect of type of achievement measure on the comparison effects in the I/E model once more, using a larger data set. We predicted the following:",

Reports on studies using the same samples as in a previous study were eliminated from all analyses, such as a German study by L\u00fcdtke et al. (2002) , using a subsample of national results from the PISA study. The literature search for the period up to the end of 2006 revealed the former 63 references used in and four new references, leading to 67 references in all in the period up to this time. We replicated the literature acquisition with studies published between 2007 and the end of April 2018. To update the search procedure, we used the electronic sources PsycINFO, PSYNDEXplus, Data Citation Index, MEDLINE, Wiley Online Library, PubMed PsycLIT, the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), and the Social Sciences Citation Index (search terms \"academic self-concept*\" OR \"self-concept* of abilit*\" OR \"abilit* self-concept * \") AND (\"achievement*\" OR \"grade*\" OR \"test*\" OR \"performance*\") OR (\"I E model\" OR \"dimensional comparison*\"). The total number of potentially relevant published and unpublished papers was 3,874. After screening on titles and abstracts of studies, we retrieved 386 references for full-text screening. We excluded all papers with studies that contained only the achievement-self-concept correlation in one subject. Additionally, we excluded all experimental studies (e.g., Strickhouser & Zell, 2015) , introspective studies (e.g., M\u00f6ller & Husemann, 2006) , and all studies asking participants to infer the self-concepts of fictitious students (e.g., M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, Jansen, et al., 2017) . Furthermore, data sets dealing with teachers', parents', or classmates' ratings of students' self-concepts (e.g., Dai, 2002) were excluded. Ultimately, 54 studies met the inclusion criteria.

To this end, we used the weighted average (weighted by sample size; Hunter & Schmidt, 2004) . As pointed out by O'Mara et al. (2006) , this procedure minimizes the dependence that is due to the fact that data stem from the same sample, but at the same time preserves as much of the information as possible (see also . Imagine a study in which multiple I/E models that differed with respect to the two school subjects to be compared (e.g., mathematics/English vs. physics/chemistry) were fitted to data stemming from the same sample. To prepare the data for estimation of the null model, we aggregated the correlation matrices underlying these different applications of the I/E model. However, when our aim was to conduct a moderator analysis to study the impact of subject similarity on the I/E model, we did not aggregate these correlation matrices but entered them separately into the meta-analysis. After the aggregation of correlation matrices according to the procedure described above, we estimated the parameters of the I/E model for each aggregated correlation matrix by fitting a path model to the correlation matrix, using OpenMx software (Boker et al., 2017) .",

We used one technique that allows for mitigation of this problem, suggested by Yuan and Chan (2008; see also Yuan & Chan, 2016) . This technique adds a small value a to the main diagonal of the nonpositive definite matrix R: R\u2032 = R + a \u00d7 I, where I is the identity matrix. We proceeded as follows: We first checked whether an aggregated correlation matrix was nonpositive definite. If this were the case (<5% of cases), we applied Yuan and Chan's (2008) technique to that correlation matrix and subjected the \"cured\" correlation matrix to OpenMx.

The random effects model (Equations 1 and 2) was used to pool the estimates of the parameters, taking into account the variability across data sets. As suggested by Overton (1998) , this model should be the preferred choice in meta-analysis. Note that the approach that we used in the present meta-analysis (i.e., pooling multiple path analyses; see Becker & Wu, 2007; Gasparrini et al., 2012) had several advantages over the alternative approach, of conducting the path analysis on the pooled correlation matrix. For example, it allowed for addressing the question of how the parameters (e.g., the path from achievement in one subject to self-concept in the other) of the I/E model varied across data sets. However, most important, it allowed us to investigate the influence of continuous moderators (e.g., gender distribution) on the parameters of the I/E model. The moderator analyses were conducted by estimating mixed-effects models for each of the moderators. In cases where a continuous moderator was investigated, we first standardized the moderator and then added it as a predictor to the second level of the model in Equation 2:",

First, we did not face the problem of conducting path analyses on incomplete correlation matrices, because in each study, all of the six correlations that formed the basis for estimating the I/E model were observed.

Table 2 also reveals that the average self-concept correlation was significantly different (\u0394r = .16) between both groups of studies: When two subjects from the verbal domain were included in the primary studies, the average self-concept correlation (r = .24) was significantly higher than for two dissimilar subjects. There was one significantly higher positive path coefficient from achievement to corresponding self-concept and, most important for DCT, two significantly less-negative path coefficients to the respective noncorresponding self-concept (all \u0394\u03b2 = .08). Hence, Hypothesis 6 found support: Within the verbal domain, the path coefficients on noncorresponding self-concept measures were less negative for near comparisons than for far comparisons. However, both cross-domain effects remained significantly negative, still indicating contrast effects of dimensional comparisons between two subjects from the verbal domain (\u03b2 = \u2212.09, \u03b2 = \u2212.11).",

Supplemental Table S4 (in the online version of the journal) shows the relations between mathematics and L1 achievement and self-concept in 18 data sets dealing with more than mathematics and L1, compared with the 106 data sets considering mathematics and L1 only. The intercept showed that the mean mathematics/L1 achievement correlation in studies without additional subjects was r = .58, whereas the mean mathematics/L1 self-concept correlation was r = .09. In the row below the intercept, a significant slope is presented as the difference between the intercept and the correlation when additional subjects are included (\u0394r = \u2212.17), resulting in a mean achievement correlation of r = .41 (last row of Supplemental Table S4 ). Therefore, the achievement correlation between mathematics and L1 was lower in studies dealing with additional subjects. Including the moderator increased the explained variance by R 2 = 9%. Supplemental Table S4 also reveals that the average self-concept correlation was not significantly different between both groups of studies, but when considering only those studies integrating more subjects than just mathematics and L1, the average self-concept correlation was no longer significant. Furthermore, Supplemental Table S4 shows significant differences for the path coefficients from achievement to corresponding self-concepts: These were higher for mathematics (\u0394\u03b2 = .09, \u03b2 = .64) and L1 (\u0394\u03b2 = .10, \u03b2 = .56) when students were asked about more subjects than just mathematics and L1. Thus, integrating additional subjects led to higher relations between achievement and corresponding self-concept with increased percentages of explained variance (math: R 2 = 5%, verbal: R 2 = 8%). There were no significant differences between the cross-path coefficients, which remained significantly negative.",

As we have shown, the relations described in the classic I/E model are not restricted to mathematics and L1 but are valid for a broad variety of subject combinations. Taken together, the central assumptions of the classic I/E model were supported for (almost) all analyzed subject combinations: First, the correlations between the achievements in all subjects were significantly positive. Second, they were remarkably stronger than the correlations between the respective self-concepts. Third, the path coefficients from achievements to corresponding self-concepts were substantial and positive for all subjects, indicating social comparison effects. Fourth, for most of the subject combinations, the path coefficients from achievements to noncorresponding self-concepts were significantly negative, indicating contrastive dimensional comparison effects.

For example, they are described as dealing with highly difficult connected topics that require a high degree of effort. In addition, verbal domain subjects, like English and German, are characterized as being very similar to each other: They are described, for example, as subjects with an emphasis on the exchange of views on topics that are up-to-date and relevant to daily life.

We know from psycholinguistic and education research that there are some commonalities between learning and working with languages. For example, Cummins and Swain (1986) define common underlying language proficiencies. From the students' point of view, these commonalities could promote a high perceived similarity of subjects dealing with languages. One explanation for our findings might be that, although both subjects deal with languages, L1 instruction in school seems to be quite different compared with learning L2 in school. Although there are so-called transfer effects between L1 and L2 (Gebauer et al., 2013) , there are on the other hand several differences between different language subjects. In the case of L1 classes, students use the language of instruction at a high proficiency level, whereas with L2 classes, students use the language of instruction at a low proficiency level. This difference in perceived competence levels in speaking the L1 and (different) foreign languages might cause a high perceived dissimilarity between the respective school subjects. Our results show that achieving very well (poorly) in L1 reduces (increases) foreign language selfconcept, and vice versa: This result may be interpreted as supporting the assumption of a high perceived dissimilarity. However, the contrast effects we found for comparisons between verbal subjects were lower than the contrast effects occurring between mathematics and L1. Thus, it can be assumed that students perceive L1 and L2 as rather dissimilar, but not as dissimilar as L1 and mathematics.",

Hence, it seems that students perceive math/science domain subjects as more similar to each other than they perceive verbal domain subjects to be. However, the effects were still negative, contradicting findings by M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, and K\u00f6ller (2006) , Jansen et al. (2015) , , who found similar small assimilation effects between achievements and academic self-concepts within the math/science domain (e.g., between mathematics and physics). On the other hand, Chiu (2008 Chiu ( , 2012 found contrast effects between mathematics and science. Since Chiu could not differentiate between subject-specific self-concepts in the single science subjects (physics, chemistry, and biology), the dimensional comparison effects may be the result of a mixture of different subjects being perceived as more or less similar. Additionally, when mathematics was compared with biology or physics achievement in our meta-analysis, different dimensional comparison effects emerged: Some of them were negative, some slightly positive. This is supportive of different similarity perceptions for the single-subject combinations. However, the assumption of DCT that dimensional comparisons between two subjects of the math/science domain lead to assimilation effects could not be supported by our analyses as a general rule.",

Whereas achievement correlations were similar for groups with similar and dissimilar subjects, self-concept correlations were significantly lower for the dissimilarity group, and the highest for two subjects of the math/science domain. These higher self-concept correlations between science subjects are accompanied by near-zero dimensional comparison effects between two subjects from the math/science domain. Two possible explanations can be advanced for these near-zero effects: First, students may not conduct dimensional comparisons at all between the two math/science subjects. Second, contrast and assimilation effects may both occur but be similar in size, thus canceling each other out, so that there is no substantial positive or negative net effect on noncorresponding self-concepts.

However, objective achievement tests seem to be less domain-specific than teacher-assigned grades, which tend to measure domain-specific ability and motivation components. Since students are much more familiar with their grades than with their results in objective test scores (which, in several studies, such as PISA [Programme for International Student Assessment], they do not even receive), it is not surprising that the grades prompt stronger social comparison effects than do test scores.

Conceivably, this finding may have resulted from the fact that mathematics and L1, as subjects at the end poles of the subject continuum, served as anchors and that the continuum is larger when more subjects in between are dealt with. More research is needed on students' conceptualizations of the subject continuum to further understand such relations. Since the mathematics/L1 achievement correlations were remarkably lower for studies with more subjects, another explanation could be that those studies including additional subjects often used grades rather than test scores as achievement indicators (see below).",

As proposed by the GI/E model, students draw on the performances of their classmates (social comparison) and on their own performances in similar and dissimilar school subjects (dimensional comparisons) as a basis for self-concept formation. According to our results, paths interpreted as social comparison effects are more prominent than paths interpreted as dimensional comparison effects. Within dimensional comparisons, contrast seems to be more prominent than assimilation. As expected, contrasts were strongest for dissimilar subjects. However, contrast was also apparent for comparisons between verbal domain subjects. For most subject combinations within the math/ science domain, neither assimilation nor contrast occurred. Hence, DCT is extended in respect of the following assumption: Comparisons between subjects from the same domain do not yield assimilative dimensional comparison effects-at least, if these are the only subjects considered in the I/E model.",
