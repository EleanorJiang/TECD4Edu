Essentially, while some people may share objective characteristics or accomplishments, differing standards of comparison or frames of reference can lead to disparate self-concepts among individuals (Van Zanden, . Educational research has focused on three types of comparison processes: 1) social, 2) temporal, and 3) dimensional. Festinger (1954) 's social comparison theory has been pivotal in highlighting the role of external frames of references in selfconceptions. Festinger's theory explains how self-concept can be influenced when people compare themselves against those around them. For instance, a student who performs well at school might develop low academic self-concept if they transfer to a high achieving school, despite their objectively excellent performance relative to the wider population. Albert (1977) 's work on temporal comparisons was also significant in highlighting the importance of comparison processes performed within a historical frame of reference, whereby individuals assess their current performance in the context of previous performances. For example, a student is likely to gain an increase in self-concept if they excel in an exam in a subject they had previously struggled in. Albert (1977) 's work on temporal comparisons was significant as it highlighted how frames of references beyond traditional social comparisons are critical to the way people self-evaluate.",

In overcoming this limitation, M\u20ac oller and Marsh (2013) focused on dimensional comparison processes as the core mechanism behind the formation of differentiated subject specific academic self-concepts. According to M\u20ac oller and Marsh, dimensional comparisons take place within an internal frame of reference, whereby people compare their own abilities in one area to another, resulting in ipsative relationships between domains. For example, a student may ask, \"How good am I in mathematics compared to English?\" Essentially, more positive evaluations in one domain will have a suppressing effect on evaluations in other domains, leading to a decreased self-concept in the domain judged as poorer by comparison. Importantly, this process can occur even when differences in objective achievement are reasonably small. Marsh (1986) argues that it is these dimensional comparisons that lead to the lack of correlation between mathematics and verbal self-concepts despite closely related mathematics and verbal achievement levels. These dimensional comparisons are the focus of the I/E model, which posits that internally based dimensional comparisons, in addition to external comparisons, are the core mechanisms behind the formation of differentiated subject specific academic self-concepts (M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) . Such a model has important practical implications, as differentiated self-concepts play a role in educational and career choices (Eccles, 1992) and may help to explain lower female uptake of degrees and careers in the physical sciences, mathematics, engineering, and technology (Parker, Nagy, Trautwein, & L\u00fcdtke, 2014) .",

In essence, Marsh demonstrated that individuals, who perform well in mathematics, also perform well in subjects emphasizing verbal skills (and vice versa), despite the fact that mathematics and verbal self-concepts are almost uncorrelated.

Of particular relevance is the correlation between the math and verbal components for each of the different constructs. Consistent with previous support for the I/E model, the correlation between math and verbal self-concept (r \u00bc 0.02, ns) is close to zero, whilst the correlation between math and verbal achievement is large in size (r \u00bc 0.62; p \u00bc <0.05). Consistent with Dai (2002) the correlation between parent perceptions of the math and verbal abilities of their students is also noteworthy (r \u00bc 0.46; p \u00bc <0.05); Dai also reported a correlation of 0.46. However, consistent with our premise that inferred selfconcepts are more appropriate for testing the generalizability of I/ E model to parent responses, the correlation between parent inferred math and verbal self-concepts (r \u00bc 0.14; p \u00bc <0.05) is modest. Indeed, the correlation between the two self-concepts inferred by parents is not significantly different than the correlations between the two self-concepts based on child ratings (Wald test \u00bc 1.82, p \u00bc 0.069), and both are significantly smaller than the correlation between the parent ratings of child abilities and child self-concept (Wald test \u00bc 6.77, p < 0.001) and parent ratings of child abilities and parent inferred self-concept (Wald test \u00bc 7.01, p < 0.001).

Like Dai, we showed that parent perceptions of the child's abilities followed a similar pattern to achievement measures as opposed to student self-concepts or inferred selfconcepts. However, when using inferred self-concept ratings by parents there was support for the generalizability of the I/E model. This study demonstrated that previous reviews of self-concept research misinterpreted Dai's original study by inaccurately describing the results in terms of inferred parent self-concepts. Juxtaposing all three constructs in the same study has provided a strong basis for new conclusions of the generalizability of the I/E model. Now that this support is demonstrated, there is a need to extend these findings to inferred self-concept ratings by other significant others, in relation to other domains of self-concept, and to responses by younger children for which self-other agreement is typically weaker.",
