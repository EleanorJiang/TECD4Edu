Random ordering of items or maximizing the distance by cycling the items of a scale (i.e., putting exactly one item of each scale between two items of each other scale) is chosen to reduce the impact of possible response biases, making the measurement purpose less transparent to the respondents. Moreover, a more varied and less monotonous item order might help to maintain the respondents' attention and motivation while filling out a questionnaire (e.g., Schriesheim, Kopelman, & Solomon, 1989; Solomon & Kopelman, 1984) . These arguments in favor of random ordering or maximizing the distance between the items of one scale may not apply uniformly to all assessment settings, however. In anonymous assessment situations-the usual case in educational and psychological research-there is less need to present oneself favorably or in a socially desirable manner. Schriesheim and DeNisi (1980) have suggested some advantages of a blocked item arrangement, with all items measuring one construct being grouped together. For example, this mode of presentation might be taken by the respondents to signify that the presentation of similar (but not identical) items is not a trick on behalf of the experimenter. This might lead to increased levels of trust and openness of the respondents and thus raise their motivation to give valid responses.",

According to them, the presentation context of an item influences the interpretation of an item as well as the retrieval of item-relevant information from memory, the use of this information to come to a final judgment, and the process of reporting the answer. Furthermore, other studies have shown a significant relation between the item order and the mean, the variance, and the reliability of a target item (e.g., Knowles, 1988; Knowles & Byers, 1996; Steinberg, 1994) . As such, the correlation of one item with the remaining items of the corresponding scale seems to be higher if the item is placed in a later position within a scale of corresponding items.

                "text": "From a practical perspective, the most important question seems to be whether the item arrangement (i.e., blocked or random) has a decisive impact on the psychometric properties of an entire scale and not only on a specific item. Although possible effects have been widely discussed in the literature on test construction, results of empirical studies have always been quite inconsistent. Some authors of early studies revealed almost identical attitude profiles (Baehr, 1953) and psychometric characteristics (Lyman, 1949) of two versions of their questionnaires, one with items arranged in a randomized order and one with the items arranged in a blocked format. Analyzing these two modes, Schriesheim et al. (1989) found in three studies with different samples that \"neither format is clearly superior to the other on any of the examined psychometric properties\" (p. 487). On the other hand, Schriesheim and DeNisi (1980) reported superior convergent and discriminant validity coefficients for a randomized compared with a blocked version. Recently, Alterman et al. (2003) analyzed whether a blocked subscale (i.e., the Socialization subscale of the California Psychological Inventory; Gough & Bradley, 1996) showed different psychometric properties and different convergent validity coefficients in comparison with the original randomized version. Unfortunately, in this study, all participants answered the blocked version on 1 day and the other version a few days later. Therefore, no separation of retest effects and potential blocking effects was possible. Consequently, any interpretation concerning the small mean differences (d = 0.15, with lower values of the embedded version at the second measurement point), the lower homogeneity of the embedded version (\u03b1 = .68 vs. \u03b1 = .77), and the differences in the convergent correlation coefficients seems to be equivocal. Based on the item response theory, Ortner (2004) administered the items of seven shortened scales of the Eysenck Personality Profiler (Eysenck, 1995) to one group in the regular order and to another group in an inversed order. Ortner found no statistically significant mean difference of the test scores. Using graphical model checks, item difficulties seemed to be different in three of the seven considered scales. However, the fact that in this study participants were not assigned randomly to the two groups limits the interpretation of these results.",

Some effects were observed on the level of scale means, scale variances, scale reliabilities, and scale intercorrelations, but most differences could not be replicated using identical operationalizations and similar samples. Some effects later even turned in the opposite direction. Rost and Hoberg (1997) also analyzed potential blocking effects in two independent samples (blocked vs. random order). They used four academic self-concept scales (i.e., General Academic Ability, Math, German, Geography). The differences between the means of the two different versions were practically irrelevant for the General Academic Ability (d = 0.11) and Math self-concept scales (d = 0.06). Slightly higher means of the blocked versions were observed for the German (d = -0.23) and Geography self-concept scales (d = -0.33). No statistically significant differences emerged in terms of scale variances and intercorrelations. The homogeneities of all scales as well as the factorial structure of the self-concept facets were very similar in both groups (i.e., factor congruence coefficients always exceeded r cc = .96).",

Depending on the presentation context, they reported a substantial shift in the meaning of global self-esteem items in single-group confirmatory factor analyses. As such, the responses to items measuring global self-esteem had higher correlations with a specific self-concept domain if these items were embedded among items tapping this specific self-concept domain than if they were embedded among other items.

Further testing of item-blocking effects should, therefore, use a well-defined psychological construct, such as academic self-concept. Academic self-concept is a well-established, multifaceted construct, which can be measured reliably (e.g., Byrne, 1996) . Also, the relationship of different academic self-concepts with achievement indicators is well known, supporting the validity of this construct. Typically, grades and corresponding self-concepts correlate between r = .40 and r = .80 (e.g., Marsh, 1986) . The prominent internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model (Marsh, 1986) postulates two comparison processes between different academic self-concept facets. Using the external frame of reference, students compare their achievements in one subject with those of their classmates. More relevant to the question of context effects is the dimensional comparison process, that is, the internal frame of reference. Here, students compare their achievements in one subject with their achievements in another subject. Commonly, a path-analytical approach is taken to test the I/E model. Positive paths from achievement scores to the corresponding self-concept scores are interpreted as support for the external (social) process, whereas negative path coefficients from achievement scores to noncorresponding self-concepts (contrast effects) are interpreted as support of the internal frame of reference. The I/E model has been investigated by many studies worldwide, and the effects have turned out to be very stable across different countries and operationalizations (M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2004) .",

Eight items with an empty space ( . . .) left for the individual school subject were presented within a grid, containing eight rows for the items and four columns for the four subjects. The students were expected to fill out the left space ( . . .) mentally with the corresponding subject. Therefore, the wording of the items for the four subjects was identical and as follows: \"I am first to know the answer to questions in (. . .),\" \"sometimes I feel superior to my classmates in (. . .) courses and think they might learn something from me,\" \"I can figure out things for myself in (. . .),\" \"I am satisfied with my debating ability in (. . .) classes,\" \"I solve problems in (. . .) quite easily,\" \"good grades come easily to me in (. . .),\" \"I am a good student in (. . .),\" and \"I feel good about my course work in(. . . .).\" Students responded to each item on a 6-point scale ranging from not at all true (1) to perfectly true (6). The postulated four-dimensional structure of the DISC Grid has been replicated in exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (Rost, Sparfeldt, & Schilling, 2006) . As such, the subject-specific selfconcept scores measured with the DISC Grid were highly reliable (\u03b1 > .90) and displayed good convergent discriminant validity coefficients with grades in various samples. Self-concept in math and self-concept in German measured with the DISC Grid correlated substantially with a German adaptation of the well-established and frequently used Self-Description Questionnaire (Marsh, 1990) , specifically with the self-concepts in math and German: r = .87 and r = .77, respectively (Schilling et al., 2005) . It should be mentioned, however, that the items of the Self-Description Questionnaire are not ordered in a blocked manner. The self-concepts of the CG were mea-sured with identical items, but the items were presented in the usual questionnaire format. That is, each item specified the respective subject, and all items were arranged randomly (with the exception that not more than two items of one self-concept facet followed each other).",

The factor loadings from this analysis-conducted within the two formats separately (Table 1)-were very similar for the grid and the nongrid versions of the questionnaire. The next step was to examine models with different constraints. The model with factor loadings constrained to be identical in both groups still showed an acceptable fit (TLI = .944; RMSEA = .043 ). This model did not have a statistically significantly worse fit than that of the baseline model (\u2206\u03c7 2 = 38.6, \u2206df = 28, p = .09), providing strong support for the minimal condition of factorial invariance. Furthermore, the factor covariances were restricted to be identical in both groups. Again, the fit of this model was not statistically different from that of the baseline model (TLI = .944; RMSEA = .043 [CI = .041-.046]; \u2206\u03c7 2 = 46.6, \u2206df = 34, p = .07).

If the grid arrangement influenced the dimensional (internal) comparison processes relevant for self-concept formation systematically and consistently, significant changes of factor loadings, factor correlations, and the path coefficients of the I/E model should have arisen. In confirmatory multiple group analyses, no such differences emerged in the current study. It is important to note that the identified scale means, standard deviations, and homogeneities were similar. Adhering to Cohen's (1988) classification of effect sizes, even the largest scale mean difference (self-concept English) was negligible. Analyzing item differences, we observed only three statistically significant differences. Therefore, neither of the two extreme presentation forms was superior with regard to any of the examined psychometric properties, at least on a scale level, corroborating conclusions drawn by Schriesheim et al.

Especially the theoretical elaboration, the adaptation of adequate measurement instruments and the existence of established models like the I/E model (Marsh, 1986 ) make academic self-concept appear as a concept superior to many other psychological concepts investigating potential effects of item-context effects. In addition, there are empirical results pointing out that measures of the self are sensitive to item-context effects (Marsh & Yeung, 1999) .
