Moreover, learning activities that are influenced by a person's interest have a higher probability of resulting in deeplevel learning processes than learning activities with no relationship to a person's interests (Krapp, 2002b) . However, a common finding indicates that students' academic interests decline during the school course (e.g., Dotterer, McHale, & Crouter, 2009) . Therefore, it is important to know which variables influence the development of students' academic interests. Theoretical as well as empirical research emphasized that students' own competences are important predictors of their interests. To evaluate their ability within one domain, persons not only refer to their own domainspecific achievements, but they also compare their individual achievements with others as well as with their own achievements in other domains (c.f. Marsh, 1986; M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) . There are only a few studies which have analyzed these various ways in which students' interests are affected by their competences and the degree to which students' grades and self-concepts play a role in that relation. To identify these various influences, the present paper analyzes the impact of students' competences, grades and selfconcepts on their subject-interests in mathematics and English (as a first foreign language in school (FL)), at the beginning of secondary school.",

                "text": "To conceptualize students' interest, we refer to the Person-Object-Conception of Interest by Krapp (2002a) . According to this theoretical framework, an interest represents a particular relationship between a person and an object of interest. The person's relationship to an object of interest is characterized by emotionaland value-related aspects: The interest-related actions and contents have a subjective significance for the person, and he or she likes to spend time on them. Because of the high personal value of an interest, a person's interests are a central part of his or her identity (Krapp, 2000 (Krapp, , 2002a . Based on the theoretical assumption that a person likes being engaged in interest-related activities, it is supposed that persons develop an interest especially in topics for which they regard themselves as being competent. Analyzing the impact of students' competences on their interests within a domain, research findings indicated a positive impact of students' competences on their interests (e.g., Baumert, Schnabel, & Lehrke, 1998; Deci & Ryan, 2000; La Guardia & Ryan, 2002) , which is likely to be mediated by students' evaluation of their domainspecific abilities, i.e. self-concepts (e.g., Baumert et al., 1998; Denissen, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2007; . Moreover, interests can be categorized into situational and individual interests. Situational interests represent current engagements being created by a particular situation, whereas individual interests comprise a person's dispositional structure. Before developing a stable individual interest, persons experience a situational interest which depends on the degree of interest of a particular situation. If a current engagement in a particular situation persists, persons will likely develop an interest as a dispositional structure (Hidi & Renninger, 2006; Krapp, 2002b; Schiefele, 2009) . The concept of students' subject-interests to which this paper refers comprises not only students' interests in terms of the topic of the school subject but rather in terms of the '( \u2026 ) whole arrangement of teaching, learning and acting in the field of a certain school subject' (Krapp, 2002b , pp. 387, referring to Hoffmann, 2002 . Thus, students' interests in mathematics and English (FL) represent a combination of individual interests in the topic of the school subject and the interestingness of situational aspects that are related to the particular instructions of these topics (Hoffmann, 2002) .",

                "text": "A common finding of studies that analyze the development of students' academic interests is that students enter the school system with comparatively high academic interests. However, on average, these interests decline during the school course (e.g., Dotterer et al., 2009; Hidi, 2000; Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, & Wigfield, 2002) . A possible explanation for this finding is the process of interest differentiation. According to this thesis, young children show a universal interest for nearly all things, whereas adolescent students start to develop interests in particular domains (c.f. Daniels, 2008; Todt & Schreiber, 1998) . The interest for other, non-matching domains, however, should decrease, since the perpetuation of a particular interest requires an ongoing engagement with the interest-related activities. It is assumed that dimensional achievement comparisons are the underlying mechanisms for the process of self-differentiation (Daniels, 2008) . Accordingly, students compare their individual achievement within a particular domain with their own achievement in other domains. These dimensional comparisons were mainly researched within the internal/external frame of reference model (I/E-model, Marsh, 1986 ) that focusses on the formation of students' self-concepts. Research findings indicated that although students' academic achievement within a particular domain (school grades or competence measures) positively affects their corresponding self-concepts, it negatively affects students' self-concepts in other, non-matching domains (M\u20ac oller, Pohlmann, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2009; M\u20ac oller, Retelsdorf, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2011) . Since dimensional comparisons serve as a source of information about students' abilities and weaknesses, they should help students to recognize domains in which they can specialize, and for which they could develop particular preferences and interests (Chiu, 2012; M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013; M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) . Based on these assumptions, K\u20ac oller et al. (April 2000) examined the influence of dimensional comparisons on students' subject-interests in mathematics and English (FL), taking students' grades and self-concepts into account. Analyzing German students attending higher academic track schools from grade 10 to grade 12, the results indicated that students' grades impacted on their subject-interests following the typical I/E-model pattern. However, the negative effects of students' grades on their subject-interests in the respective other domain were totally mediated by students' self-concepts. Similarly, Pohlmann (2005) found a mediation effect of dimensional comparisons on student subject-interest via student self-concept when analyzing German students from grade 7 to grade 10. However, these studies only focus on internal, dimensional comparisons and their impact on students' subject-interests. Beyond dimensional comparisons, the theoretical assumptions of the I/E-Model comprise social comparisons with a student's reference group. Accordingly, students evaluate their abilities within a particular domain by not only referring to their own achievement within several domains but also by referring to the achievement level of others. The impact of social comparisons with students' scholastic reference group on their self-concept was mainly researched within the big-fish-little-pond-effect model (BFLPE; Marsh et al., 2008) . The main research finding indicates that students within high achieving schools or classes develop a lower self-concept compared to equally achieving students who compare their individual achievement with a low achieving reference group (e.g., Dijkstra, Kuyper, van der Werf, Buunk, & van der Zee, 2008; Marsh & Hau, 2003; Nagengast & Marsh, 2012) . With regard to students' subject-interests, it can be assumed that high achieving classes indicate to an average achieving student that he or she is not as competent as the others within that particular domain. Such a context is expected to decrease the chance that an average achieving student will show an interest within that domain (c.f. Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, Marsh, K\u20ac oller, & Baumert, 2006) . Previous research has been conducted with regard to the mathematical subject-interest, focusing on students in both late junior and senior years. Corresponding studies emphasized a negative impact of average school achievement on student subjectinterest in mathematics, which is mediated by their mathematical self-concept (K\u20ac oller, 2004; Trautwein et al., 2006) . Moreover, a cross-sectional study by Trautwein et al. (2006) showed a partial mediation of the impact of class achievement on students' subject-interests via students' grades and self-concepts. These findings are in line with previous studies showing that students' grades seem to be the more salient achievement indicator than students' competences (e.g., M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) .",

Although the original theoretical approach includes the effects of social comparisons with students' reference group as external comparisons, empirical studies analyzing the I/E-Model generally do not account for the impact of aggregated school or class achievement on students' self-concepts (Chiu, 2012) . Thus, to analyze the impact of internal, dimensional as well as external, social comparisons with students' scholastic reference group, recent studies analyzed the impact of both achievement comparisons on students' self-concepts simultaneously. In the crosssectional study of Chiu (2012) , the combined model was tested for eighth Graders' self-concepts in mathematics and science using data from the TIMSS 2003 study. Parker, Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, and Trautwein (2013) analyzed students' self-concepts in mathematics and English (FL) in German upper secondary school. The findings of both studies indicated that social and dimensional comparisons influence students' self-concepts independently of each other. Thus, both achievement comparisons seem to serve different sets of information upon which students can form their self-concepts.",

First, at this stage of their education, German students changed their scholastic reference group for the first time since the beginning of formal education. At the end of grade 4, German students in most federal states move from primary to secondary school. Thus, at the beginning of secondary school, students are grouped into new classes. This new setting should stimulate social comparisons (Hattie, 1992) . Second, the students' peer group becomes more important during adolescence. Accordingly, social comparisons with the other class members should increase in its importance regarding students' subject-interests (c.f. Hattie, 1992) . Third, it is assumed that the process of interest differentiation takes place especially during adolescence (Daniels, 2008) .

Thereby, we assume that students' grades mediate the effect of students' competences on their subjectinterests, since grades represent more salient information about students' school achievements (e.g., Trautwein et al., 2006) . Moreover, prior findings indicated that the impact of social as well as dimensional comparisons on students' subject-interests is mediated by their subject-specific self-concepts (e.g., K\u20ac oller et al., April 2000; Trautwein et al., 2006) . Accordingly, we analyze students' self-concepts as a second mediator, leading to the following concluding model: students' competences are assumed to directly influence their grades, which in turn should have a direct impact on students' self-concepts. Students' self-concepts, in turn, should have a direct influence on students' subject-interests (Hypothesis 3). Thus, students' grades are assumed to affect their self-concept following the typical pattern of dimensional comparisons. However, students' subject-interests are assumed to be impacted by student's corresponding self-concepts only. Similarly, the negative influence of aggregated class achievement on students' subjectinterests should be completely mediated via students' corresponding self-concepts. 4) Do students' grades and self-concepts in mathematics and English mediate the impact of students' competences on the development of students' mathematical and English subjectinterests from grade 5 to grade 6?",

BiKS is a DFG-founded interdisciplinary research project that runs two longitudinal studies on educational processes, competence development and selection decisions in preschool-and school age children. The secondary school sample of the BiKS-8-14 longitudinal study consisted of N \u00bc 1799 students (47.8% males) in grade 5 who took part in both a questionnaire and competence assessment. Schools were selected from the southern and middle part of Germany. In grade 6, 96.0% (N \u00bc 1727) of the students were reassessed. Students' parents had to give active informed consent, which led to a slight overrepresentation in the sample in terms of students with better grades and without an immigration background. The subsample used in the present study consisted of students who did not leave the study before grade 6. We excluded all students whose first foreign language was not English (N \u00bc 199) . We also excluded classes containing the data of 4 or fewer students (N \u00bc 131) as this is the minimal number of students needed to compute a conclusive class achievement (c.f. Marsh & Hau, 2003) . Finally, we excluded students with missing values on all variables of the models (N \u00bc 7) because these cases also lacked many values on the auxiliary variables of the imputation model. As a result, the data of N \u00bc 1390 students (48.6% males) remained from the secondary school sample and were then used for the following analyses. Students were nested in 106 classes with an average of 13.1 students per class. In grade 5, the students' average age was 11.5 years (SD \u00bc .5) and 14.2% (N \u00bc 175) of the students lived in households with migration backgrounds. Furthermore, 56.7% (N \u00bc 788) of the students attended higher academic track schools (Gymnasium), 20.1% (N \u00bc 279) attended middle track schools (Realschule) and 23.2% (N \u00bc 323) attended lower academic track schools (Hauptschule).",

The concept of this test was developed by Metze (2003) to concisely indicate reading skills of primary school students. The test was adapted to foreign languages such as English by a group of researchers of the University Siegen as well as the German study 'KESS 7' (Bos, Bonsen, Gr\u20ac ohlich, Guill, & Scharenberg, 2009) . The stumbling-words reading test consisted of 35 short sentences, each of which included one extraneous word. This stumbling-word disrupted the grammatical correctness of the sentence, and students had to correct the sentences by crossing out the stumblingwords. One example is the item: 'I'm a name good reader.' In this instance, 'name' represents the stumbling-word and has to be crossed out (c.f. Neuenhaus, 2011 for the full test). This requires students to correctly read and understand the words. Moreover, it calls on the ability to understand the meaning of the sentences by comparatively processing both the words and the grammatical structure of the sentences (Metze, 2003) . With a forced 4 min time limit, the test had a strong speed component. The score was generated by computing the sum of correctly solved items. Due to the fact that this measure is a speed-test, Cronbach's Alpha as well as characteristics of the item analyses cannot be interpreted meaningfully and are therefore not provided. The used competence test was adequate to differ between students of lower/middle and higher academic track schools. Accordingly, students' of lower/ middle academic track schools (M \u00bc 14.74; SD \u00bc 6.87; Min \u00bc 0; Max \u00bc 35) scored lower on average than students of higher academic track schools (M \u00bc 23.81; SD \u00bc 6.47; Min \u00bc 1; Max \u00bc 35).

The percentage of missing data in the variables used varied between 6.5% (both mathematical and English competence) and 12.4% (subject-interest in both mathematics and English). To handle the missing data, missing values were multiple imputed by computing 5 datasets using SPSS 19. The imputation model consisted of a wide range of background variables, such as students' age, sex, socioeconomic and migration background, as well as information about the measures used, from both the previous and subsequent assessment wave. In order to present standardized effects, the average scores of all relevant variables within each imputed dataset were set to zero and their variances were set to one. The impact of class achievement on the outcome variables has been estimated using the reflective aggregation procedure of Mplus (Muth en & Muth en, 1998e2010). Therefore, the impact of achievement on the outcome variable was modeled on Level 1 (b L1 ) and Level 2 (b L2 ).

No other direct effects were estimated.

After removing the corresponding constraints and setting insignificant parameters to zero, the model fit the data (Chi 2 \u00bc 19.619, df \u00bc 11, p > .05; RMSEA \u00bc .024; CFI \u00bc .998). As Fig. 4 illustrates, students' self-concepts were affected by their grades following the typical pattern of dimensional comparisons: high grades in English had a positive impact on students' self-concepts in English, but a negative impact on their self-concepts in mathematics (b \u00bc \u00c0.156, p < .05).

                "text": "This paper aimed to analyze the impact of social and dimensional comparisons on students' subject-interests in mathematics and English (FL) at the beginning of secondary school. The first research question intended to show the direct effect of students' competences on their subject-interests in mathematics and English considering the effects of the I/E-Model and the BFLPE separately. Our findings showed the typical patterns of social and dimensional comparisons and, thus, confirmed Hypothesis 1a and 1b. Beyond previous studies, our findings showed that class achievement negatively impacts on students' subject-interests not only in mathematics but also in English (FL). However, compared to students' mathematical subject-interests, the standardized effects also indicated a lower importance of the scholastic reference group for students' subject-interests in English. A possible explanation could be that mathematical competences are primarily learned and experienced by students within the school context. Although students' English competences are also primarily taught in school, English is more present during students' extracurricular time, i.e. concerning the world-wide-web, English commercials or songs. Accordingly, experiences outside the school context are likely to be more important for students' subject-interests in English than in mathematics, which might lead to a reduced importance of the scholastic reference group. With regard to the second research question, both achievement comparisons and their impact on students' subject-interests were modeled simultaneously. Supporting Hypothesis 2, the effects remained stable when analyzing social and dimensional achievement comparisons simultaneously. Only the negative effect of mathematical competence on subject-interest in English was no longer significant. Concerning the third research question, our results emphasized a mediation of the effects of both achievement comparisons by students' grades and self-concepts. For both domains, an indirect effect of class achievement could be observed, indicating that class achievement influenced students' individual grades, which in turn impacted on their self-concepts and subject-interests (Hypothesis 3). However, contrary to our third hypothesis, aggregated achievement maintained a direct negative influence on students' mathematical subject-interests after considering the influence of students' self-concepts into account. It is possible that the direct effect of social comparisons on students' subject-interests in mathematics is only observable at the beginning of secondary school, when students are grouped within a new class context. The new reference group could lead to very strong and, therefore, direct effects of social comparisons on students' subject-interests. Moreover, the direct effect from students' mathematical competences on their subject-interests in English remained observable. This could be a methodological artifact that occurred because of the partly unreliable measurement of our constructs. Finally, within the fourth research question, the last model was analyzed with regard to the development of students' subject-interests. Confirming the respective hypothesis, findings showed that the presented pattern of effects could also be found when looking at the development of students' subject-interests in mathematics and English (FL) from grade 5 to grade 6.",

First, students' individual achievements have a direct impact on their subject-interests in one domain; second, there are unique effects of class achievement on students' subject-interests within this domain; third, students' subject-interests are additionally affected by their individual achievements within another non-matching domain. Moreover, confirming previous studies, our findings showed that student grades and self-concepts are important mediators. Thereby, students mainly use their grades to perform achievement comparisons (c.f. M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) . Those achievement comparisons, in turn, primarily impact students' selfconcepts. Thus, students' subject-interests are mostly impacted by their domain-specific self-concepts. In accordance with prior findings (e.g., Trautwein et al., 2006) , our results showed that student grades are negatively dependent on the average class achievement in the corresponding domain. Furthermore, school grades are used by students for self-differentiation processes regarding dimensional comparisons. Since teachers assign grades in the context of the entire class, these dimensional comparisons are partially moderated by the average achievement of the class. Thus, our findings not only indicate unique effects of both achievement comparisons on students' subject-interests but also emphasize that they are related to each other. However, it should be mentioned that student achievement is not only an important predictor of the development of students' subject-interests. Referring to the Person-Object Conception of Interests, interested persons tend to enlarge their knowledge about the object of interest and improve related competences (Krapp, 2000 (Krapp, , 2002b . Thus, it is assumed and was shown empirically that students' achievement is also an important outcome of an individual interest (e.g. Denissen et al., 2007; .",

Since German students are grouped within different school tracks according to their school performance after four years of primary education, students with a high school performance are more likely to attend higher academic track schools, whereas lower performing students are more likely to attend middle or lower academic track schools. Accordingly, the observed impact of the achievement level of the classes could be traced back to the initial sorting into the various school tracks. However, we were not able to take the school track into account due to the fact that a corresponding multi-group comparison model did not converge with the data. As an explanation, we assume that the number of parameters in the last model is too high compared to the low number of middle and lower academic track schools participating in our study.",

Social comparisons, however, seem to have a differential impact within these domains. Analyzing social and dimensional comparisons as well as both mediators in a single model allowed us to depict the various ways in which the development of students' subjectinterests in mathematics and English (FL) are affected by their competences, grades and self-concepts. Due to the fact that the effects of social and dimensional comparisons seem to be independent of each other, our results support the assumption that both achievement comparisons serve as different sources of information for students to evaluate their competence. Accordingly, social comparisons with the scholastic reference group can be expected to be mainly based on the notion of realistic self-evaluation, whereas dimensional comparisons seem to be based on self-differentiation and identity developmental processes (c.f. Chiu, 2012; M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) . Since both achievement comparisons have a negative impact on students' subject-specific self-concepts and, thus, corresponding subject-interests, students' social and dimensional achievement comparisons seem to serve as a possible explanation for the common finding of declining academic interests during the school course. In order to understand whether the importance of achievement comparisons, as well as the mediation by students' self-concepts, changes across school years, future research should analyze students' differential interest development from early to late stages of secondary school. Concerning the practical implications of our study, our findings underline the importance of supporting students' self-concepts to increase their interests for the school-subjects mathematics and English (FL). Moreover, the instructional practice of the teacher is an important influential factor, since our conception of students' subject-interests comprises individual as well as situational aspects. According to the Person-Object Conception of Interest, instructional practices which support students' need of competence experience, autonomy and social integration can be expected to create an instructional context in which the development of students' subject-interests is well supported. In conclusion, students' academic achievement comparisons are complex and multifaceted. The analysis of students' achievement comparisons seems to be a good approach to capture the various ways how students' competences impact on their subject-interests.",
