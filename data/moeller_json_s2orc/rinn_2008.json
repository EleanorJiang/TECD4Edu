First, achievement in one area should have a direct positive effect on self-concept in the related area (due to the external comparisons) and a negative effect on self-concept in the other area (due to the internal comparisons). For example, a student's verbal achievement would have a positive impact on his or her verbal self-concept and a negative impact on his or her math self-concept. The competing effects of the external and internal comparisons largely cancel each other out and a student's math self-concept may appear to be unrelated to his or her verbal self-concept, although he or she may have very similar mathematics and verbal achievement (Plucker & Stocking, 2001 ).

They found a significant correlation between prior achievement in one area and self-concept in the same domain. These data indicated students compare their own ability or competence to other students' abilities in order to create their individual self-con-cept. Further, the I/E model has been replicated in a sports-related context (Tietjens & Niewerth, 2005) , using more than two subject areas (Schilling, Sparfeldt, & Rost, 2004) , and using achievement in German rather than in English (Dickh\u00e4user, 2005) .

The students used internal and external comparisons to assist in the process of determining their verbal and math self-concepts. Plucker and Stocking (2001) used the I/E model to study academically talented students who participated in a summer program, and they, too, found support for the I/E model. They found a significant, positive correlation between math achievement and math self-concept, and between verbal achievement and verbal self-concept. Additionally, there was a significant negative correlation between math achievement and verbal self-concept and between verbal achievement and math self-concept. The I/E model has been replicated with gifted students from other cultures as well. For example, Mui, Yeung, Low, and Jin (2000) found support for the I/E model with a sample of gifted Chinese adolescents. Marsh's (1986) original notion about the I/E model's generalizability is that it likely equally applies to males and females. However, researchers have found mixed results with regard to the applicability of the I/E model to explain the self-concept development of males and females. For example, Skaalvik and Rankin (1990) examined the math and verbal self-concepts of 231 Norwegian sixth-grade students. Math/verbal self-concepts were measured by means of the student's expected success on a particular mathematics or verbal task. Math/verbal achievement was measured by the student's performance on these specific math and verbal tasks. 1 Skaalvik and Rankin (1990) found no significant differences between boys and girls in math achievement or math self-concept, but they did find a significant difference between boys and girls in verbal achievement and verbal self-concept such that girls had a higher verbal self-concept and higher verbal achievement than boys. In addition, Skaalvik and Rankin (1990) found a correlation of 0.63 between math and verbal achievement, which concurred with previous findings. However, verbal and math self-concept was correlated at 0.67, which did not support previous findings regarding the I/E model (Marsh, 1986; Marsh et al., 1988) . Further, for girls, verbal achievement negatively affected math self-concept. Skaalvik and Rankin (1995) conducted another study whereby they examined sixth-and ninth-grade Norwegian students. Results involving general math and verbal self-perceptions supported Marsh's I/E model. However, it is important to add that Rankin's (1990, 1995) participants were not gifted in either study, which means their findings cannot be generalized to the gifted population. In a nationally representative sample consisting of more than 20,000 participants, Marsh and Yeung (1998) found girls scored higher on verbal achievement, verbal self-concept, and math achievement, but they had lower math self-concept scores than boys. However, Marsh and Yeung did not find gender differences with regard to the I/E model, such that prior verbal and math constructs affected subsequent verbal and math outcomes in a similar manner for girls and boys. Swiatek's (2005) research examined 2,283 third-through sixthgrade talent search participants. The students were asked to answer questions indicating how capable they felt in an academic area compared to their classmates. Swiatek found no differences between males and females with regard to academic self-concept or academic achievement. As self-concept likely becomes more differentiated with age (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) , these findings are not surprising.",

In other words, one's self-concept likely affects his or her career choice. Many researchers have supported this notion (e.g., Farmer, 1985; Gottfredson, 2002; Holland, 1973; Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 1994 Rottinghaus, Lindley, Green, & Borgen, 2002) . For example, Marsh and O'Neill (1984) found females' aspirations to attend college or university were moderately correlated with general academic self-concept (r = 0.31, p < 0.01). Further, self-concept affects course selection, which affects a student's aspired major in postsecondary education (Nagy, Trautwein, Baumert, K\u00f6ller, & Garrett, 2006) . Trusty and Ng (2000) , for example, examined students' mathematics self-efficacy and English self-efficacy and found students' mathematics self-efficacy was predictive of their postsecondary educational choices. Thus, students' perceptions of their verbal and math abilities within the I/E model may serve as a framework for understanding why some students enter STEM fields and some students do not. High math self-concept may lead to a career in a STEM field and a low math selfconcept may deter students from a career in a STEM field. Gender differences within the I/E model would be particularly illustrative of potential career-related decisions.",

This study will address several questions that arise when researching gifted adolescents' academic self-concept. For instance, do gifted adolescent females and males differ with regard to math/verbal achievement and math/verbal self-concept? If so, how? Further, do gifted adolescents use external and internal comparisons in order to establish their math and verbal self-concepts? Based on previous research, our hypotheses are as follows: Achievement in one area will positively affect one's self-1. concept in the same area but will negatively affect one's self-concept in the noncorresponding area, as outlined by the I/E model. One's math and verbal self-concepts will not be related, as 2.",

A clear understanding of the gender differences within the development of both math and verbal self-concepts might provide some explanation for why gifted females opt out of careers in the STEM areas, particularly if gifted females and gifted males are achieving in math at the same rate.",

The Self Description Questionnaire II (SDQ-II) was designed to measure the self-concepts of young adolescents aged 13-17 and is theoretically based on the notion that self-concept is multidimensional and hierarchically structured (Marsh, 1990; Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976) . The SDQ-II measures self-concept in the following areas: Mathematics, Verbal, General School, Physical Abilities, Physical Appearance, Same-Sex Peer Relations, Opposite-Sex Peer Relations, Parent Relations, Emotional Stability, Honesty/Trustworthiness, Total Academic, and General Self. Scores on each subscale of the SDQ-II range from 1 (false) to 6 (true). Thus, a higher score on the scale reflects a higher self-concept, whereas a lower score reflects a lower self-concept (some items are reverse coded). Extensive support for the reliability and validity of the SDQ-II has been reported in other research (see Gilman, Laughlin, & Huebner, 1999; Plucker, Taylor, Callahan, & Tomchin, 1997) .",

Results suggest significant differences between males and females with regard to verbal achievement scores, no differences with regard to math achievement scores, significant differences with regard to verbal self-concept scores, and no differences with regard to math self-concept scores. Females scored higher than males on the measures of verbal achievement and verbal self-concept. However, results suggest males and females within Gender Differences in Gifted 47 the current sample do not experience differences within the I/E model with regard to the way their math and verbal self-concepts develop. Although significant, the relationships between the variables in this study are all weakly related (see Figure 2) . The I/E model was only partially corroborated in the current study, thus supporting only one of the first two of our hypotheses. Consistent with the I/E model, achievement in one area was positively correlated with one's self-concept in the same area and was negatively correlated with one's self-concept in the noncorresponding area. However, students' math and verbal self-concepts were negatively correlated in the current study, which differs from the I/E model. The negative correlation between students' math and verbal self-concepts might be explained, at least in part, by the notion of \"negative interdependence, \" or the idea that two areas of abilities are unrelated. As M\u00f6ller, Streblow, and Pohlmann (2006) suggest, the belief in the negative interdependency between math and verbal ability, or that the two areas of ability are not related, can influence one's corresponding perceptions of abilities in those domains. Some students may believe math and verbal abilities are unrelated, thus influencing the perceptions of their abilities in those realms. Further, if one's actual abilities in math and verbal disciplines are unrelated, as evidenced in the current study (a significant difference was found between participants' math and verbal achievement scores), the correlation between math and verbal self-concept is more likely to be negative (Rost, Sparfeldt, Dickh\u00e4user, & Schilling, 2005) .",

Coupled with the notion that self-concept likely affects course selection, gifted females with feelings of negative interdependency might avoid courses in the STEM areas, and thus careers in the STEM areas, irrespective of the I/E model.
