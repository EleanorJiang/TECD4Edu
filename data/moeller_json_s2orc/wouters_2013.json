    "abstract": "The big-fish-little-pond effect model explains individual differences in equally achieving students' academic selfconcept by the achievement level of their reference group. Taking into account the multitude of reference groups in students' everyday school life, this study investigates which reference frame (i.e., classmates or friends) matters most for students' academic self-concept. Our sample comprised 2987 students (50% boys) from Grade 6 in 112 elementary schools (174 classes). Three dimensions of academic self-concept (i.e., global academic, math, and language self-concept) were considered. Using multilevel modeling, we found the predicted negative effects of class-average and friend-average achievement on all three academic self-concept dimensions. When comparing the effect of both group-average achievement variables, we found that friend-average achievement always had a smaller negative effect than class-average achievement. Overall, these results suggest that, when evaluating their academic competencies, students do not primarily rely on the most local comparison source, but on the most informative one.",

                "text": "Despite the abundant evidence for the BFLPE model, some topics have not been extensively studied. First, previous BFLPE research has mainly focused on students' school or class as a frame of reference (e.g., L\u00fcdtke et al., 2005; Preckel & Br\u00fcll, 2010; Seaton et al., 2010; Thijs, Verkuyten, & Helmond, 2010) . However, students' everyday school life consists of multiple potentially salient reference groups including their friends or educational track (e.g., Dijkstra et al., 2008; Pomerantz, Ruble, Frey, & Greulich, 1995; Wouters, Colpin, Germeijs, & Verschueren, 2009) . In particular, as children move to early adolescence, their friends tend to become a central social context shaping their development (Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 2006) . This raises the question of whether students use the achievement levels of their friends as an additional comparison standard. Second, in a school context these different kinds of reference frames are all accessible to students at the same time (Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, & K\u00f6ller, 2008; Wouters et al., 2009) . To date, however, the relative importance of simultaneously occurring reference groups has hardly been studied. In particular, no previous research has examined the relative effect of classmates and friends on students' academic self-concept. The current study intends to fill this gap.",

                "text": "Previous research has shown that friends affect children's school adjustment and that this impact intensifies when children move into (early) adolescence (e.g., Altermatt, 2012; Altermatt & Broady, 2009; Berndt, 1999; Cambron, Acitelli, & Steinberg, 2010; Cook, Deng, & Morgano, 2007; Lubbers, Kuyper, & van der Werf, 2009; Rubin et al., 2006) . Furthermore, peer socialization research has already shown that friends' achievement levels may positively predict adolescents' own achievement levels (e.g., Altermatt & Pomerantz, 2003; Berndt & Keefe, 1995; Cook et al., 2007; Ryan, 2001 ). Effects of friends' achievement levels on adolescents' academic self-concept, however, have hardly been investigated (Hendriks, Kuyper, Lubbers, and Van der Werf, 2011) . Hence, the question of whether friends' achievement also triggers a BFLPE on academic self-concept remains largely unaddressed. This is interesting considering that effects of friends' achievement may be different depending on the outcome under consideration. Social comparison theories in particular suggest that the effect of high achieving friends may be negative for one's self-evaluation, although it has shown to be positive for one's achievement (Altermatt & Pomerantz, 2005) . Altermatt and Pomerantz (2005) performed the only study that investigated classroom friends as an implicit frame of reference for students' self-evaluative beliefs. In line with social comparison theory, they showed that classroom friends' average achievement (operationalized in terms of grades) negatively predicted the self-evaluative beliefs of low achieving children, but positively affected those of high achieving children (although the latter effect was only marginally significant).",

In doing this, we extended the study of Altermatt and Pomerantz (2005) in three important ways. First, we focused specifically on predicting academic self-concept instead of a more global evaluation of self. As the BFLPE model specifically aims to explain academic self-concept formation, this extension is necessary to further test and refine the model. Second, we measured (individual and classroom) achievement through standardized achievement tests instead of through grades. This facilitates comparing achievement levels across classrooms and schools . Finally, we did not only examine the effect of classroom friends' achievement on academic self-concept, but also examine its predictive value above and beyond the effect of classmates' achievement level. This will yield a better understanding of the unique importance of classroom friends' achievement.",

However, regarding the predictive strength of both reference frames, we proposed two alternative hypotheses. First, friend-average achievement may have a stronger effect on students' academic self-concept than the average achievement level of the whole classroom ('friend dominance hypothesis'). This hypothesis is consistent with the local dominance effect model (Zell & Alicke, 2010) . Zell and Alicke (2010) suggested that individuals tend to rely on the most local comparison source for self-evaluation when multiple comparison standards are present. In the current study, friends are a more local source of information than classmates, which would imply a stronger effect of friend-average achievement on students' academic self-concept as compared with class-average achievement. This hypothesis is also in line the Self-Evaluation Maintenance (SEM) model in which students are assumed to feel more threatened when the one outperforming them is closer to them (Guay, Boivin, & Hodges, 1999; Tesser, 1988 Tesser, , 1991 .",

Previous research demonstrated that when individuals feel part of a group or when they are focused on emotional bonding (i.e., focused on social identity), they show stronger assimilation effects towards their comparison targets (Kemmelmeier & Oyserman, 2001 ). Hence, friends may evoke larger assimilation effects than classmates. Furthermore, friends may also induce smaller contrast effects than classmates, because students choose their friends and they tend, in general, to avoid choosing friends whose achievement level strongly differs from their own achievement level (e.g., Hamm, 2000; Huguet et al., 2009) .

All self-concept subscales were scored on a 5-point Likert-type rating scale ranging from 1 (false) to 5 (true).

Additionally, math achievement was measured through a standardized math test assessing multiple domains in mathematics (e.g., mental arithmetic, math problems, geometry, and fractions; Cortois et al., 2010) . Students were assigned either an easier or a more difficult version of the language and math achievement tests in Grade 6, according to their performance on the respective standardized achievement tests in Grade 5. Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to compare the results from these different tests across students. In a prior calibration study, common items across several test versions were used as anchors to equate the tests (Kolen & Brennan, 2004) . Using the IRT models, raw test scores from both test versions were then converted into scale scores with a common metric. For the data on reading comprehension a two-parameter IRT model (Birnbaum, 1968 ) was used, while for the mathematics data a three-parameter IRT model (Birnbaum, 1968) . To obtain a global measure of academic achievementparallel with our global academic self-concept subscalethe language and math IRT achievement scores were averaged. Furthermore, to create measures of class-average and friend-average achievement, all individual achievement scores were averaged for each class and each group of self-nominated friends.",

In our study, we did not control for clustering of students in schools because of the large overlap between clustering in schools and classes with 50% of the schools only having one class in Grade 6 and correlations between class-and school-average achievement variables ranging from .87 to .89.

Additionally, they used grades instead of standardized achievement tests.

Considering that the BFLPE is supposed to be the combined effect of two underlying social comparison effects (i.e., contrast and assimilation), the nonsignificant or smaller net effect of friend-average achievement may imply, on the one hand, that friends induce smaller contrast effects than classmates. Because performances may be more similar between friends than between classmates (Hamm, 2000; Huguet et al., 2009) , it is possible that contrast effects were smaller for friends than classmates. However, this explanation is not very plausible considering that correlations between individual achievement and friend-average achievement were not higher than those between individual achievement and class-average achievement. A second, more likely explanation is that friends evoke larger assimilation effects than classmates because the emotional bond is stronger between friends. As mentioned before, previous research in social psychology showed that when individuals are focused on emotional bonding, they show stronger assimilation effects towards their comparison targets (Kemmelmeier & Oyserman, 2001) .",

The local dominance model assumes that individuals tend to rely on the most local comparison source for self-evaluation (i.e., friends instead of classmates) when multiple comparison standards are present. Our findings suggest, however, that in weighing the available comparison sources, students evaluate both their locality and their informational value. Accordingly, when thinking about themselves in general, students may choose the most local social comparison source (i.e., their friends) because this source is also the most valuable in the global self-esteem area. However, when thinking about themselves academically, they tend to rely on a less local, but more informative source (i.e., their classmates). This may be particularly likely in educational systems where most information on academic achievement is provided at the class level (e.g., the class mean or median is mentioned on students' report card).",

                "text": "The present study also provides some additional findings. First, the results were robust across the three domains of academic selfconcept, suggesting that similar social comparison processes are at work, regardless of domain-specificity. Second, the results from the latent-manifest contextual model demonstrated the expected effects of gender and individual achievement on academic selfconcept. In line with previous research, we found that boys had a higher academic and math self-concept, but a lower language selfconcept than girls in the final grade of elementary school even when controlling for achievement, although the significant random effects suggest that these effects may be less robust than is generally assumed (e.g., De Fraine et al., 2007; Marsh, 1989a Marsh, , 1989b Nagy et al., 2010) . Third, as expected from prior studies (Marsh & Craven, 2005; Marsh & Martin, 2011) , strong evidence was found for a positive relationship between individual academic achievement and academic self-concept. The current findings confirm the BFLPE on academic self-concept in late elementary school, suggesting that social comparison processes are indeed operating in students' friend groups and in their classrooms. Because these processes may result in both increases and decreases in students' academic self-concept (depending on whether the groupaverage ability is high or low) and because academic self-concept predicts many other educational outcomes (e.g., academic achievement, intrinsic motivation, and effort; Bong & Skaalvik, 2003; Marsh & Hau, 2003; Wouters et al., 2011) , educators and school practitioners should be more aware of these social comparison processes and their effects on students (Dijkstra et al., 2008) . As a result teachers and school guidance counselors would be able to buffer some of the negative social comparison effects by discussing and framing these effects with atrisk students (e.g., relatively low performing students in a high achieving class). Additionally, the current study suggests that negative effects of being in a higher achieving group can be counteracted by raising social identification and emotional bonding in the classroom. As such, they may inspire future research on the limits and scope of the BFLPE and encourage researchers to continue the search for possible moderators. Finally, more awareness may result in a faster identification of specific educational circumstances which put students at risk for developing a lower academic self-concept, such as moving from a lower to a higher performing class (e.g., entering specialized gifted programs; Marsh, Tracey, & Craven, 2006; Wouters et al., 2009) .",

                "text": "Some limitations of the present study lead to interesting avenues for future research. First, data in this study were cross-sectional. Therefore, we cannot firmly conclude that group-average achievement variables play an antecedent role in the development of students' academic selfconcept. Longitudinal research may further clarify these relations. Second, social comparison processes were hypothesized but not observed; only their supposed net effect on academic self-concept was observed. Although increasing evidence shows that social comparison processes operate behind the BFLPE (Huguet et al., 2009; Marsh, Seaton et al., 2008) , future research would benefit from making these social comparison processes more visibleespecially with regard to the effect of multiple frames of reference. This could be done, for instance, through qualitative interviews digging into how students experience their academic context or through experimental research directly manipulating these social comparison processes (Cheng & Lam, 2007; Marsh, Seaton, et al., 2008) . Third, although we had several reasons to specifically consider classroom friends, future research may also investigate the effect of friends in general (i.e., including friends from outside the classroom). Fourth, it would be interesting to replicate the current study with a sample of high school students. Adolescents tend to spend more time with their friends, which may further increase the likelihood of mutual influences. Possibly, this may yield larger or different friend-average achievement effects (Steinberg & Morris, 2001; V\u00e9ronneau, Vitaro, Brendgen, Dishion, & Tremblay, 2010) .",

We found that the negative effect of friend-average achievement was always smaller than the negative effect of classaverage achievement. These findings suggest that students do not primarily rely on the most local comparison source (i.e., their friends) when evaluating their academic competencies, but that they tend to rely on the most informative one (i.e., their classmates). Overall, our findings underscore the need for more research on the simultaneous effects of multiple frames of reference as present in students' everyday school life.",
