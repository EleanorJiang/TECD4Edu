Our major aim was to extend previous findings on dimensional comparison processes for expectancies to task values while systematically comparing multiple value facets defined in expectancy-value theory. We assessed the expectancies, values, and achievements of N = 857 students in Grades 5-12 from two German academic track schools in five academic domains. The results for students' expectancies largely supported the predictions that were derived from dimensional comparison theory: We found strong evidence for negative cross-domain paths between achievements and expectancies in \"far\" domains such as math and languages, indicating contrast effects. There were also some positive cross-domain paths between achievements and expectancies in \"near\" domains such as math and physics, indicating assimilation effects. We also found similar patterns of cross-domain paths for students' values. However, the results varied substantially across the nine value facets under investigation. We found the strongest evidence for dimensional comparison processes for the value facets most closely related to expectancy (e.g., intrinsic value and cost facets), whereas we found only a little evidence for dimensional comparison processes for the facets of utility value.",

In previous research, both kinds of beliefs have been found to be highly domain-specific (e.g., Bong, 2001; Eccles, Wigfield, Harold, & Blumenfeld, 1993) . Students tend to favor one domain over another, and their expectancy and value beliefs about different domains such as math and English typically show only very low correlations (e.g., Trautwein et al., 2012) . In addition to expectancy and value beliefs in a particular domain, the intraindividual levels of expectancies and values across domains are key determinants of students' effort and choices (Chow, Eccles, & Salmela-Aro, 2012; Eccles, 2009; Trautwein & L\u00fcdtke, 2007) . It therefore seems important to investigate these beliefs in multiple domains.",

Students' expectancies and values are influenced by their experiences with different domains in the school context and the information they receive about their performances (Wigfield, Eccles, Schiefele, Roeser, & Davis-Kean, 2006) . Students attend to both their own achievements in different areas and the achievements of others (Butler, 2005; Ruble, 1983) . Marsh (1986) called such intraindividual comparisons across domains an internal frame of reference and comparisons with other students an external frame of reference. In their dimensional comparison theory (DCT), M\u00f6ller and Marsh (2013) discussed the nature of dimensional comparisons and also how the perceived similarity between domains impacts how students' achievements https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cedpsych.2017.10.003 and expectancies are related to each other across domains. They posited that comparisons between \"far\" domains (e.g., math and English) result in contrast effects, such that being good in one of the areas goes along with a lower subjective evaluation of one's competence in the other. Comparisons between \"near\" domains (e.g., math and science) can result in assimilation effects; being good in math also means being good at science.",

Important implications for theory, research, and practice have come from such studies. However, much less research has been conducted on how dimensional comparison processes affect constructs other than academic self-concepts. Recently, M\u00f6ller, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, Helm, Nagy, and Marsh (2016) proposed an extension of DCT, the so-called generalized IE model, in which they proposed that-besides academic self-concepts-other variables such as domain-specific motivational constructs are affected through the same social and dimensional comparison processes. Accordingly, some studies have shown cross-domain effects of achievement on intrinsic value and related constructs (Guo, Marsh, Parker, Morin, & Dicke, 2017; . However, students' task values are conceptualized as multifaceted, including intrinsic value, attainment value, utility value, and cost (Eccles & et al., 2005; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992) . New instruments that can be used to measure all of these value facets have only recently been developed (Gaspard et al., 2015 ).",

According to this theory, students' task choice and their engagement in a task are driven by two subjective, task-specific beliefs: (a) the expectancy that one can succeed in a task and (b) the value that one attaches to a task. Eccles and her colleagues defined expectancies for success as individuals' beliefs about how well they will do on a task in the future . This construct is conceptually related to other constructs that refer to self-evaluations of competences, such as academic self-concept (Marsh, 2007) . Indeed, academic selfconcept and expectancies for success have often been found to be highly correlated, and therefore, in research in which the EVT framework has been used, these constructs have typically been collapsed or used interchangeably (e.g., . In this study, we do not differentiate between them and use the terms \"expectancy\" and \"academic self-concept\" synonymously.",

Intrinsic value is defined as the enjoyment a person derives from engaging in an activity. This value component is closely related to the constructs of interest and flow and is supposed to develop on the basis of positive experiences with a specific activity. Attainment value indicates the personal importance of doing well on a given task and has been linked to identity-related issues such as confirming important aspects of the self. Utility value refers to the perceived usefulness of engaging in a task for achieving short-as well as long-term future goals. Finally, cost describes all the perceived negative consequences of engaging in a task, including the effort and negative emotions associated with the activity itself as well as the opportunity costs of choosing one option over another.",

In recent research, support has been offered for the theoretical distinction of multiple value components: Not only can four value components be separated empirically (e.g., Trautwein et al., 2012) , but some of these components can be further differentiated into multiple facets. For attainment value, Gaspard et al. (2015) found that it could be separated into the importance of achievement and personal importance. They also measured utility value with items indicating usefulness for attaining short-and long-term goals in different life domains (e.g., school, daily life, social life, job) and found that these facets could be separated. Some of these goals (e.g., being accepted by one's peers) might be particularly relevant for students during adolescence (Eccles, Midgley, et al., 1993; Juvonen, Espinoza, & Knifsend, 2012) . Several recent studies have also found support for the distinction between multiple facets of cost, including effort, emotional cost, and opportunity cost (Flake, Barron, Hulleman, McCoach, & Welsh, 2015; Gaspard et al., 2015; Perez, Cromley, & Kaplan, 2014) .",

Some of the correlations between expectancy and values reported in these studies were even higher than the correlations within the value components, thereby calling into question the idea that there are only two major motivational components (i.e., expectancy and value). On the basis of the definitions of these value components in EVT (Eccles, 2005; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992) , it is plausible that intrinsic value and cost are especially closely linked to students' expectancies because these components have been theoretically related to constructs such as flow (for intrinsic value) and fear of failure and perceived difficulty (for cost). Both components are also assumed to develop on the basis of prior experiences with similar tasks, which can be more or less positive depending on one's performance. In this study, we therefore wanted to take a closer look at the associations between expectancy and the different types of values and the extent to which they are affected by the same comparison processes.",

Although students already hold different beliefs about distinct domains in first grade , this differentiation between domains has been found to increase with age (Bong, 2001; Denissen, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2007; Marsh & Ayotte, 2003) . Trautwein et al. (2012) investigated the domain-specificity of expectancy and the four value components by examining how each of these five constructs in math were correlated with the same construct in English. They found that expectancy showed the highest degree of domain-specificity (r = \u2212.20), followed closely by intrinsic and attainment value (both rs = \u2212.18) and then by cost (r = \u2212.09).

In his internal/external frame-ofreference (IE) model, Marsh (1986) explained why this pattern occurs. He posited that students use two different frames of reference to compare their academic abilities: (a) a social comparison in which students contrast their perceived achievement in a domain with their peers' achievement in the same domain (an external frame of reference) and (b) a dimensional comparison in which students compare their achievement in a domain with their own achievement in another domain (an internal frame of reference). When students' math and verbal academic self-concepts are regressed on their achievements in these domains, these comparison processes result in positive effects of achievement on academic self-concept in the corresponding domain and in negative effects of achievement on academic self-concept across domains. There is abundant support for the predictions of the IE model from studies involving students of different ages and from different cultures M\u00f6ller et al., 2009) .",

They posited that one factor that influences dimensional comparison processes is the perceived similarity of domains (see also . Academic domains can be located on a continuum that ranges from verbal to math domains (Marsh, 1990; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) . On this continuum, both native and foreign languages are located along the verbal part of the verbal-math continuum, whereas math and physics are located along the math part of this continuum. Other domains such as biology, however, are assumed to be located close to the middle of the continuum and cannot clearly be assigned to the math or verbal part. Depending on the distance between two domains on this continuum, dimensional comparisons are expected to evoke either contrast or assimilation effects. Contrast effects between \"far\" domains (e.g., math and English) result in negative cross-domain paths from achievement to academic selfconcept. \"Near\" domains (e.g., math and physics), however, might be seen as complementary, and therefore achievement in one domain can also have a positive assimilation effect on academic self-concept in the other domain. In studies in which the effects of dimensional comparisons have been examined across multiple domains, support has been provided for these propositions through significant contrast effects for far comparisons and less consistent contrast effects or even assimilation effects for near comparisons (Jansen et al., 2015; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2015; M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & K\u00f6ller, 2006).",

They proposed that people enroll in social and dimensional comparisons on the basis of their perceptions of different domains, which \"may have consequences for any kind of domain-specific thought and learning behavior\" (M\u00f6ller et al., 2016, p. 5) . They assumed that one important precondition for dimensional comparisons to affect motivational constructs is that these constructs need to be domain-specific. However, they called for empirical investigations of their assumptions, looking at a broader variety of domain-specific constructs. We additionally propose that these constructs need to be closely related to students' perceptions of their competences in these domains, at least as long as students' achievements are used as predictor variables.",

Also, some value components seem to be conceptually closer to students' perceptions of their competences than others. The enjoyment of a particular domain and the perceived cost (e.g., the effort and negative emotions associated with engagement in this domain and the time lost for other activities) are closely linked to beliefs about competences in this domain (Eccles, 2005; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992) . Utility value, on the other hand, has been described as a more extrinsic source of motivation (Eccles, 2005; . When engaging in a task for reasons of utility value, students are not engaging in said task for its own sake but to reach a desired goal. Utility value might therefore be less affected by students' competences and more affected by other factors such as parents', teachers', and peers' beliefs and expectations.",

They found that intrinsic value was negatively affected by dimensional comparisons, and this effect was partly mediated by academic self-concept. found negative cross-domain effects of achievement on intrinsic motivation when examining math and sciences. Schurtz, Pfost, Nagengast, and Artelt (2014) found contrasting dimensional comparison effects on the development of students' interests in math and English. Goetz, Frenzel, Hall, and Pekrun (2008) found empirical support for negative cross-domain effects of achievement on enjoyment in math and verbal language classes. Recently, Guo et al. (2017) investigated how dimensional comparison processes affect intrinsic and utility values in different science domains. Their results suggest that intrinsic value is affected by both contrasting and assimilative dimensional comparisons, whereas the findings for utility value were less consistent. In addition, previous studies have provided support for the assumption that effects of dimensional comparisons on intrinsic value are mediated by expectancy (Goetz et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2017; Nagy et al., 2006 Nagy et al., , 2008 Schurtz et al., 2014) .",

By investigating both expectancies and values, we aimed to replicate the pattern of effects on expectancies reported in other studies (e.g., Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2015) and to extend the findings to values. Based on previous studies that have shown that multiple value facets can be separated and that these facets are differentially domain-specific and differentially associated with expectancies, a major focus of our investigation was on comparing dimensional comparison effects across value facets. For this investigation, we used data from German students in Grades 5-12 (Gaspard et al., 2017) who were asked about their expectancies and task values in five domains (i.e., German, English, math, biology, and physics). With respect to task values, we applied a psychometrically sound instrument that can be used to differentiate between all four value components and additionally between facets subsumed under the attainment value, utility value, and cost components. Our aim was to compare the findings across this set of value facets. However, as these facets have been explored in only a few studies before, our expectations were largely based on research in which the major value components were examined.",

First, in view of previous findings, we expected to find relatively high correlations between expectancy and value facets within a given domain. We also expected that these correlations would vary across the value facets with higher correlations for intrinsic value and the cost facets than for the utility value facets (Guo et al., 2016; Trautwein et al., 2012) . Second, we expected expectancy and value beliefs to be highly domain-specific. In other words, we expected to find that expectancy and value facets would show small to moderate correlations between domains. The pattern of correlations between different domains was expected to follow the assumptions underlying a verbal-mathematical continuum (Marsh, 1990) with higher correlations between domains that are close to each other on this continuum. However, we also expected the degree of domain-specificity to vary between the value facets with a lower degree of domain-specificity for the utility value facets (cf. Trautwein et al., 2012) .",

On the basis of DCT and previous research on academic self-concept (Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2015) , we made the following predictions for these regression analyses (see Fig. 1 for a conceptual representation of our predictions). Matching paths from achievement to expectancy/value in the same domain were expected to be positive. For cross-domain paths, we formed differential hypotheses that were based on the positions of the five domains along the verbal-math continuum. Dimensional comparisons between far domains (e.g., math and German) were expected to result in contrast effects (i.e., negative paths). Dimensional comparisons between near domains (e.g., math and physics) were expected to result in assimilation effects if they occurred (i.e., positive paths). As biology is situated in the middle of the continuum, we investigated the cross-domain paths between biology and the other domains separately and left their direction as an open research question. With respect to the constructs under investigation, we also formed hypotheses about the strength of the dimensional comparison processes. As expectancies are self-evaluations of academic achievement and have been the focus of DCT, the strongest dimensional comparison effects, in line with the pattern described above, were expected for expectancy. We expected to find similar patterns for intrinsic value, for which previous empirical evidence of dimensional comparison effects exists (Nagy et al., 2006) , and for cost, as it is both conceptually and empirically closely related to expectancy (Eccles, 2005; Guo et al., 2016; Trautwein et al., 2012) . Because of the lower domain-specificity of utility value and its weaker association with expectancy, we expected dimensional comparison effects to be weaker for the facets of this value component.",

In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, as in most other German federal states, students are tracked from Grade 5 on. About 40% of all students attending elementary school go on to attend academic track schools, the highest track, in Germany (Statistisches Bundesamt [Destatis], 2016). Due to the large proportion of students attending academic track schools, this school track also has the highest heterogeneity in terms of students' socioeconomic background (Trautwein & Neumann, 2008) . The two schools participated in a cooperation program of the LEAD Graduate School and Research Network at the University of T\u00fcbingen, which is aimed at improving the cooperation between educational research and practice. The schools in this cooperation program regularly participate in educational studies and receive information on the findings from these and other studies. One school agreed that all their 43 classrooms would participate, and the other school agreed that one classroom per grade level would participate (i.e., a total of eight classrooms, selected on the basis of the classrooms' availability on the day of data collection). The participating classes and students were roughly equally distributed across grade levels (with 77-117 students out of five to seven classrooms per grade level). Students' age varied from 9 to 18 years (M = 13.9, SD = 2.3). As is typical for academic track schools in Germany, students in these schools do not make any school transitions between Grades 5 and 12, and we found few differences in the relations across age.

All item stems included \"\u2026\" as a placeholder for the respective domain (e.g., \"I like doing \u2026\"). Students were instructed to insert the respective domain into the blank in their minds while answering the items. This grid format offers an economical way to assess motivational constructs across many domains and has been used successfully in previous research (see Sparfeldt, Schilling, Rost, & Thiel, 2006 , for a comparison of blocked vs. randomized questionnaire formats). The classes were randomly assigned to two different sets of instructions: One group was instructed to answer every item for all domains in a row before moving on to the next item, and the other group was instructed to answer all the items in a block for the first domain before moving on to the next domain. Preliminary analyses indicated that the two kinds of instructions produced similar measurement structures (see Gaspard et al., 2017) and similar dimensional comparison effects, so we analyzed these two conditions together. All items were rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely disagree) to 4 (completely agree).",

To measure task values, we used an adapted version of an instrument that was developed to measure multiple value facets in the context of math (Gaspard et al., 2015) . This instrument includes subscales for all four value components and can additionally be used to differentiate between subscales of attainment value (importance of achievement, personal importance), utility value (utility for daily life, utility for job, utility for school, social utility), and cost (effort required, emotional cost, opportunity cost). Confirmatory factor analyses showed that these value facets were separable in the sample under investigation except for effort required and emotional cost (Gaspard et al., 2017) . We therefore used a combined measure of effort and emotional cost. Table 1 presents sample items and scale reliabilities \u03c1 (Bollen, 1989; Raykov, 2001 ) for the 10 scales (latent factors) that resulted from confirmatory factor analyses in each subject (see Results section).

In all analyses, expectancies and values were represented by latent factors indicated by multiple items. Indicators were treated as continuous variables despite the fact that they had only four response categories (Rhemtulla, Brosseau-Liard, & Savalei, 2012) . We chose this analytical strategy because the models under consideration were quite complex (i.e., they included multiple dimensions) and because there was a non-negligible amount of missing data that needed to be handled in a principled way (i.e., full information maximum likelihood information; FIML). In comparison with categorical estimation procedures, the use of MLR estimation has been found to have little impact on structural parameter estimates (which were the major focus of our study) when there are at least four response categories and only moderate levels of nonnormality (Beauducel & Herzberg, 2006; DiStefano, 2002; Muth\u00e9n & Kaplan, 1985; Rhemtulla et al., 2012) . Skewness and kurtosis in our study were not extreme (cf. West, Finch, & Curran, 1995) ; across the total of 200 motivation items, the average skewness was \u22120.18 (with none of the skewness values exceeding 2), and the average kurtosis was \u22120.30 (with only seven items having a kurtosis between 2 and 4; see the Online Supplemental Materials for more information). Nevertheless, we acknowledge that treating the motivational indicators as continuous variables is a potential limitation of our study. 1 We first conducted confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to estimate correlations of expectancies and values within and between domains. We applied CFAs in each of the five domains to investigate the distinctiveness of the expectancy and value constructs and their interrelations. To avoid an overly complex model (i.e., 10 constructs in five domains, resulting in 50 factors), we then conducted separate CFAs for each construct under investigation to examine between-domain correlations. To test the effects predicted by DCT on students' expectancies and values in the five domains, we used structural equation modeling and followed the analytical approach that Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al. (2015) had used for academic self-concept. In these analyses, we modeled the expectancy and value constructs in the five domains as separate latent factors and regressed them on students' grades in all domains. We included method factors to account for parallel items across domains (Marsh & Hau, 1996) . We specified one method factor per item and restricted the method factors to be uncorrelated with each other as well as with all other variables in the model (see the Online Supplemental Materials for exemplary Mplus input). We computed separate analyses for all 10 constructs under consideration.",

Questionnaire data were missing because students were absent on the day of data collection or because they skipped individual items. In addition, students in Grades 5 and 6 (N = 222) were not administered the physics items because physics classes are not yet offered in these grades. These items were missing by design in Grades 5 and 6, resulting in a relatively high rate of missing data for physics (up to 32.0% to 37.2% for the expectancy and value items compared with up to 3.5% to 13.5% for the other subjects). Information on grades was also missing because the five domains were not taught in each grade level in these schools (i.e., physics was taught only from Grade 7 on, biology was not taught in Grade 8, and students could drop English, biology, and/or physics in Grades 11 and 12). To deal with these missing data, we used the FIML approach implemented in Mplus, in which all available information is taken into account when the model parameters are estimated (Schafer & Graham, 2002) . Given the high rates of missing data in Grades 5 and 6, we additionally ran two sets of robustness checks (see the Online Supplemental Materials for detailed results). First, we included students' grade level and gender as covariates in our structural equation models. Second, we ran the same set of analyses (without any covariates) using only the students from Grade 7 to Grade 12 (N = 635). Both sets of analyses yielded very similar results to those with the total sample without covariates. We therefore decided to use all available information and not to include any covariates because this approach corresponds to the typical analytical approach of the IE model in the literature (for a comparison of the effects with/without covariates, see Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2015) .",

Because this approach cannot be used with FIML, we used multiple imputation as an alternative way to account for missing data. To this end, we built separate two-level imputation models for each of the expectancy and value constructs, always including students' grades in the five subjects as continuous variables, students' responses on the respective two to eight items in the five domains as categorical variables, and students' grade level and gender as covariates. For each motivational construct, we imputed 20 data sets and then used these imputed data sets to run our structural equation models with the WLSMV estimator. The results (averaged over the 20 imputed data sets) were almost identical to those in which we used the maximum likelihood approach with FIML (r = .99 between the two sets of regression coefficients). However, for the effort and emotional cost scale, which was measured with eight items in each of the five domains, the imputation model included a larger number of categorical variables and did not converge.

We also expected that the degree of domain-specificity would vary between the value facets with a lower degree of domain-specificity for the utility value facets. To address these hypotheses, we computed CFAs to examine the associations between the five domains for all the constructs under investigation (see Table 3 ). Model fit was good for all motivational constructs (CFI \u2265 .967, TLI \u2265 .961, RMSEA \u2264 .039, SRMR \u2264 .045, see the Online Supplemental Materials for the exact fit indices). Students' grades showed moderate to high correlations across all of the five domains under consideration. The correlations for students' academic self- concept, however, showed a relatively high degree of domain-specificity. The pattern of correlations was in line with a verbal-mathematical continuum. Students' academic self-concepts in German and English (r = .30) and math and physics (r = .52) were relatively strongly correlated. Students' academic self-concept in biology was also positively correlated with their academic self-concepts in both German (r = .18) and physics (r = .17). Students' academic self-concept in German, on the other hand, was negatively correlated with their academic selfconcepts in math (r = \u2212.17) and physics (r = \u2212.12). All other correlations were nonsignificant. When comparing the pattern of correlations for the nine value facets, it became evident that the correlations for some of these value facets showed a pattern that was quite similar to that of academic selfconcept, whereas others showed a much lower degree of domain-specificity. Intrinsic value (r = \u2212.07 to .50), personal importance (r = \u2212.08 to .51), utility for job (r = \u2212.09 to .64), and effort and emotional cost (r = .09-.59) all seemed to be highly domain-specific.

We ran these analyses separately for the 10 motivational constructs, always including the motivational construct in all five domains and regression paths from all grades to all outcomes (i.e., 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 paths). Table 4 presents the standardized regression coefficients as well as the mean coefficients across different sets of paths for each motivational construct. The 25 regression coefficients were grouped into different categories according to our a priori predictions (see Fig. 1 for a conceptual representation of these models and our predictions). Paths leading from grades in one domain to academic self-concept and values in the same domain were classified as \"matching\" (5 paths); these paths were expected to be positive. Paths from achievement in one domain to academic self-concept and values in a different domain were classified as \"nonmatching\" (20 paths). The nonmatching paths were further classified into three categories. Paths between one of the two verbal domains (German and English) and one of the two math-related domains (math and physics) were classified as \"far\" (8 paths); these paths were expected to be negative. Paths from achievement to motivation within the two verbal or the two math-related domains were classified as \"near\" (4 paths) and were expected to be positive if they were significant. Paths between biology and the other domains were classified as \"biology versus others\" (8 paths). No a priori prediction was made for these paths. To compute the mean of the regression coefficients across these categories, we used the model constraint option implemented in Mplus, which also provides standard errors and significance levels for the newly computed coefficients. To reduce problems arising from multiple testing, we used a more conservative alpha level of .05/25 = .002 for these summary statistics.",

The major contribution of our study is that we extended the literature on dimensional comparisons between near and far domains to students' task values. To do so, we compared nine value facets. Some of these value facets (e.g., intrinsic value) were highly correlated with expectancy in the same domain, and these same value facets also showed a between-domain correlation pattern similar to that of expectancy. In line with these associations, regression analyses to examine how students' achievements predicted their values also showed a pattern of cross-domain paths similar to that of expectancy-indicating both contrasting and assimilating dimensional comparisons. Other value facets (e.g., social utility) showed weaker associations with expectancy and a lower degree of domainspecificity. These value facets also showed much weaker associations with students' achievements in the same and in other domains.

Similar to these other studies, the highest correlations with academic self-concept were found for intrinsic value and effort and emotional cost. Students with a high self-concept in one domain experienced these domains as more interesting and less threatening and exhausting. The utility value facets, on the other hand, showed lower correlations with academic self-concept, suggesting that utility value is related to students' perceived competence in a domain to a smaller extent. Instead, students' evaluations of how useful a domain is for achieving their goals might be more strongly driven by other factors; possibilities include other student characteristics such as their goals for the future or the extent to 2 Given the large range of grade levels in our sample, we also tested whether our results varied by grade level. To this end, we included students' grade level and the interactions between students' achievements and grade level as additional predictors in the regression analyses (see the Online Supplemental Materials for detailed results). We found that there were only a few interactions with students' grade level. Of the total of 25 interaction terms included in each model, zero to six interactions were significant for each of the outcomes. These significant interaction terms were roughly equally dispersed across the matching and nonmatching paths.

Relations were the weakest for social utility; this finding is not surprising given that this is the least academic aspect of utility.

One of the most interesting findings in this study is the large degree of variation in domain-specificity across the nine value facets. For intrinsic value, personal importance, utility for job, and effort and emotional cost, there was a distinction between different domains that was almost as strong as for academic self-concept, and the pattern of correlations was also in line with a verbal-math continuum. However, some facets of utility value (i.e., utility for school, social utility) showed much higher correlations between domains overall, and the correlations did not show a distinction between the quantitative and verbal domains. It may be the case that when thinking of school utility, students focus on school overall rather than on specific domains. Similarly, social utility has to do with students' peer relations, which they likely think about more generally, rather than how they vary in different classes.",

On the basis of the high between-domain correlations we found for some value facets, we suggest that these facets are more domain-general. Researchers might therefore consider measuring these value facets for school in general in future studies, as well (see Steinmayr & Spinath, 2010) . The high between-domain correlations could result in multicollinearity problems when such value beliefs measured across domains are used as predictors of students' academic outcomes. For other value facets, however, it seems very important to measure them separately for different domains instead of using domain-general measures. To further explore the structure of value beliefs in terms of their domain-general and domain-specific aspects and their associations with academic outcomes, it might be worthwhile to measure value beliefs at both levels and to explicitly model this hierarchical structure (see Gogol, Brunner, Martin, Preckel, & Goetz, 2017) .",

As posited in DCT, dimensional comparisons can affect students' academic self-concepts in two ways: Contrast effects will result for domains that are considered dissimilar, and assimilation effects will result for domains that are considered similar or complementary. Our results on students' academic self-concepts support these propositions. Comparisons between far domains consistently resulted in negative cross-domain paths. M\u00f6ller and Marsh (2013) discussed these effects with respect to the importance of individuals having accurate understandings of their strengths and weaknesses.

When developing such interventions, it seems important to keep their domain-specific nature in mind, at least for many of the value facets. It is likely that these interventions will need to be implemented in a specific domain to be effective (see O'Mara, Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 2006) . However, expectancy and value beliefs in one domain are also embedded in a more complex belief system, and it therefore seems unlikely that motivational interventions in one domain will work independently from those in other domains. Recently, Gaspard et al. (2016) showed that an intervention for fostering students' value beliefs in math had a negative effect on their value beliefs in language arts. As this was the first study to examine such side effects of domain-specific interventions on nontargeted domains, more research is needed to examine the conditions under which these occur. In line with our findings, one could also expect value interventions to affect value beliefs in similar domains positively if students perceive them as complementary.",

As in most research on dimensional comparisons, we used cross-sectional correlational data, and causal interpretations should therefore be made only with extreme caution. In our study, we regressed students' expectancy and value beliefs on students' grades in five subjects, which were correlated moderately to highly. Whereas this is a typical approach used in the literature on dimensional comparison effects on academic self-concepts (e.g., Jansen et al., 2015; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2015) , some of these regression coefficients would not have been significant when testing bivariate associations. However, it is important to note that the original IE model (Marsh, 1986 ) was developed to explain why academic self-concepts in different domains are typically uncorrelated, whereas achievements in these domains are correlated positively. It is therefore an important part of the theoretical assumptions underlying this model to control for achievements in the matching domain when testing dimensional comparison effects despite (or because of) their high correlation. Dimensional comparison processes have also been supported by the results of experimental and introspective studies (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) , and therefore, the crossdomain effects found in path-analytic studies seem to represent meaningful psychological processes. Future research is needed to examine whether this holds for value beliefs as well.",

Although our study highlights one of the potential mechanisms driving the development of these intraindividual hierarchies, investigating how expectancies and values in multiple domains combine to predict students' educational choices would be an important next step in bringing together these two motivational theories. Some first studies have already yielded promising results in this direction, indicating that educational choices are indeed affected by expectancies and values across multiple domains (Chow et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2017; Nagy et al., 2006) and that dimensional comparisons can explain important practical problems such as the lower proportion of girls and women in math-related courses and careers (Chow et al., 2012; Nagy et al., 2006) .

Although these are regular schools, the sample was not representative of German students but was positively selected in terms of student achievement. It is therefore possible that some of the findings in our study were affected by the characteristics of these particular schools and their student composition. However, the predictions that can be derived from the IE model for math and verbal self-concepts have been validated in different cultures M\u00f6ller et al., 2009) . Still, the perceived similarities of different domains along the verbal-mathematical continuum could vary by school context and the ways in which the domains are taught. For instance, biology and physics are taught as separate domains in Germany, and this might increase the perceived distance between them. Researchers might therefore want to explore how the school structure impacts dimensional comparisons, particularly regarding the conditions under which comparisons between domains closer on the verbal-math continuum result in assimilation or contrast effects. The generalizability of our findings to students in lower tracks also requires future investigation. Because researchers who have explored the development of expectancy and value beliefs have found that school transitions during early adolescence can have a negative impact on these beliefs Wigfield, Eccles, Mac Iver, Reuman, & Midgley, 1991) , researchers might also wish to explore whether and how such transitions affect dimensional comparison processes in the future.",
