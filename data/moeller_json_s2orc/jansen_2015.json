    "abstract": "Students evaluate their achievement in a specific domain in relation to their achievement in other domains and form their self-concepts accordingly. These comparison processes have been termed dimensional comparisons and shown to be an important source of academic self-concepts in addition to social and temporal comparisons. Research on the internal/external frame of reference model (I/E model) has frequently found negative effects of students' achievement on their academic self-concept between different scholastic domains (mathematics and the language of instruction) that are interpreted as contrast effects of dimensional comparisons. There is mixed evidence with regard to whether negative contrast effects or positive assimilation effects occur when students compare their achievement in domains that are more similar. In this study, we extended the original I/E model with 3 science domains (biology, chemistry, and physics). Using structural equation modeling, we analyzed the domain-specific selfconcepts, grades, and test scores of a representative sample of 9th-grade students in Germany (N \u03ed 20,050) across 5 domains. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry showed contrast effects to German, whereas small assimilation effects were found between mathematics, physics, and chemistry. This effect pattern was present for both grades and test scores. Achievement in mathematics and the language of instruction affected self-concepts in the sciences, whereas achievement in the sciences had no effect on self-concepts in other subjects. The results support the hypotheses derived from dimensional comparison theory that both contrast and assimilation effects can result from dimensional comparisons and that the 3 science subjects are affected differentially by these comparisons.",

                "text": "Academic self-concept has consistently been shown to be a multidimensional and domain-specific construct; that is, students differentiate between school subjects when evaluating their academic abilities . Further, they compare and contrast their abilities in different school subjects to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. For example, a student may eval-uate his or her performance in mathematics relative to his or her performance in languages. Such comparison processes have been termed dimensional comparisons (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) . Dimensional comparisons have been shown to play an important role in high school students' choice of college courses (Eccles, 2011) . For instance, students with high ability in both mathematics and languages are less likely to choose mathematics-related subjects than students with high ability in mathematics and lower ability in languages, because they evaluate their performance relatively (Wang, Eccles, & Kenny, 2013) . Dimensional comparisons were first described in the internal/ external frame of reference model (I/E model; Marsh, 1986) and recently reviewed in dimensional comparison theory (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) . Dimensional comparison theory suggests that students engage in two kinds of dimensional comparisons. A contrast effect is present if achievement in one domain shows negative effects on academic self-concepts in other domains; an assimilation effect occurs if achievement in one domain shows positive effects on academic self-concepts in other domains. Previous research on the I/E model has found strong contrast effects between the verbal and mathematical domains. That is, students seem to think of themselves as either a \"math person\" or a \"verbal person,\" even though actual achievement in these two domains shows high relations (Marsh, 1986) . This finding is consistent with structural models of academic self-concept that suggest a verbal-mathematical continuum of domain-specific self-concept factors (Marsh, 1990) . However, the evidence of the occurrence of assimilation effects is scarce. Only a few studies have examined the generalizability of the I/E model to more similar academic domains (e.g., mathematics and science), where assimilation effects would be expected, and the results have been inconclusive.",

Today, academic self-concept, the self-evaluation of a student's ability in a given domain, is one of the most important motivational factors in educational psychology (Marsh, 2007; Steinmayr & Spinath, 2009) . Its positive relation to academic achievement has been impressively documented in several longitudinal studies and meta-analyses (Chen, Yeh, Hwang, & Lin, 2013; Hattie, 2008; Huang, 2011; Marsh & Martin, 2011; Marsh & O'Mara, 2008; Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004) . Further, academic self-concept is positively related to other desirable educational outcomes, such as effort, attainment, high academic aspirations, and intrinsic motivation (Guay, Larose, & Boivin, 2004; Nagengast & Marsh, 2012; Nagengast et al., 2011; Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, Schnyder, & Niggli, 2006; Wigfield, 1994; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) and is a good predictor of educational choices (Marsh & Yeung, 1997; Parker et al., 2012) . In addition, relations to important psychosocial factors connected to school education have been shown: Students with positive academic self-concepts show higher life satisfaction (Suldo, Riley, & Shaffer, 2006 ) and a stronger sense of school belonging (Ireson & Hallam, 2005) ; they also experience teacher-student relations more positively (Bakadorova & Raufelder, 2013) and feel more socially supported (Legault, Green-Demers, & Pelletier, 2006; Ryan & Patrick, 2001 ).",

As empirical investigations have shown, this distinction is particularly strong between students' academic selfconcept in the language of instruction and their self-concept in mathematics: These two self-concept facets are almost uncorre-lated, even though there are substantial positive relations between student achievement in these subjects (Marsh, 1986; M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2009) . Incorporating these findings, the Marsh/Shavelson model of academic self-concept (Marsh, 1990; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) postulated that most academic domains (i.e., school subjects when high school students are studied, as in most studies on academic self-concept) are located on a verbalmathematical continuum, which can be reasonably summarized by the two higher order factors general verbal and general mathematical self-concept (for a detailed description, see Supplement A of the online supplemental materials). In the Marsh/Shavelson model, physics and chemistry are assumed to be on the mathematical half of the verbal-mathematical continuum, whereas biology is assumed to be located close to the middle of the continuum (Marsh, 1990; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988) . This is consistent with empirical findings that have shown that the physics and chemistry self-concept factors show a higher relation to each other than each of these factors shows with the biology self-concept factor (Jansen, Schroeders, & L\u00fcdtke, 2014) .",

Put differently, a student with high mathematical achievement would show lower self-concept in English than an equally able student with lower achievement in mathematics. The effect pattern summarized in the I/E model for mathematics and English has been found consistently in crosscultural observational studies (Marsh & Hau, 2004) , longitudinal studies (Marsh & K\u00f6ller, 2004; Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2001; M\u00f6ller, Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2011) , experimental studies (M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001) , different age groups (Ehm, Lindberg, & Hasselhorn, 2014) , and a meta-analytical review (M\u00f6ller et al., 2009 ; see Figure 1 for a depiction of the path model typically used to estimate the I/E model and the pooled path coefficients from the meta-analysis).",

Such social comparison processes have been studied extensively in educational psychology with regard to academic self-concepts (Marsh, 1987; Nagengast & Marsh, 2012; Seaton, Marsh, & Craven, 2009) . In the I/E model, social comparisons explain the positive effect of achievement on self-concept within each school subject. On the other hand, students evaluate their achievement in a specific subject in relation to their achievement in other subjects-an internal frame of reference. These comparison processes-dimensional comparisons-have been postulated to be important psychological processes for the development of self-concept in a more general dimensional comparison theory (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) , which is a recent extension of the I/E model. In the I/E model, dimensional comparisons explain the marginal effects of achievement in one domain on self-concepts in other domains. With regard to the two subjects originally examined in the I/E model-English and mathematicsthese effects are negative. One explanation for these effects is that students perceive mathematics and English to be subjects that require different sets of competencies. When students compare their abilities in these subjects, they contrast these abilities, especially if they believe that their achievement levels in the two subjects are negatively dependent . Besides these contrast effects, assimilation effects may also occur-that is, positive effects of achievement on self-concepts across subjects. Following dimensional comparison theory (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) , this should be the case when students consider the subjects to be more similar and complementary such that accomplishments in one subject might facilitate accomplishments in the other subject.",

Assimilation effects are assumed to occur when dimensional comparisons between more similar subjects than mathematics and languages are examined. Whereas contrast effects have been well documented in the literature (e.g., in M\u00f6ller et al.'s, 2009, meta-analysis) , the evidence with regard to the occurrence of assimilation has been sparse and conflicting: Although some studies have found contrast effects between subjects with similar characteristics (e.g., between mathematics and science; Chiu, 2008) , others have found assimilation effects (e.g., between mathematics and physics; . Therefore, even though the evidence is consistent with predictions from dimensional comparison theory in that the contrast effects found between similar domains have been much smaller than those found between distinct domains, it is ambiguous and inconsistent with regard to the question of whether and under what conditions assimilation effects occur. It has been speculated that the perceived location of academic domains on an assumed verbal-mathematical continuum may be related to the dimensional comparisons that students make between subjects (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) , but there is scarce empirical evidence for the location of different science subjects on this continuum.",

Broadly speaking, the closer together two subjects were on the continuum, the more likely achievement in one would positively predict self-concept in the other (assimilation). The further apart two subjects were, the more likely achievement in one would negatively predict the other (contrast).The position of the specific science domains on the continuum may be inferred from their relations to the two domains that represent the poles of the continuum (the mathematical domain and the verbal domain). Within the I/E model, this pertains to (a) the relations of achievement in the sciences to verbal and mathematical self-concepts and (b) the relations of achievement in German and mathematics to self-concepts in the sciences. These relations can be either positive or negative. For example, if biology is located closer to the verbal pole, negative relations between achievement in the other sciences and mathematics and selfconcept in biology are expected (contrast effects). Further, we would expect positive relations between achievement in German and self-concept in biology (an assimilation effect). If, in contrast, biology is closer to the mathematical pole of the continuum, negative relations between achievement in German and selfconcept in biology (a contrast effect) and positive relations between achievement in the other sciences and mathematics and self-concept in biology are likely (assimilation effects).",

Therefore, the results could also have implications for understanding educational choices the sciences. In their recent review, Wang and Degol (2013) concluded that \"although recent work on motivational beliefs leading to STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] occupational choices has begun to include self-efficacy, interest, values, and identity processes as key mediators . . ., little of this work has focused on the different occupational choices within STEM (e.g., physical sciences vs. biological sciences)\" (p. 20). In the present study, self-concepts in three science subjects were examined simultaneously within the I/E model for the first time. Studying dimensional comparisons across several science subjects could provide new evidence with regard to how science subjects are perceived by students. If self-concept in physics, for example, were to show contrast effects to achievement in German as we predicted, such dimensional comparisons processes could be one explanation of why girls, who typically perform better in German, typically show lower self-concept in physics and, thus, are less likely to choose college courses related to physical science (Eccles, 2007) . Therefore, our results may not only contribute to dimensional comparison theory but also have practical relevance in explaining educational choices in general and the differential \"gender gap\" in different science domains in particular.",

This classification is applied to the path coefficients found in the present study in Figure 4 . Independent of the measure of achievement, the five subjects can be aligned approximately along a diagonalsubjects showing higher contrast effects with achievement in mathematics also showed higher assimilation effects with achievement in German, and vice versa.

This is a result of the fact that contrast effects in general are stronger than assimilation effects. Further, mathematics and German are not directly aligned along the continuum. This may be because their positive relations with the \"matching\" achievement measures (e.g., self-concept in mathematics and achievement in mathematics) represent within-subject relations and are therefore stronger than contrast or assimilation effects across subjects.

Going beyond , we also examined standardized test scores and found similar evidence for assimilation effects. Further, our results contradict the results of Chiu (2008) , who found contrast effects between mathematics and science; we found assimilation effects between mathematics, physics, and chemistry. One explanation may be that Chiu did not differentiate between subject-specific self-concepts in the sciences and, rather, examined a general science self-concept. Because biology self-concept and physics self-concept are relatively far apart on the verbalmathematical continuum, the small contrast effects that Chiu found may have resulted from a combination of larger contrast effects between mathematics and biology and smaller assimilation effects between mathematics and other sciences that could not be disentangled when using a general science self-concept.",

Whereas there had been strong evidence for contrast effects, the empirical evidence for assimilation effects of dimensional comparisons was scarce and inconsistent. In our study, we identified small but significant assimilation effects within the domains of mathematics and science, thus confirming the predictions postulated by dimensional comparison theory. This means that given the same ability in physics, for example, students will show a slightly higher self-concept in physics when their ability in mathematics is higher. According to dimensional comparison theory, at least two reasons for such assimilation effects may be considered. First, students may think of the subjects as similar and complementary, meaning that skills they have acquired in one subject may help them succeed in the other subject as well or may even be a prerequisite for success in the other subject (e.g., mathematical techniques are that applied in physics classes). Second, because of the perceived similarity in the demands of sub- Table 3 (academic self-concept predicted by grades and test scores).

For example, on the basis of the pattern of effects in the extended I/E model, mathematics and physics would be perceived as more similar to each other than mathematics and biology, whereas German and biology would be considered more similar to each other than German and physics. Our data do not indicate, however, on which characteristics of subjects students base their judgments of similarity or distinctiveness. It is possible that the perceived similarity of the required skills or talents to perform well in a subject is an important characteristic for influencing the pattern of effects and that this characteristic is evaluated on a perceived verbal-mathematical continuum (see Figure 4 ). Besides perceptions of the required skills, further subject characteristics may play a role. Goetz et al. (2014) assessed students' cognitive judgments of the characteristics of school subjects and quantified their similarity. Using student interviews, they identified 13 domain characteristics such as the perceived amount and difficulty of the content, the relations to everyday life, and the amount of talent necessary for good grades. In their analyses, the quantitative subjects mathematics and physics showed similar profiles; that is, they were characterized by a high amount, difficulty, and coherence of content as well as veridical solutions. In contrast, verbal subjects such as German and English were characterized by a stronger reference to everyday life, more up-to-date topics, and more discussions among students within courses. In addition, the students considered the amount of talent necessary to succeed in mathematics and physics to be higher than that required to succeed in German and English.",

On the contrary, the verbal-mathematical continuum contributes to explaining why academic self-concepts are multidimensional and more strongly differentiated than student achievement (Marsh, 1986) . This multidimensionality is expressed in the fact that the correlations between the domain-specific self-concept facets are moderate. Further, the self-concept factors show distinct differential relations with school grades. That is, students may perceive these school subjects as being very similar in their verbal or mathematical demands, but their self-concepts in these subjects may still be substantially different because they are also affected by different factors other than dimensional comparisons (most important, their achievements in the subjects).",

However, there is some evidence from experimental and introspective research linking the assumed cognitive processes (i.e., dimensional comparisons and the student-perceived distinction between the mathematical and the verbal domain) to the I/E model (for a review, see M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) . Nevertheless, future research has to provide more rigorous evidence for the assumed verbal-mathematical continuum and the location of different domain-specific self-concepts on this continuum. For example, students could be explicitly asked how they would characterize certain school subjects and how similar they perceive these subjects to be (e.g., using pairwise comparisons of domains). These characteristics (e.g., the level of verbal and mathematical proficiency needed to succeed in a subject) could then be linked to academic self-concepts and to the empirical pattern of contrast and assimilation effects within the I/E model.",

Academic self-concept is not only reciprocally related to students' academic achievement (Huang, 2011; Valentine et al., 2004) , it is also one of the best motivational predictors of course and academic career choices (Marsh & Yeung, 1997; Parker, Marsh, Ciarrochi, Marshall, & Abduljabbar, 2014) . In one of the most comprehensive theoretical frameworks for explaining students' career choices, Eccles's expectancy-value theory (EVT; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) , academic self-concepts are an important part of the expectancy component. In this model, the expectation to excel in a college course, university major, or career is considered a prerequisite for students to be motivated to make that choice. The expectancy component is assumed to be strongly influenced by domain-specific self-concepts. In recent work on EVT, it has been pointed out that dimensional comparisons seem to play a bigger role than social comparisons for course and career choices, because students consider their intraindividual profile of strengths and weaknesses when making such choices (Eccles, 2007; Valla & Ceci, 2014; .",

Because students contrast their abilities in verbal and mathematical subjects, students performing well in verbal subjects (which include a higher proportion of female students) may be overly skeptical of their ability in the mathematical domain and therefore focus on the verbal domain by means of their course choices. If such choices are made at an early age, they may hinder further competence development in areas in which students perceive themselves to be weak in comparison with their achievements in other areas, because students try to avoid their \"weak\" subjects. Because dimensional comparisons are made for each student individually (i.e., within an internal frame of reference), such choices could be made even by students with high abilities in the mathematical domain-students who would be well suited for a STEM career.",

With regard to the sciences, male students are strongly overrepresented in physics, whereas female students are slightly overrepresented in biology (Eccles, 2007; Wang & Degol, 2013) . These proportions are consistent with gender differences in the domain-specific academic self-concepts (Jansen et al., 2014) . Therefore, the differential findings with regard to the effects of dimensional comparisons on academic self-concepts in biology, chemistry, and physics are of particular interest. Biology, on the one hand, and chemistry and physics, on the other, show very distinct patterns of contrast and assimilation effects. Physics shows contrast effects with German; that means, given the same achievement in physics, students with higher verbal achievement will show a lower self-concept in physics. This may help to explain the strong gender differences in favor of boys that have been found for the academic self-concept in physics, because girls typically show higher ability in verbal subjects (Jansen et al., 2014) . Moreover, such dimensional comparisons have been postulated as one factor contributing to the low representation of women in college courses in physics and engineering as well as occupations in these fields . It should be noted, though, that academic self-concepts are not solely determined by comparison processes. Other factors, such as gender stereotype endorsement and teachers' or parents' appraisals, also affect self-concepts (Kessels & Hannover, 2008; Spinath & Spinath, 2005; Tiedemann, 2000) . Further, academic self-concepts are just one of many factors contributing to the gender gap (Eccles, 2007) .",

Meta-analyses of self-concept interventions (Hattie, 1992 (Hattie, , 2008 have reported medium mean effect sizes, with even larger effects for students with previously diagnosed problems. It could further be shown that self-concept interventions also lead to improved academic performance (Haney & Durlak, 1998) , consistent with the reciprocal positive relation between academic self-concept and achievement . In further meta-analyses, the domain specificity of academic self-concepts was taken into account, and a much larger effect size (d) of 1.16 was found for interventions targeting a specific self-concept domain (O'Mara, Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 2006) . Therefore, a first conclusion is that self-concept interventions are effective but should be domain specific. Some interventions have focused on girls' interest and self-concepts in physics specifically. Among the promising interventions is attribution retraining, which may be realized through teacher training (Ziegler & Heller, 2000) or within a computer-based learning environment (Dresel & Ziegler, 2006) . Using such trainings, it could be shown that feedback patterns attributing success to effort and aptitude could enhance students' self-concepts in physics (Dresel & Ziegler, 2006) . Another promising idea is aligning curriculums in physics more strongly with topics with higher intrinsic value to female students. It could be shown that such curricular changes, along with interchanging phases of single-sex and coeducation, is beneficial to girls' physics self-concept (H\u00e4ussler & Hoffmann, 2002; Hoffmann, 2002) .",

For example, supportive feedback, attribution retraining, and individual goal feedback have been identified as effective methods of enhancing students' self-concepts (Craven, Marsh, & Debus, 1991; O'Mara et al., 2006; Ziegler & Heller, 2000) . Further, giving feedback within an individual frame of reference rather than a social frame of reference enhances students' academic self-concepts (L\u00fcdtke, K\u00f6ller, Marsh, & Trautwein, 2005) . Teachers may also challenge the belief that abilities in the verbal and mathematical domains are negatively interdependent, an idea that is common among students but that does not correspond to the pattern of positive correlations among ability scores. Finally, it should be pointed out that self-concept and achievement are reciprocally related, and therefore fostering domain-specific self-concept should be combined with further developing students' academic skills (Huang, 2011).",
