    "abstract": "The internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model by Marsh (e.g., 1990a) assumes two central information sources for the constitution of domain-specific academic self-concepts: (1) social comparisons (external frame of reference), in which students compare their own achievements with those of their classmates; and (2) intraindividual comparisons (internal frame of reference), in which students compare their own achievements in one subject with their achievements in other subjects. In path analyses, it has been found that the latter type of comparison leads to negative paths from achievement indicators in subject A to self-concept measures in subject B. To investigate the actual impact of achievement feedback and of the frames of reference on changes in self-concept variables, we analyzed math and German self-concepts immediately following the announcement of exam results in each subject. Participants were 258 7th-to 9th-graders. Path analyses using structural equation modeling supported the validity of the I/E model with respect to the impact of simultaneously given current exam results. In particular, German achievement had a negative impact on subsequent math self-concept.",

According to Marsh (1986 Marsh ( , 1990a they compare their levels of academic ability using two different, but connected, frames of reference. Within the external frame of reference, students compare their own ability and achievement to the perceived abilities and achievements of a reference group, usually their classmates. In making external comparisons, students compare self-perceptions of their own ability, e.g., in math and in German (as a native language), with the perceived abilities of their classmates, and this external reference serves as a basis for their math and verbal self-concepts. For example, if their math achievement is lower than their classmates' achievement, then their math self-concept will be lower, too. Because achievements in school subjects are typically positively correlated, these external (social) comparisons lead to the expectation that domain-specific self-concepts are positively correlated as well.",

According to this frame of reference, students evaluate their achievements in any particular subject in relation to their achievements in other subjects. This internal comparison is the second basis for the formation of a self-concept in each subject. According to Marsh, Walker, and Debus (1991) , better verbal skills lead to a better verbal self-concept based on external comparisons with classmates' achievements in verbal domains, but to a poorer math self-concept based on internal comparisons with one's poorer achievements in math. The relative weight of both comparison processes explains the moderate or nearly zero correlations between math and verbal self-concepts found in a variety of studies with different methodologies carried out in several countries (Bong, 1998; Faber, 1992; K\u00f6ller, Klemmert, M\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 1999; Marsh, 1986 Marsh, , 1990b Marsh et al., 1991; Marsh & Yeung, 1998; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1992 Tay, Licht, & Tate, 1995; Williams & Montgomery, 1995;  for an exception see Skaalvik & Rankin, 1990) .",

The external comparison leads to a high self-concept in both subjects, but the internal comparison may moderate the impact of the positive social comparison on the students' self-concept. The internal comparison results in a higher selfconcept in math (above-average with regard to both external and internal frames of reference) and reduces the self-concept in German (below-average with regard to an internal frame of reference).

Research investigating the antecedents of social comparisons (e.g., Festinger, 1954) suggests that comparisons typically occur under conditions in which relevant comparison information is easily available. Opportunities for social comparisons are thus always given after students have received their exam results in one subject. According to the internal frame of reference effect, one might expect that the simultaneous provision of achievement feedback in two domains would particularly foster comparison across different domains (internal frame of reference). This is typically the case in reports on final grades at the end of a school year, when students are given grades in all subjects taught. Alternatively, opportunities for an internal comparison are given when students receive simultaneous achievement feedback in at least two subjects. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the I/E model in an academic situation in which students receive simultaneous achievement feedback in two different subjects. On the basis of the I/E model, the main prediction is that exam results will have strong positive effects on the corresponding self-concepts within a domain and weaker, but significant, negative effects on the selfconcept across domains.",

As advised by Skaalvik and Valas (1999) , no motivational or emotional items were included because such items form different factors in some investigations (e.g., Skaalvik & Rankin, 1996) . The four items were ''I would prefer math if it weren't so hard''; ''Nobody's perfect, but I'm just not good at math''; ''With some of the topics in math that I don't understand, I know from the start that I just won't get them''; and ''Even if I do my best in math, I do not perform very well.'' The wording of the items for the two subjects was strictly parallel except for the specific school subject (i.e., math or German). Students responded to each item on a 4-point (agree-disagree) response format. Previous studies have provided evidence for the validity and reliability of the scale (e.g., M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 1995) . In M\u00f6ller and K\u00f6ller's study, all correlation coefficients of the domain-specific self-concept scales with actual grades in different subjects (German, mathematics, history, and physics) were above .60 and internal consistencies (Cronbach's \u03b1) were above .75.",

Following Hu and Bentler (1999) ; Marsh, Balla, and Hau (1996) ; and Marsh, Balla, and McDonald (1988) , we emphasize the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) and the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) to evaluate goodness of fit, but we also present the \u03c7 2 statistic divided by the degrees of freedom. According to recommendations made by the authors mentioned above, a sufficient model fit is indicated by TLI values above .90 (some authors recommend .95), RMSEA values below .08, and a \u03c7 2 /df ratio below 3. Although tests of statistical significance and indices of fit help to evaluate the fit of a model, there is ultimately some degree of subjective and professional judgment in the selection of the ''best'' model. J\u00f6reskog (1979; see also Marsh & Hau, 1996) emphasized that if the same measurements are used on multiple occasions, as is typical in longitudinal research, the corresponding uniquenesses will tend to be correlated and, in order to get accurate estimates of relations among the constructs, correlations among uniquenesses must be included in the model. In our study, however, the inclusion of correlated uniquenesses had no substantial effect on the pattern of remaining parameter estimates.",

All fit statistics considered here indicate a sufficient degree of fit (\u03c7 2 /df \u03ed 1.92, RMSEA \u03ed .06, TLI \u03ed .96).

This was also true for German (factor loadings of 1.00 and .60 at T2 and T4). Correlations among residuals were only significant for the second indicator of the in German self-concept (r \u03ed .30, p \u03fd .05). To achieve a reasonable degree of fit, the residuals of the grades in German and mathematics at T3 were allowed to correlate (r \u03ed .21, p \u03fd .05). All paths that   FIG. 1.

The pattern of results supports the I/E model for T0 and T1 achievement and T2 self-concepts (with the exception of the cross-domain path from T1 German grade to T2 math self-concept) as well as for T2 self-concept and T3 achievement, replicating results of previous studies (e.g., Marsh, 1986; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1992) . Although there have been some replications of the I/E model, there have not been many studies which explicitly deal with current and simultaneous academic achievement feedback in two domains and its effects on change in domain-specific academic self-concepts. In the present investigation, opportunities for both internal and external comparisons in two domains were provided by giving students simultaneous achievement feedback. The effects were, in part, congruent with the I/E model. In particular, the negative coefficients from the actual German exam grade (T3) to the crossdomain math self-concept (T4) together with the positive effects of actual exam grades on corresponding self-concepts, supported the predictions of the I/E model in a longitudinal study. Interestingly, Skaalvik and Valas (1999) also found evidence for the negative impact of verbal achievement on subsequent math self-concept when they analyzed data from the same age group. As in our study, math achievement was not found to affect subsequent verbal self-concept. This difference may arise because scholastic achievement determines students' math self-concepts to a higher degree compared to students' verbal self-concepts. Verbal self-concepts have developed, at least partly, before students enter school and may later be fed by more sources (e.g., feedback from parents and peers) than are math self-concepts. However, this result is in line with the majority of published studies as an inspection of all studies of the I/E model shows. Overall, effects of verbal achievement on math self-concept are stronger than effects of math achievement on verbal self-concept. Regarding the relatively small magnitude of the negative relations in our study, it should be underlined that in our longitudinal study the effects of T3 grades on T4 self-concepts are controlled for T2 self-concepts. The effects of T0 grades on T2 self-concepts are as high as reported in some other studies (e.g., Skaalvik & Rankin, 1990) .",

Although we controlled for the impact of this permanent achievement feedback by integrating the T2 self-concept measures in our analysis, it should be noted that the relations between T3 grades and T4 self-concepts may be influenced not only by the current exam grades, but by continual achievement feedback. To control for such processes, as well as for a deeper theoretical understanding of the psychological processes underlying the I/E model, it may be useful to carry out experimental studies. In M\u00f6ller (2000) , participants who had worked on two different types of tasks received manipulated achievement feedback with reference to internal and external comparisons.
