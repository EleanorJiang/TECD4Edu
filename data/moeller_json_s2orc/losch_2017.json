The study used multi-group structural equation modelling to investigate the predictions of academic self-concept, school burnout, achievement, and interest in mathematics and reading, in relation to educational aspirations for boys and girls. While certain factors were influential for students' academic aspirations irrespective of gender, some interesting differences also emerged. Academic self-concept and interest in reading predicted educational aspirations for both groups. However, gendered pathways emerged in how achievement and interest in mathematics predicted educational aspirations. Interest in mathematics predicted girls' educational aspirations, whereas mathematics achievement was a significant predictor for boys. School burnout had negative indirect effects through interest in reading and mathematics in both groups, but for girls, there was also a direct positive effect on educational aspirations.",

The research has also identified several academic and motivational individual difference factors that play a role in the process by which educational aspirations are formed (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . Moreover, recent studies have suggested that the pathways to aspirations may, at least in some respect, be different for boys and girls (Watt et al., 2012) . Uncovering the mechanism underlying the 'gendered pathways' to educational aspirations might offer a means of better understanding and intervening in adolescents stereotyped belief-systems. As such beliefsystems may unnecessarily limit future educational choices and occupational possibilities, examining their role in adolescents' goals and plans is important.",

Only a few studies have combined the indicators relating to these two academic domains (Nagy, Trautwein, Baumert, K\u20ac oller, & Garrett, 2006; Viljaranta, Nurmi, Aunola, & Salmela-Aro, 2009) . As the effects of performance and motivational beliefs on educational aspirations seem to differ both by gender and academic domain, the importance of examining multiple domains simultaneously to be able to control for the effects of the other domains on educational aspirations, is highlighted.",

As researchers have found that problems in students' socio-emotional functioning (e.g., school burnout) relate to low academic achievement (Kiuru, Aunola, Nurmi, Leskinen, & Salmela-Aro, 2008) , depression (Bakker et al., 2000; Salmela-Aro, Savolainen, & Holopainen, 2009) , unfavourable motivational tendencies (Tuominen-Soini, Salmela-Aro, & Niemivirta, 2008 , 2012 and educational dropout (Korhonen, Linnanm\u20ac aki, & Aunio, 2014) , we can expect them to play a role also in adolescents' educational aspirations. Consequently, our study aimed to contribute to previous research by (a) examining adolescent students' gendered educational aspirations at the end of compulsory education, using indicators relating to both mathematics and reading, and (b) including an indicator of students' socio-emotional functioning among the predictive variables.",

There is no universally accepted definition for the term educational aspirations, but it is generally used as referring to a person's goals and plans within an academic setting (Trebbels, 2015) . Researchers have defined and measured educational aspirations via the number of career plans per adolescents (Mendez & Crawford, 2002) , the prestige of their educational aspirations (Leung, Conoley, & Scheel, 1994; Viljaranta et al., 2009) , and the level of self-set educational goals (Vasalampi, Salmela-Aro, & Nurmi, 2009; Watt et al., 2012) . Educational aspirations have also been theorized as being either idealistic or realistic. While idealistic aspirations refer to the attainment level that the student desires, realistic aspirations reflect the actual perceived likelihood of success and more pragmatic expectations of completing a certain level of education (Rojewski, 2005) . However, in several studies focusing on educational choices, the operationalisations of educational aspirations have covered both idealistic and realistic alternatives, while no clear distinction has been made between the two terms (Chow, Eccles, & Salmela-Aro, 2012; Durik et al., 2006; . There has also been a tendency to examine educational aspirations within a specific academic domain, and the most common domain of interest has been mathematics (Chow et al., 2012; Watt, Eccles, & Durik, 2006) . In some studies, girls have reported higher educational aspirations (Mahaffy & Ward, 2002; Mau & Bikos, 2000) , whereas in other studies, boys' aspirations have been higher (Inoue, 1999; Mendez & Crawford, 2002) . There have also been studies that found no gender differences in educational aspirations (e.g. Ireson & Hallam, 2009; Watt et al., 2012) . Besides the possible gender differences in the level of educational aspirations, it also seems that the processes or paths that lead to these aspirations may differ as a function of gender (Domene et al., 2006; Watt et al., 2012) .",

Adolescents' aptitudes (e.g., IQ) and achievement (e.g., grades or grade point average) have been shown to display from moderate to strong effects on the level of educational aspirations (Guo, Marsh, Morin, Parker, & Kaur, 2015; Liu, Cheng, Chen, & Wu, 2009; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) and later achievement-related choices (e.g., university entry, Schoon, 2008) . In adolescent samples, mathematics (Ozturk, 2006; and reading achievement (Savolainen, Ahonen, Aro, Tolvanen, & Holopainen, 2008) have both been found to influence educational aspirations, and it also seems that the effects within these domains are similar for both genders (Durik et al., 2006; Shapka et al., 2006; Simpkins, Davis-Kean, & Eccles, 2006) . However, there is a lack of studies addressing the effects of both achievement in more than one school domain and gender, at the same time. As an exception, Mau (1995) included mathematics, reading, and science achievement in the prediction of educational aspirations. While achievement in all three domains predicted students' educational aspirations, the role of gender was not addressed. In other words, for now it is not well known whether the effects of mathematics and reading achievement on educational aspirations would differ when considered simultaneously, and as a function of gender.",

In general, individual differences in competence perceptions (Ireson & Hallam, 2009) and interest (Nagy et al., 2006) have been the most powerful predictors Wigfield & Eccles, 1992) . In many of the studies, students' competence perceptions have been conceptualized through self-concept da mental representation of one's personal competencies in academic domains in general, or in relation to a specific school-subject (Marsh & Craven, 1997; Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 1991) . In addition to educational aspirations , academic or domainspecific self-concept has been shown to be positively associated with students' academic achievement (Marsh, Hau, & Kong, 2002; Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004) , interest (Viljaranta, Tolvanen, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2014) , and students' overall psychological wellbeing (Chui & Wong, 2016; Marsh, Trautwein, Ludtke, K\u20ac oller, & Baumert, 2006) . In fact, current research suggests a reciprocal developmental relationship between achievement, self-concept, and interest, with a strengthening tendency during the school years (Denissen, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2007; M\u20ac oller, Retelsdorf, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2011) .",

Individual interest towards an academic domain is likely to develop when engagement with it is experienced as inherently rewarding (Renninger & Su, 2012) . Once interest deepens, it becomes intertwined with students' personal values, and may even form a part of one's identity (Renninger, 2009:; Renninger & Hidi, 2011) . Previous studies have shown interest to predict educational choices (Gottfried, Marcoulides, Gottfried, & Oliver, 2013) , whereas academic self-concept is a stronger predictor of achievement (Nagy et al., 2006; Perez, Cromley, & Kaplan, 2014) . However, in their recent cross-cultural study, Watt et al. (2012) found that self-concept and interest predicted educational aspirations differently depending on the culture. The researchers explained their finding by the differing educational contexts that emphasized and valued individual choice and achievement-related outcomes differently.",

One of the most salient reference-groups that children and adolescents become identified with, and which also has been shown to play a role in the formation of students' motivational beliefs, is gender (Cvencek, Kapur, & Meltzoff, 2015) . In a number of studies it has been shown that from early school years onwards, girls' and boys' self-concepts differ depending on the academic domain (Herbert & Stipek, 2005 ; see Spinath, Eckert, & Steinmayr, 2014 ; for a review), and that they are more likely to show interest in gender-typical academic contents (Fredricks & Eccles, 2002) . These kinds of stereotypical self-evaluations (e.g., domain-specific selfconcept and interest) have been suggested to work as mediators between academic achievement and students' educational aspirations and choices (Eccles & Wang, 2016) .",

In this study, well-being is examined in relation to educational context (i.e., academic well-being), and restricted to the examination of burnout, which may develop as a result of high imbalance between perceived demands and personal resources (Salmela-Aro & Upadyaya, 2014a). School burnout has been defined through dimensions that describe students' exhaustion due to school-related demands, cynicism and detached attitude towards schooling, and feelings of inadequacy as a student (Salmela-Aro, Kiuru, Leskinen, & Nurmi, 2009) . These dimensions have been shown to be associated with adolescent students' motivational strivings, whereby a tendency to minimize schoolwork and effort (i.e., work avoidance orientation) increases the likelihood of cynicism and sense of inadequacy. It is also noteworthy that even high-achieving and motivated students, and especially girls, have been found to be vulnerable to exhaustion (Tuominen-Soini & Salmela-Aro, 2014; Tuominen-Soini et al., 2012) . In general, the overall mean-level trend seems to be that girls are more likely to report higher levels of school burnout than boys (Salmela-Aro & Tynkkynen, 2012; Salmela-Aro, .",

However, they did not control for other possibly relevant predictors, such as academic self-concept or interest. In another study examining trajectories of school burnout among Finnish adolescents across their transition to post-comprehensive education, it was found that adolescents with lower level of educational aspirations were more likely to belong to the high-decreasing school burnout group, than to groups with either low-increasing or lowstable school burnout profiles (Salmela-Aro & Upadyaya, 2014b). Moreover, comparisons between genders revealed that girls were over represented in the high-decreasing burnout group.",

                "text": "In the expectancy-value framework, some studies have also examined how self-perceived drawbacks predict educational choices (Perez et al., 2014) . The concept of cost has been utilized to describe the perceived negative consequences of engaging in learning, such as required effort, or psychological well-being (see Eccles et al., 1983 ; for a detailed discussion). In addition, these studies have identified that cost measures predict and correlate negatively with students' interest (Flake, Barron, Hulleman, McCoach, & Welsh, 2015; Gaspard et al., 2015) and educational aspirations (Battle & Wigfield, 2003; Luttrell et al., 2010; Perez et al., 2014) . In fact, the conceptualisations (and operationalizations) of cost and school burnout seem to share some common features. The exhaustion component of school burnout is related to both dimensions of cost, namely, the amount of effort and emotional and psychological demands, whereas inadequacy and cynicism are more similar to the latter (Flake et al., 2015; Gaspard et al., 2015; Salmela-Aro, Kiuru et al., 2009) . However, there are also some important differences between school burnout and cost. First, school burnout is a more general negative emotion toward school (Salmela-Aro, Savolainen et al., 2009) , whereas cost is more domain-or situation-specific (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . Second, school burnout develops over a longer period of time, whereas cost is more situational and anticipatory. In fact, arguably, school burnout could be regarded as a consequence of experiencing prolonged cost (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004; Tuominen-Soini et al., 2008) . To summarize, despite the differences, both phenomena have been theorized and shown to hinder student motivation and engagement by tying up and burdening their psychological resources and decreasing positive affect ; Salmela-Aro & Upadyaya, 2014a; Tuominen-Soini & Salmela-Aro, 2014). As a consequence, students' capability and desire to set and achieve ambitious educational goals may also be diminished (Nurmi & Salmela-Aro, 2002 ).",

Interestingly, in studies contrasting two or more academic domains, gender has been found to moderate the effects of motivational beliefs on educational aspirations and choices. For example, Nagy et al. (2006) demonstrated that during secondary school, boys' self-concept and interest in mathematics affected their decisionmaking concerning advanced biology course choices, whereas for girls, the choices in mathematics and biology were independent of the contrasted domain's motivational beliefs. In line with this, a few studies utilising a person-centred methodological approach have investigated how an intra-individual hierarchy concerning interest in different domains predicts educational aspirations (Chow & Salmela-Aro, 2011; Chow et al., 2012; Viljaranta et al., 2009; Watt, 2005) . Echoing the gender-typical mean level differences, in these studies, boys were observed to be more likely to have a profile of high interest or task-values in mathematics and science compared to girls, who were more likely to display a profile with high reading interest (Chow et al., 2012; Viljaranta et al., 2009) . While in Chow et al. (2012) , the interest profiles fully mediated the relationship between gender and educational aspirations in physical and IT -related sciences, Viljaranta et al. (2009) found that their task-value profiles predicted educational aspirations for girls but not for boys. They hypothesized that boys' educational aspirations might originate from an objective criterion (e.g., academic achievement), whereas girls seemed to base their expectations on broader considerations, including their values and motivation.",

The model postulates that students' self-perceptions are dependent not only on social (external) comparisons, but also on dimensional (internal) comparisons, in which achievement in one school subject is evaluated in reference to another school subject (M\u20ac oller, Pohlmann, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2009) . Traditionally, this model has been used to explain the relations between mathematics and verbal achievement and selfconcept. In the external comparison process, high mathematics achievement is supposed to lead to higher mathematics selfconcept and high verbal achievement to higher verbal selfconcept. However, according to the internal comparison process, higher mathematics achievement will result in lower verbal selfconcept, after the effect of verbal achievement is taken into account. Consequently, while students achieving well in mathematics also often perform well in reading, they consider themselves \"as being good at\" mainly one or the other of the domains. There are robust findings across age groups, gender, and countries concerning the presence of this mechanism (M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) .",

According to Eccles (2009) , the external and internal comparisons of one's abilities and values are also a natural part of adolescents' identity development process, whereby they start to identify themselves more strongly with some academic domains than with others. This identification process, in turn, is likely to be influenced by gender stereotypes: out of two academic domains that an adolescent achieves well in, he or she will be more prone to emphasize and prefer the one that corresponds to the gendertypical expectations and norms. As a consequence, adolescents' academic choice behaviour and expectations concerning their educational and occupational goals may be influenced as well (e.g., Nagy et al., 2006; Parker et al., 2012) .",

Therefore, understanding which factors influence students' educational aspirations during this critical transition phase is important. This study adds to the existing literature in several ways. First, to our knowledge, no study has combined mathematics achievement and interest and reading achievement and interest to predict educational aspirations. This approach allows us to examine, whether achievement and motivational beliefs related to one or the other of the subjectsd mathematics and readingdare more important for students' educational aspirations, and whether the predictive effects vary as a function of gender. Second, only a few studies have examined the relationship between school burnout and educational aspirations (Salmela-Aro & Upadyaya, 2014b; Vasalampi et al., 2009 ).",

The original scale consists of 28 items, of which 7 items measure academic self-concept. We used a modified version of the academic selfconcept scale that included one additional item (see Korhonen et al., 2014) . For each item in the academic self-concept scale, there were two statements. First, the students had to decide if they were more like the young person described on the left-hand side of the statement or more like the one depicted on the right-hand side. Second, they had to mark whether the statement (e.g. 'Like school, doing well; Understand what I read') was completely true or just partly true for them. We scored the responses on a four-point scale ranging from least competent (1) to most competent (4). The original scale was in English; consequently, we needed to assure the validity of the instrument translation. Since the scale was also available in Finnish and Norwegian, a multi-language team translated the questionnaire from Norwegian to Swedish and from Finnish to Swedish, and compared the two translations to determine their similarity.",

                "text": "To measure students' interest in mathematics and Swedish (i.e., mother tongue), we used teacher ratings due to the fact that students' self-reports with regard to these constructs were not available. Students' mathematics and Swedish teachers were asked to evaluate their students' motivation and activity in class and rate the students' interest in these subjects on a five-point Likert scale. They received a name list of their students by class (e.g., class 9b) and were requested to fill in the ratings for every student. Teacherreports on students' interest and motivation have been used in several studies focusing on younger children (Baroody & Diamond, 2013; Edens & Potter, 2013; Fisher, Dobbs-Oates, Doctoroff, & Arnold, 2012; Pakarinen et al., 2011) , and they have been found to relate to students' self-reports (Guthrie et al., 2004; Wigfield et al., 2008) , to observational data on students' motivational engagement (e.g., enjoyment and participation, Baroody & Diamond, 2013; Fisher et al., 2012) , thus lending support for the validity of the measures. Further, in their study among adolescents, Dicke, L\u00fcdtke, Trautwein, Nagy, and Nagy (2012) reported that teacher ratings of students' mastery motivation statistically significantly predicted corresponding student ratings in five different school subjects. Consequently, while not being extensively studied, there is evidence supporting the use of teacher-ratings as indicators of student motivation and interest (see also, Wigfield & Cambria, 2010) . However, it is important to acknowledge that we do not claim them to be identical with students' self-reports. It is highly likely that the measures by different raters capture different aspects of the phenomenon, teachers focusing more on students' observable behaviour (e.g., attention focusing and participation) in classroom situations (Friedrich, Jonkmann, Nagengast, Schmitz, & Trautwein, 2013; Kaiser, Retelsdorf, S\u00fcdkamp, & M\u20ac oller, 2013) .",

Moreover, we utilized the MPLUS (version 7) program (Muth en & Muth en, 1998e2013) to conduct all of the analyses. Previous research has shown that the items from the mathematics test load on a single mathematics factor, whereas word and reading comprehension items load on a reading factor (Korhonen, Linnanm\u20ac aki, & Aunio, 2012) . In line with this, we randomly parcelled the 40 math items into 4 item parcels. We then used these parcels as factor indicators for the mathematics construct. The benefits of parcelling include decreased error variances, fewer non-normalities, increased common variance, model parsimony and improved model fit (Bandalos, 2002) . We expected that the items measuring academic self-concept from Harter's Perceived Competence Scale for Children (1982) would load on a single academic self-concept factor. On the basis of previous research (Salmela-Aro, Kiuru et al., 2009; Tuominen-Soini et al., 2012) , we expected that items from the SBI would load on three separate factors (EXH, CYN and INAD), and that these would serve as indicators of a higher order overall school burnout factor. We used the two statements concerning educational aspirations as factor indicators for the educational aspirations construct. Since we measured interest in the respective domain with only one item, we added these constructs to the model as manifest variables. In all analyses, we used maximum likelihood with robust standard errors (MLR) as the estimator due to the slight nonnormality in the measures. We used chi-square (c 2 ), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) as model-fit indicators. The CFI and TLI vary along a 0-to-1 continuum, and values greater than 0.90 and 0.95 typically reflect acceptable and excellent fit to the data, respectively. RMSEA values of less than 0.05 and 0.08 reflect a close fit and a reasonable fit to the data, respectively (Marsh, Hau, & Wen, 2004) . To be able to test the significance of indirect effects bootstrap confidence intervals (95%) with 1000 bootstrap draws were used (Preacher & Hayes, 2008; Shrout & Bolger, 2002) . The indirect effect can be considered to be statistically significant if the confidence interval excludes zero.",

One can use chi-square difference testing to measure the statistical significance between nested models (Bentler, 1990) . Another viable option is to compare fit indices between models (Chen, 2007) . Since chi-square difference testing tends to be biased toward significance when the sample size is large (see Marsh, Hau, Balla, & Grayson, 1998) , we decided to compare the models in terms of fit indices (CFI and RMSEA). According to Chen (2007) , support for the more parsimonious model requires a change in CFI (DCFI) of less than 0.01 or a change in RMSEA (DRMSEA) of less than 0.015.",

These results fit well with the literature on educational aspirations suggesting that motivational beliefs mediate the relationship between achievement and educational aspirations (e.g., Parker et al., 2014) . However, the total effect (the sum of direct and indirect effects between two variables) of reading achievement on educational aspirations was not significant for boys, which implies that reading achievement overall did not play a significant part in boys' aspirations besides the small indirect effect via interest.

For both genders, high mathematics achievement was related to high interest in the domain, but for boys, the level of interest was not predictive of their educational aspirations. Previous studies have suggested that when making educational or occupational choices related to mathematics or the STEM-fields in general, boys tend to rely more on achievement in their decisionmaking processes (Nagy et al., 2006; Viljaranta et al., 2009) , while girls' choices are more directed by their interests (Chow et al., 2012; Watt et al., 2012) . Although in this study, the focus was not on students' domain-specific choices but the level of their general educational aspirations, it seems that a similar trend applies: for boys, mathematics achievement plays more an important role than interest in how high they aim in education, while the opposite seems to be more typical for girls. Furthermore, contrary to the effects of reading achievement, the total effect of mathematics achievement on educational aspirations was significant for boys but not for girls.

In addition, it has been suggested that gender could moderate the internal and external comparison processes related to students' ability and value perceptions (Eccles, 2009; Nagy et al., 2006) . In other words, in line with gendertypical biases (Meece, Glienke, & Burg, 2006) , it might be expected that boys would show more confidence in and place more value on mathematics, while girls would emphasize their reading competencies and interest. Further, it could be suggested that due to the comparison processes, the priority placed on these domains would result in different predictive effects on educational aspirations as a function of gender. Based on this reasoning, in our study, the reading domain should have been a stronger predictor of girls' aspirations than the mathematics domain, and the opposite pattern would have applied for boys.",

It seems that boys identify themselves more strongly with the mathematics domain than with the reading domain and consequently, place more emphasis on mathematics achievement, while the opposite pattern may be more likely for girls. This was reflected in the gendered pathways from the effects of achievement on educational aspirations. It is worth noting that although the total effects were non-significant there was still small significant indirect effects through interest in the gender-atypical domain for both genders. This finding suggest that within these domains, in order for achievement to have an effect on aspirations, the student should be interested. However, our results displayed a somewhat different pattern of associations in terms of interest measures. First, girls' educational aspirations were predicted by both interest in reading and mathematics, the latter showing a stronger effect. This result is comparable to Nagy et al. (2006) finding suggesting that for girls, intrinsic values related to contrasted academic domains seem to develop independently of each other. Second, we did not find indications of the cross-domain effects concerning interest for boys either. Rather, our results suggested that for boys, achievement is more important in terms of mathematics, while interest in reading also contributes to their educational aspirations. To conclude, we found some indications of the dimensional comparison processes with regard to achievement but not with regard to interest. Unfortunately, our study lacked measures of students' domain-specific self-concept that would have been interesting to include in the model in order to interpret the results more closely within the I/E model framework.",

One explanation for this could be that academic self-concept is a domain-general construct, whereas we measured interest with domain-specific measures, hence dividing the interest effects between reading and mathematics. Furthermore, results might have differed between genders if domain-specific self-concept had been measured. The finding could also relate to educational culture, as previous cross-cultural research has found cultural differences in the strength of the relationships between self-concept, interest, and educational aspirations (Watt et al., 2012) . In Finland, after completing compulsory education, students choose between general upper secondary education (academic track) and vocational upper secondary education (vocational track). In general, it is more difficult to get admitted to general upper secondary, and therefore students' beliefs in their abilities are probably more important than their interests during this transition from lower secondary to upper secondary education. The result also highlights the importance of academic self-concept for students' educational aspirations. Promoting students' selfconcept is not only important for their achievement (Marsh et al., 2002) , but also for their future educational careers (Nagengast & Marsh, 2012) .",

In addition, higher level of school burnout was directly related to higher level of educational aspirations for girls, whereas this effect was not observed among boys. In line with recent studies on the consequences of students' socio-emotional strain (Flake et al., 2015; Gaspard et al., 2015; Perez et al., 2014) , school burnout negatively predicted interest in both reading and mathematics, and through them, educational aspirations. Our study thus adds to existing literature by demonstrating the association of school burnout with students' educational aspirations, even when controlling for achievement, interest and self-concept. This result can also be taken to support the importance of including the cost component in the expectancy-value model. Even though cost is an established part of the model theoretically (Wigfield & Cambria, 2010) , empirical studies have only recently started to acknowledge it. Especially, it would be important to examine the consequences of prolonged cost, of which school burnout might be one possibility (Salmela-Aro & Upadyaya, 2014a) .",

This path was not significant for boys, which is in line with previous findings showing that even though girls are more engaged in school (Martin, 2004) , they may feel more stress as a result of the demands they set upon themselves (Matud, 2004; Salmela-Aro & Tynkkynen, 2012) .

As the last grade of compulsory school is a demanding phase for some of the students (Salmela-Aro & Upadyaya, 2014b), resources should be targeted for the availability of school counsellors, and besides students' academic achievement, attention should be paid to their motivation and socio-emotional well-being. Echoing previous studies, school burnout was shown to have maladaptive consequences (Korhonen et al., 2014; Salmela-Aro, Savolainen, et al., 2009) .

It is also possible that gender affects teachers' evaluations of student characteristics (Mullola et al., 2012) and hence, the results concerning interest must be interpreted cautiously. However, interest has been defined as a motivational variable that on its part describes the quality of student engagement (Ainley, 2012) , and it can be suggested that teacher evaluations reflect adolescents' engagement from the perspective of their classroom behaviour and task involvement (e.g., Wigfield et al., 2008) . Moreover, we were able to identify significant effects from the interest measures to educational aspirations even after controlling for students' school achievement. A further limitation is that we used a domain general measure of academic self-concept instead of domain-specific measures in reading and mathematics. This prevented us from disentangling possible gender effects in how reading and mathematics self-concepts predict educational aspirations. We suggest that future studies also use domain-specific measures of selfconcept. Finally, as developmental processes are important when studying the relations between achievement and different motivational beliefs, a longitudinal design would be warranted. Likewise, although aspirations predict actual educational attainment and career choice, future studies could follow their participants through tertiary education to working life.",

As students' motivational beliefs are differentiated across academic domains and by gender, examining their concurrent effects may produce different results than when focusing only on one domain at a time. We found evidence of both between-and within-domain gender differences in how achievement and interest predicts aspirations. More specifically, mathematics achievement had a stronger and direct effect on educational aspirations for boys, while reading achievement was more important for girls. In this respect, our results can be taken to reflect the gender-typical comparison processes between the two domains. However, interest in reading predicted educational aspirations for both genders, while interest in mathematics only predicted girls' educational aspirations. While warranting replication, in our study, gender-atypical interests also seemed to play a role in the level of adolescents' educational aspirations. Regarding school burnout and educational aspirations our study showed that their relationship was mainly mediated by the interest variables. However, for girls, school burnout also had a positive direct effect on educational aspirations. Thus, we believe that our study both corroborated and extended the previous research not only by combining the two contrasted but central academic domains, mathematics and reading, in the same study design, but also by taking into account indices of students' academic well-being. Besides achievement, motivation and emotional resources are needed to support adolescents' striving towards their desired educational goals.",
