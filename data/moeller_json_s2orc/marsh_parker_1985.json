As an example, Marsh, Relich, and Smith (1983) showed that mathematics achievement was substantially correlated with Mathematics self-concept (.55), less correlated with self-concepts in other academic areas (Reading .21, and School .43), and uncorrected with self-concepts in four nonacademic areas.

Grade levels in this school, as in most high schools in this state, range from year 7 (mostly 12 year olds) to year 12 (mostly 17 year olds). Historically, in this state, students complete schooling through year 10 which is the normal \"leaving age\" at which time a School Certificate is awarded; those who continue on to years 11 and 12 generally have aspirations for higher education. Years 11 and 12 courses are designed to be a 2-year program where the curriculum is primarily academic and oriented toward preparation for the Higher School Certificate examinations which are taken in year 12. Since this school had so few students in years 11 (48) and 12 (24), and these years are similar, they are considered to be one grade in this study.

None of the differences among the other years reached statistical significance at p < .05, nor did the difference between achievement scores in years 11 and 12. This is consistent with the self-selection which takes place after year 10, and supports the decision to combine students from years 11 and 12 into a single group.

This procedure of pairing item responses is typically used in factor analyses of responses to the SDQ and the SDQ III. Limitations in the factor analysis procedure (i.e., the SPSS procedure is limited to 100 variables) and cost considerations necessiiated this decision. Nevertheless, further advantages result from the use of item pairs (see Marsh & O'Niell, 1983 , for further discussion). In particular, each variable is more reliable, has less unique variance, and is less likely to be affected by the idiosyncratic wording of a particular item when the analysis is performed on responses to item pairs. The SPSS procedure was also used to create factor scores to represent each scale (see Nie et al., 1975) .",

Correlations among the oblique factors (see Table II ) tend to be small, varying between -.06 and +.35. The highest correlations occur between the General Self and other scales (median r = .20), between the School scale and the other two academic scales (.33 and .30) , and between the Physical Appearance and Opposite Sex scales (r = .33). Thus, the pattern of factor loadings provides clear support for the scales that the SDQII was designed to measure. As part of this factor analysis, factor scores were computed (see Nie et al., 1975) , and these were used in subsequent analyses. The pattern of correlations among these factor scores is similar to that shown in Table II , though the magnitude is somewhat higher (median r = .17 vs. .13). The 11 factor scores were also correlated with each other separately for each grade level and the median correlations were .12, .17, .18, .17, and .17 for years 7 through 11/12. Thus, there is no evidence that adolescent selfconcepts become more distinct (i.e., less correlated) with increasing age, as suggested in the Shavelson model. Finally, the 11 factor scores were also correlated with unweighted scale scores determined by simply summing the unweighted responses of items designed to measure each scale. The correlations between the factor scores and the matching scale scores were extremely high (median r = .97) and further demonstrate the clarity of the factor structure.",

The clarity of the factor structure supports the construct validity of responses to the SDQ II and the Shavelson model on which it was based. While the pattern of correlations among the SDQ II factors suggests that some higher order factors may exist, the size of the correlations argues against any strong hierarchical ordering of the SDQ II dimensions. While comparisons among the different SDQ instruments are difficult to make, correlations among the SDQ II scales seem to be smaller than those for the SDQ (the preadolescent form) and larger than those for the SDQ III (the university-age form). Nevertheless, there is no indication that the magnitude of correlations among the SDQ II scales varies over the age range considered in this study. Thus, while adolescent self-concepts may be more differentiated than those of preadolescents, they do not appear to become more differentiated during adolescent years. Wylie (1979) argued that there was no convincing support for either sex or age effects in total self-concept. The sex differences found here agree with that conclusion for the total self score, but also show that there are sex differences in specific scales, some favoring boys and some favoring girls, which cancel each other out when the scores are summed across all scales. These conclusions are similar to those based on responses to the SDQ by preadolescent children. The age effects reported here do not support Wylie's conclusion even for the total score. In the total score and most of the individual scales, there is a significant nonlinear age trend. However, many of the studies in Wylie's review only looked for linear effects. Our results suggest that the linear relationship could be nonsignificant, positive or negative, depending on the particular age range that was examined. Marsh, Barnes, Cairns, and Tidman (1984) examined sex and age effects in grades 2-5 with the SDQ. Though not strictly comparable, it is interesting to contrast the findings from the two studies. In both studies the effects of sex and age were statistically independent in that there was no sex-bygrade interaction. In neither study did the effects of age or sex account for more than 10% of the variance in any of the self-concept scales. In neither study was the effect of sex significant for the sum of responses across all items, and the direction of significant effects for different scales varied. For both studies the age effect was statistically significant, and generally consistent across the different self-concept scales, but the form of the age effect differed for the two studies. During preadolescent years, the effect of age was primarily linear, with self-concept declining with age. For adolescent years the effect was nonlinear; self-concept appears to reach its lowest point with year 9 students and then to rise in year 10 and the year 11/12 samples.",

We propose that this extreme separation is due to an internal comparison process. According to this proposal, students compare their own relative abilities in different academic areas, as well as compare these abilities with those of other students. Consider, for example the student who is below average in both verbal and mathematics skills, but is better at mathematics than English. For this student, mathematics skills are below average relative to other students (an external comparison) but higher than average relative to hii other academii skills (an internal comparison). Depending on how these two components are weighted, the student may have an average or even above average Math self-concept. The external comparison process will lead to a positive correlation between Verbal and Math self-concepts, the internal comparison process will lead to a negative correlation, and the joint operation of both will produce relatively uncorrelated self-concepts which are consistent with empirical findings. This model is also consistent with the reversal of signs in beta weights observed in Table VII . According to this proposal a high Math self-concept will be more likely when mathematics skills are good (the external comparison) and when the mathematics skills are much better than verbal skills (the internal comparison). Thus, once the effect of math skills is controlled for, it is the difference eetween math and derbal lkills that contributes to the prediction of math self-concept. Hence, the sign of the beta weight for verbal skills should be negative. The ability of this model to account for these seemingly paradoxical results makes it quite appealing, though it needs further investigation.",

According to this model, students appraise their own academic ability, compare this with the observed abilities of other children in their frame of reference, and use this relativistic impression of their ability as one basis for forming their academic self-concept. Thus, a given child will see him or herself to be relatively more able in a low ability school and will form a more favorable self-concept than if the same child attends a high ability school. The model was strongly supported in a study based on preadolescent self-concepts for sixth grade students in high and low ability schools that were not selective other than on the basis of locales. There, the basis of comparison-other students in the same school who live in the same area-is clear. To the extent that these findings generalise to the present study, a student near the top of one stream might be expected to have a higher academic self-concept than if the same student were near the bottom of the next more able stream. However, the frame of reference actually used by students (i.e., the school, other students in their stream, etc.) and the additional effect of being \"labeled\" according to stream, make the application of this model difficult. Unfortunately, this model cannot be tested in this study. Since students are streamed according to ability, there is virtually no overlap in abilities in the different streams, and we have no measure of achievement by students within each ho the ecademic streams. However, to the extent that this process does operate, it will lower academic self-concept/ability correlations.",
