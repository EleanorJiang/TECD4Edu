Extending the I/E model, Dimensional Comparison Theory (DCT) posits that self-evaluations are based on dimensional comparisons (e.g., how my accomplishments in one domain compare with my accomplishments in another domain) as well as the more traditional social and temporal comparisons, and on other sources of information about one's accomplishments. Extending the traditional tests of the I/E model, DCT predicts strong contrast effects only for contrasting domains that are at the opposite ends of the theoretical continuum of academic self-concept (far comparisons: e.g., the negative effect of math achievement on verbal self-concept), but much weaker negative contrast or even positive assimilation effects for complementary domains that are close to each other (near domains: e.g., positive effects of math achievement on physics self-concept; positive effects of native language on foreign language self-concept). Here we illustrate new predictions, theoretical insights, and methodology associated with DCT based on multiple academic domains (native language, foreign language, history, biology, physics and math), showing significant contrast effects for far comparisons and significantly less contrast or assimilation effects for near domains.",

Particularly in education settings, a positive academic self-concept (ASC) is both a highly desirable goal and a means of facilitating subsequent academic achievement, academic accomplishments, and educational choice behaviors, including subject choice, coursework selection, academic persistence, and long-term educational attainment (e.g., Chen, Yeh, Hwang, & Lin, 2013; Guay, Larose, & Boivin, 2004; Marsh, 1991 Marsh, , 2007 Marsh & Craven, 2006; Pinxten, De Fraine, Van Damme, & D'Haenens, 2010) . Thus, Marsh and Yeung (1997; also see Parker et al., 2012) found that ASCs predicted future coursework selection better than corresponding measures of academic achievement, whilst O'Mara (2008, 2010) found that ASCs predicted long-term educational attainment five years after high school graduation better than school grades, IQ, standardized tests, or socio-economic status.",

                "text": "In the last 30 years self-concept research has experienced dramatic growth in the quality of measurement instruments, theoretical models, quantitative methodology, and research design. The cornerstone of this resurgence is the classic review article by Shavelson, Hubner, and Stanton (1976) , who posited self-concept as a multidimensional, hierarchical construct, where different facets of academic self-concept are substantially correlated and form a single higher-order academic self-concept factor. This is consistent with the positive relations routinely observed among achievements in different school subjects (Marsh, 2007) . However, subsequent research revealed that mathematics self-concept and verbal selfconcept in particular were nearly uncorrelated; this led to the Marsh/Shavelson revision (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) . Marsh and Shavelson posited two higher-order academic self-concept factors (mathematics/academic and verbal/academic), a continuum of core academic self-concept factors ranging from verbal self-concept at one end to math self-concept at the other end, and an ordering of academic self-concepts in other domains along this continuum. This perspective has resulted in increased attention to frame of reference effects based on dimensional comparisons, which are the focus of the present investigation.",

                "text": "Since at least the time of William James (1890 /1963 , psychologists have realized that self-concepts are based in part on evaluations of objective achievements in relation to frames of reference. Depending on the frame of reference, or the standard of comparison against which individuals evaluate themselves, the same objective accomplishment can lead to quite different self-concepts. Self-concepts have important consequences for future choices, for behavior and performance. In the broader psychological literature, the two most frequently posited frames of reference are social and temporal comparisons (Albert, 1977; Festinger, 1954; M\u20ac oller, 2005; M\u20ac oller, Pohlmann, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2009; M\u20ac oller, Retelsdorf, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2011) ; self-concepts are based in part on how our current accomplishments compare with past performances (temporal comparisons) and on how they compare with the accomplishments of others within the current context (social comparisons; e.g., classmates in one's school or class). However, as emphasized by M\u20ac oller and Marsh (2013, p. 1) in their empirical and theoretical foundation for dimensional comparison theory (DCT): \"In addition to social comparisons (Festinger, 1954) and temporal comparisons (Albert, 1977) , dimensional comparisons are presented as a largely neglected but influential process in self-evaluation.\" M\u20ac oller and stress that the internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model that forms the theoretical and empirical basis of the DCT has been studied widely only in educational settings, and mostly in relation to the math and verbal domains. DCT (Marsh et al., in press; M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) incorporates an extensive body of educational research based on the I/E model, placing dimensional comparisons into a broader theoretical foundation, in relation to more general psychological models of selfevaluation, person perception, frames of reference, and social comparison. Hence, the overarching purpose of the present investigation is to provide new empirical support for the extension of the I/E model into DCT.",

Tests of the I/E model typically are conducted by regressing math self-concept and verbal self-concept on math and verbal achievements (see Fig. 1A ). The external comparison process predicts that good math skills lead to higher math self-concepts and that good verbal skills lead to higher verbal self-concepts. According to the internal dimensional comparison process, however, good math skills lead to lower verbal self-concepts, once the positive effects of good verbal skills are controlled: The better I am at mathematics, the poorer I am at verbal subjects, relative to my good math skills. Similarly, better verbal skills lead to lower math self-concepts once the positive effects of good math skills are controlled. In models used to test these predictions (see Fig. 1A ), the horizontal (matching) paths leading from math achievement to math selfconcept and from verbal achievement to verbal self-concept are predicted to be substantially positive. However, the cross-paths leading from math achievement to verbal self-concept and from verbal achievement to math self-concept (the gray lines in Fig. 1A ) are predicted to be negative.",

(2009; also see Marsh, 2007; M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) note that evidence in favor of this model for math and verbal domains comes from diverse sources and experimental designs. Marsh (1986) first proposed the I/E model based on results from 13 studies of the relations between math and verbal achievements and ASCs in the corresponding domains. Although there were consistently high correlations between math and verbal achievements (.42e.94), there were weak or even negative correlations between math self-concepts and verbal self-concepts (\u00c0.10 to .19). In the I/E path diagram ( Fig. 1A) , the (horizontal) paths from math achievement to math selfconcept and from verbal achievement to verbal self-concept were substantial and positive. However, the cross-paths ( Fig. 1A ) from math achievement to verbal self-concept and from verbal achievement to math self-concept were significant and negative. In a large cross-cultural study, Marsh and Hau (2004; also see Marsh, Hau, Artelt, Baumert, & Peschar, 2006) demonstrated that support for these predictions generalized over large, nationally representative samples of 15-year-olds from 26 countries. In a meta-analysis of 69 datasets M\u20ac oller et al. (2009) reported that math and verbal achievements were highly correlated (.67), but that self-concepts were nearly uncorrelated (.10). The horizontal paths from achievement to ASC in the matching domains were positive (.61 for math, .49 for verbal), but cross-paths were negative from math achievement to verbal self-concept (\u00c0.21) and verbal achievement to math self-concept (\u00c0.27). Thus, strong support for the classical I/E predictions in relation to the math and verbal domains, generalizes over different measures of achievement, over self-concept instruments, and over age, gender, and country.",

They experimentally manipulated the external (social) comparison process, based on performance feedback relative to other students, and the dimensional comparison process, based on feedback relative to performance by the same student on achievement from two subject-specific tasks. They showed how experimentally manipulating feedback on achievement in one subject area has an inverse effect on self-concept in a different school subject. M\u20ac oller and K\u20ac oller (2001a) concluded that \"as shown experimentally for the first time, dimensional comparison information can have inverse effects on task-related cognitions in other domains\" (p. 833). Extending empirical tests of the I/E model, they showed support both for an external comparison process (based on experimentally manipulated feedback about achievement compared to other students) and an internal comparison process (based on experimentally manipulated feedback about one's own performance in one area relative to performance in another area).

Similarly, Eccles and colleagues (Eccles, Vida, & Barber, 2004; Nagy et al., 2008; Parker et al., 2012) integrated support for I/E predictions into expectancy-value theory for the prediction of gender differences in academic and career choice.

The 'Classic' Internal/External Frame of Reference (I/E) Model relating verbal and math achievement to verbal and math self-concept. According to predictions from the I/ E model, the horizontal paths from achievement to self-concept in the matching domains (content area) are predicted to be substantial and positive, whereas the cross-paths from achievement in one domain area to self-concept in a non-matching domain are predicted to be negative (contrast). (B). Extending the I/E model to include the verbal domain, one or more verbally-related domains, the math domain, and one or more math-related domains. Far cross-paths (any of the math domains to any of the verbal domains) are again predicted to be negative. However, the near cross-paths (relating different verbal domains to each other, or different math domains to each other) are predicted to be significantly less negative, non-significant, or even positive (assimilation).

Thus, M\u20ac oller et al. (2009) called for an extension of the I/E model to other academic domains, asking, for example, whether: students see physics and mathematics as sufficiently distinct that better performances in one would lead to poorer self-concepts in the other (a contrast effect like that posited in the I/E model based on the mathematics and verbal domains), or would the two be seen as sufficiently similar so that better performance in one would lead to better self-concepts in the other (an assimilation effect)?

The theoretical and empirical underpinning of the extension of the I/E model into DCT is based on an a priori verbal-to-math continuum of academic domains (Fig. 2) . Theoretically, the continuum follows from the Marsh/Shavelson revision (Marsh, 1990a (Marsh, , 1990b Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) of the original Shavelson et al. (1976) multidimensional, hierarchical model of self-concept (see Marsh, 2007) . Empirical support for the continuum is based on a higher-order factor analysis in which there are two higher-order factors (math and verbal self-concept) defined by lower-order self-concept factors, such that the similarity between different academic domains is operationalized as correlations among the different domains (Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988) .",

The classic I/E model ( Fig. 1A) is based on only math and verbal domains, so that there are only \"horizontal\" paths between matching domains and \"cross\" paths between nonmatching domains. The important contribution of DCT is to expand the scope of the theoretical perspective to include a wider variety of domains, in which the cross-paths involve \"near\" and \"far\" comparisons in relation to how similar or dissimilar different school subjects are to each other. A key feature of the expansion of the I/E model into DCT is to highlight this distinction between near and far comparisons, to test the a priori prediction that contrast effects based on \"near\" comparisons will be substantially less negative and may even be positive rather than negative (i.e., assimilation effects). Hence, similar subjects (e.g., native and foreign languages, or math and physics) might be seen as complementary, rather than contrasting, such that achievement in one domain contributes positively to self-concept in a complementary, near domain. The present investigation provides the first strong test of the extension of the I/E model into DCT, stronger in terms of the DCT theoretical basis, the range of different school subjects considered, and the statistical methods used.",

In the evaluation of predictions for near, far and matching domains, we relied heavily on the flexibility of the \"model constraint\" function in Mplus, and the resulting tests of statistical significance based on these model constraints. In particular, we used these constraints to compare the mean of matching, near, and far paths across the five school subjects in relation to a priori predictions. In each of the models considered here, we included all variables, noting that a model with all variables simply correlated is equivalent (in terms of df and goodness of fit) to a model in which some of the correlations are represented as path coefficients. Thus for example, in a preliminary model based on the classic I/E model ( Fig. 2) , relations among German and math constructs were presented by appropriate path coefficients, whereas all other relations were represented as correlations. In the subsequent extended DCT model, involving all five domains, additional correlations were represented by appropriate paths in the SEM. Similarly, the set of control covariates was included in all models. However, for models that did not control for these effects, relations between covariates and other constructs were simply represented as correlations, whereas models designed to control for these covariates included these relations as paths in the SEM. Using this approach, all the different models incorporated the same variables and were equivalent in terms of df and goodness of fit. This strategy had important advantages for the comparison of models based on different sets of variables that potentially confound aspects of the measurement and structural models. This evolving methodologydcombining the flexibility typically associated with analyses of manifest variables with the rigor of latent-variable modelsdis apparently a new contribution of the present investigation (see Supplemental Materials).",

A critical feature of these data is that five sets of three selfconcept items with parallel wording were used to measure each self-concept factor. Consistent with expectations, the CFA model with no control for parallel worded items was highly unsatisfactory in terms of goodness of fit, but when item method factors were included in the model, to account for parallel item wording effects, the fit was much better (Supplemental Materials Table 1) . Finally, in model M3, we found strong support for the invariance of factor loadings of parallel items across the five domains. Although support for the invariance of factor loadings across the five selfconcept domains is not essential for the present purposes, it facilitates interpretation of results in a substantially more parsimonious model (i.e., with fewer estimated parameters).",

In support of their discriminant validity, correlations between each ASC factor and non-matching areas of achievement were substantially smaller (rs vary from .096 to .322; Table 1) than the convergent validities. Consistent with previous research, correlations among the ASC factors (rs varying from .021 to .344) were systematically smaller than correlations among the five corresponding achievement measures (rs varying from .423 to .566). Consistent with the ordering of the self-concept factors along a verbal-math continuum, the correlation between math and German self-concept was close to zero (r \u00bc .021), and was the smallest of any correlation among these factors. Indeed, the three smallest correlations among ASC factors were for relations of math with German (.021), English (.085), and a second (nonnative) foreign language (.041).

In particular, the path coefficients for the two domains common to each model (German and math) were very similar. Hence, the larger mean matching paths in the extended model are due to large matching paths particularly for English (.787) and for second foreign language (.733). Similarly, the less negative mean far comparison in the extended model is due to the inclusion of new domains. In particular, the posited negative effect of biology achievement was non-significant for German self-concept (.013, SE \u00bc .044) and English self-concept (\u00c0.010, SE \u00bc .037), but was significant for selfconcept in the second foreign language (\u00c0.107, SE \u00bc .040). Similarly, the effects of German and English achievement were not significant for biology self-concept (\u00c0.024, SE \u00bc .036; -.046, SE \u00bc .037 respectively), whilst the effect of second foreign language achievement on biology was significantly negative (\u00c0.117, SE \u00bc .045). This is also consistent with the earlier discussion of correlations among self-concept factors (Table 1) , showing that biology self-concept is as highly related to German self-concept as it is to math self-concept (rs \u00bc .258 and .257, respectively), and that biology self-concept is more highly related to German and English achievements (rs \u00bc .243 and .242, respectively) than to math achievement (.194 ). These observations suggest, perhaps, that the classification of biology as a more math/science-like domain might be unwarranteddor at least that biology is no more complementary in relation to math than it is to verbal subjects (see subsequent, related discussion of Study 2, which includes physics as well as math and biology).",

First, the set of academic domains was extended to include six subjects, including three that are classified as more math/science like (math, physics, biology) and three that are classified as more verbal like (German, English, History). The inclusion of physics provided a potentially important addition in that the results of Study 1 suggest that biology is seen as being as similar to verbal domains as it is to math domains, whilst previous research (e.g., Goetz, Cronjaeger, Frenzel, L\u00fcdtke, & Hall, 2010; M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) suggests that math and physics are more likely to be complementary. Also, the addition of history is a potentially interesting addition in that, whilst it is classified as more verbal-like, it is clearly neither a purely verbal subject nor a math/science subject, but falls near the center of the mathverbal continuum.

As emphasized by many researchers (e.g., Bong & Skaalvik, 2003 ) both self-concept and self-efficacy are similar in their emphasis on perceived competence, in having a multidimensional and hierarchical structure and in prediction of future performance and choice. Historically it has been argued that selfconcept is a global measure, whilst self-efficacy is more domain specific. However, particularly in educational settings, current approaches to self-concept typically focus on its domain specificity, whilst some researchers argue for the usefulness of global measures of self-efficacy (Chen, Gully, & Eden, 2001; Jerusalem & Schwarzer, 1992; Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995; Skinner, Chapman, & Baltes, 1988 ; also see Bandura, 2006a Bandura, , 2006b . Importantly, research clearly suggests that domain specific measures of self-efficacy and self-concept are more strongly correlated with criterion variables than are domain general versions of the same measure (Pajares & Schunk, 2005) .

Thus, self-efficacy items typically are criterion-referenced and assess students' confidence in being able to solve specific problems similar to the actual test items (Marsh, Roche, Pajares, & Miller, 1997; Pajares & Schunk, 2005) , or self-perceptions of their capability to successfully undertake the actions required to complete a specific task (e.g., \"I would be able to calculate the area of a room in square meters\"; Ferla, Valcke, & Cai, 2009) .",

Because self-concept items typically do not contain a specific criterion-reference, students have to rely on other frames of reference, like the social and dimensional comparison processes posited in the I/E model. On this theoretical basis, Marsh (1993) argued that frame-of-reference effects are directly implicated in ASC responses, as individuals use the social and dimensional comparison processes to establish frames of reference for evaluating their own performances. Making a similar point, Bong and Skaalvik (2003) argued that \"assessing one's capability in academic self-concept relies heavily on social comparison information,\" whereas \"self-efficacy items solicit goal referenced evaluations and do not directly ask students to compare their abilities to those of others,\" and \"provide respondents with a specific description of required performance as a referent against which to appraise their competence\" (p. 9). Similarly, Bandura (1986) emphasized that self-esteem and self-conceptd but not selfefficacyd are partly determined by \"how well one's behavior matches personal standards of worthiness\" (p. 410). However, Marsh et al. (1991) argued that the self-perceived worthiness of performance expectations in relation to personal and external standards is critical in motivating and sustaining performance. Ignoring the selfevaluative component of self-beliefs is likely to greatly reduce the power of self-beliefs in motivating students and predicting future choice behaviors and educational outcomes.",

Thus, students were presented with actual items from an achievement test and asked how likely it was they would be able to solve this item if it were presented in a test. They were then presented with a test based on the same or similar items, to assess self-efficacy (see Marsh et al., 1991; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1990; . Not surprisingly, particularly when both self-efficacy and test items were identical, self-efficacy responses were highly correlated with test scores. Of particular relevance is an early test of the I/E model by Skaalvik and Rankin (1990) , who were not able to replicate support for the I/E predictions. However, Marsh et al. (1991) demonstrated that the failure to replicate was based on self-efficacy rather than on self-concept responses. They showed, in a study based on students who completed both instruments, that I/E predictions were supported for ASC responses, but not for self-efficacyda finding subsequently replicated by Skaalvik and Rankin (1995) .",

For example, in judging the likelihood of correctly answering a test item on a math test, students have little need to compare their performance in one subject with their performance in other subjects such as English (internal, dimensional comparison) or with the performances of other students in mathematics (external, social comparison). Furthermore, a response of 80% likelihood of successfully answering a particular math problem does not indicate whether the student considers this to be a good or bad outcome in relation to internal or external frames of reference; this potentially undermines its usefulness in predicting future behavior. Based on these findings, Marsh et al. hypothesized that self-concept responses should be effective at predicting future choice behavior, and proposed the selection of specific school subjects as a particularly relevant area in which to evaluate these predictions. In support of these suggestions, Skaalvik and Rankin (1995) found that math and verbal self-concepts influenced corresponding measures of intrinsic motivation, effort, and anxiety, whereas math and verbal self-efficacy responses did not.",

Importantly, they compared how achievement is related to self-efficacy and selfconcept, but found no statistically significant difference between relations based on these two self-belief constructs. However, particularly pertinent to the present investigation, most of the studies in both these meta-analyses were based on either selfefficacy or on self-concept, but did not directly compare results based on both constructs in the same study. Consequently, it is not clear whether these differences are due to confounding with the many other differences between studies based on each of these constructs. 7.1.3. Self-concept and self-efficacy responses: jingle-jangle fallacies Marsh et al. (2003) argued that support for predictions based on a priori distinctions between self-concept and self-efficacy responses is highly dependent upon the precise nature of the selfefficacy items. In particular, many so-called self-efficacy items are nearly indistinguishable from traditional self-concept items, in relation to the critical distinctions emphasized here (Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, & K\u20ac oller, 2008) . Where explicit criteria of success are not provided as part of the item, this forces students to use additional standards to answer the item, such as the social and dimensional comparison processes that are the basis of DCT. Thus, some measures purporting to assess self-efficacy are based on stimuli likely to invoke social and dimensional comparison processes (e.g., \"I'm certain I can do an excellent job on assignments and tests,\" where the term excellent might imply a comparison with the work of other students or, perhaps, the student's own performance in other school subjects). Indeed, particularly in relation to more global measures of self-efficacy, it is unclear whether the inclusion of explicit criteria of success is possible or even appropriate, further blurring the distinction between self-concept and self-efficacy. In summary, consistent with jingle-jangle fallacies, the empirically demonstrated distinction between self-concept and self-efficacy responses is likely to depend on the nature and wording of the items, rather than on the label assigned to the construct.",

Thus, selfconcept responses will be better differentiated than the corresponding self-efficacy responses in relation to correlations among domains within each construct and in relation to achievement. For models with only math and verbal domains, support for the generalizability of the I/E predictions would require substantially positive paths from achievement to self-concept for matching domains and negative (contrast) cross-paths for nonmatching domains. Nevertheless, both the positive matching and the negative cross-paths are expected to be substantially smaller for self-efficacy responses. Indeed, Marsh et al.'s (1991) results suggest that cross-paths for self-efficacy might show little or no contextual effects at all. When additional school subjects are added to the model, support for the generalizability of the I/E predictions would still require cross-paths relating achievement to self-concept to be significantly negative (contrast effect) for far domains (math with English and German). However, the new DCT predictions would require cross-paths relating achievement to self-concept to achievement in near domains (e.g., math with physics) be significantly less neative (less contrast) or even positive (assimilation). Because there is neither a theoretical nor an empirical basis for predictions based on near paths in selfefficacy responses, we leave this as a research question.",

Indeed, a critical source of self-knowledge is knowing one's relative strengths and weaknesses in different domains as a basis of academic choices, accurate self-evaluation, self-improvement, self-maintenance, and self-enhancement. The classic I/E model focuses primarily on how math and verbal achievements are related to math self-concept and verbal self-concept (Fig. 1A) . As shown by an impressive array of correlational, longitudinal, crosscultural, experimental, and qualitative studies, better math achievement leads to lower verbal self-concept and the better verbal achievement leads to lower math self-conceptdthe critical, seemingly paradoxical prediction of the I/E model.

In the broader social comparison literature, these negative effects are referred to as contrast effects (see M\u20ac oller . DCT posits that the negative (contrast) effects will diminish and may even become positive (assimilation) effects when dimensional comparisons are based on complementary domains that are close together on the academic continuum. Here we operationalized this extension and developed new statistical tests to evaluate these predictions. This article is the first test of DCT theoretical predictions based on a comprehensive range of academic domains.

Critically, there was little or no support for I/E predictions based on selfefficacy responses, whilst support for the predictions based on selfconcept responses continued to grow. Also of relevance, there was a near-zero correlation between math and verbal ASC responses, but a substantial positive correlation between math and verbal self-efficacy responses.

We suspect that the construction of items is the critical issue, and note that the typical self-efficacy items do not meet these rigid standards.

Fortunately, there is now a growing body of I/E studies, using various combinations of qualitative introspection studies, longitudinal, quasi-experimental, and true experimental designs with random assignment of students, which support the I/E model (see earlier discussion). However, there is a need for further research along these lines to support the causal interpretation of new theoretical predictions based on DCTdparticularly in relation to the distinction between matching, near, and far comparisons, but also in relations to the conditions under which near comparisons are likely to result in assimilation rather than contrast.",

However, we do note that our a priori predictions were that negative cross-paths would be significantly less negative (less contrast) or even positive (assimilation), and support for these predictions was highly consistent across both studies. Furthermore, in the research literature on social comparison effects, support for assimilation effects is also inconsistent (Diener & Fujita, 1997; Marsh, Seaton, et al. 2008; Marsh, Seaton, et al., 2010) . Clearly, DCT predicts that assimilation is more likely for maximally near comparisons (e.g., math and physics) than far comparisons (e.g., math and verbal domains) and more likely for near comparisons that are based on two domains very close to each other on the academic continuum (e.g., math and physics compared to math and biology). In addition to these DCT we speculate that contextual or situations features might influence the results. Thus, if math and physics are taught as a unified subject, reinforcing their mutual dependence, then assimilation might be more likely. Also, if we asked students to directly rate the perceived similarity of different academic domains, assimilation might be more likely for students who perceived a given pair of domains to be more similar. These ratings of perceived similarity could be used to validate the continuum but also provide more nuanced tests of DCT predictions such that the perceived \"nearness\" or \"farness\" of different domains might influence the size of the observed relations over and above the more objective positioning of constructs on the continuum. Because DCT is relatively new, particularly these speculations about assimilation offer an exciting direction for further research.",
