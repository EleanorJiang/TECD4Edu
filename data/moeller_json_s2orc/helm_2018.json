                "text": "Positive self-concepts are important for students' social and emotional development (Kagan, Moore, & Bredekamp, 1995) . As academic self-concepts moreover influence motivation and effort in various domains (Eccles, O'Neill, & Wigfield, 2005) , they are seen as a major factor influencing subsequent learning (e.g., Marsh & Craven, 2006; M\u00f6ller, Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2011; Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & M\u00f6ller, 2014; Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004) . Promotion of domain-specific academic self-concepts thus is a central research topic in educational psychology, a major objective for effective schooling (Brookover & Lezotte, 1979) and, accordingly, a central task for teachers. If achievement suffers, teachers should be able to identify the correct reason for this decreased achievement, which might be a decrease in self-concept. Based on their correct diagnosis, teachers will then be able to take appropriate measures to support students in developing a more positive self-concept and to subsequently improve their achievement (Spinath, 2005) . Thus, as it constitutes a factor preceding the promotion of students' self-concepts, teachers' ability to correctly judge students' evaluations of their own abilities has also gotten into the focus of research in recent years. It seems to be more difficult for teachers to adequately assess students' academic self-concepts than to assess students' abilities (Kaiser, Retelsdorf, S\u00fcdkamp, & M\u00f6ller, 2013; Spinath, 2005) . Moreover, when estimating students' mathematical and verbal self-concepts, teachers seem to miss one central process that students themselves carry out when forming their self-concepts in these areas: contrastive dimensional comparison. Therefore, the present studies aim at analyzing teachers' judgment accuracy regarding students' mathematical and verbal self-concepts to reveal whether teachers' judgment accuracy is affected by information teachers have about students' achievements in the two areas. It is assumed that informed teachers will use students' achievements more strongly to derive self-concepts from these achievements, leading to stronger hints on social comparisons (Festinger, 1954) , and, centrally, on contrastive dimensional comparisons (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) in their estimations of students' selfconcepts. Hence, the present studies provide a contribution to research about teacher judgment accuracy, as they assess teachers' judgment accuracy in the estimation of students' mathematical and verbal selfconcepts. Moreover, they pose the question whether judgment accuracy can be increased by providing teachers with the possibility to carry out social and especially dimensional comparisons that students themselves draw when forming their subject-specific self-concepts. On the other hand, the present studies provide relevant findings for dimensional comparison theory (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) , as they examine whether hints on dimensional comparisons can be found when teachers are asked to assess students' self-concepts, and, whether the effects hinting https://doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2018.02.002 Received 22 May 2017; Received in revised form 1 February 2018; Accepted 5 February 2018 on dimensional comparisons can be influenced by informing teachers about students' achievements in the two subjects judged. In the next paragraphs, firstly, the state of research on teachers' diagnostic accuracy with regard to students' academic ability self-concepts is depicted, secondly, research on social and dimensional comparisons in the formation of students' self-concepts is outlined, and thirdly, findings on possible social and dimensional comparisons in the formation of teachers' inferences of students' self-concepts are presented.",

                "text": "1.1. Teachers' judgment accuracy regarding students' self-concepts Teachers' ability to accurately judge their students with regard to various characteristics is considered an important precondition for the adequate planning and implementation of instruction in school (S\u00fcdkamp, Kaiser, & M\u00f6ller, 2012) . The average judgment accuracy regarding student achievement is good, as the meta-analysis by S\u00fcdkamp et al. (2012) indicates (mean correlation between teacher judgment and student achievement: r = .63). Besides teachers' ability to judge students' achievement accurately, teachers' diagnostic accuracy regarding other student characteristics, like student anxiety, motivation, and self-concept, has been the object of several studies (e.g., Givvin, Stipek, Salmon, & MacGyvers, 2001; Kaiser et al., 2013; Spinath, 2005) . It shows that teachers' ability to judge these aspects generally is lower than their ability to judge students' achievements: For example, Spinath (2005) found teachers' judgments regarding students' learning motivation and school anxiety to be correlated with students' actual motivation and anxiety to a rather low degree (r = .20 and r = .15). Studies examining teacher judgment accuracy concerning students' self-concepts mostly show low to moderate correlations between students' self-concepts and teachers' inferences: Spinath (2005) found a moderate correlation (r = .39) between students' self-concept and teacher judgments of students' self-concepts in primary schools. Similar results were obtained by Marsh, Smith, and Barnes (1984) , for reading (r = .34) and mathematics (r = .29) (see also Marsh, Parker, & Smith, 1983) . Pohlmann, M\u00f6ller, and Streblow (2004) assessed mathematics teachers' inferences of their students' mathematics and German self-concepts. As expected, correspondence between teachers' inferences and students' self-concepts was higher for mathematics (r = .49) than for German (r = .10). Marsh and Craven (1991) found positive moderate to average correlations between primary teachers' inferences and students' self-concepts at two points in time during a school year (for reading at time 1: r = .39, at time 2: r = .50; for mathematics at time 1: r = .47, at time 2: r = .52). Similar, but on average slightly higher correlations were obtained between students' self-concepts and self-concepts inferred by their parents (rs = .46-.60). This finding is cautiously explained by Marsh and Craven (1991) with parents being likely to talk more often about their children's school experiences, achievements and school-related feelings with their children than teachers do with their students. Therefore, parents might take the obtained information into account very strongly when inferring their children's self-concepts. They might also consider their children's feelings and experiences in different subjects, when estimating their children's self-concepts (see Van Zanden et al., 2017) , whereas teachers might base their estimates of students' self-concepts on students' achievements in the subject they teach to a bigger amount.",

This difference may partly be caused by the fact that teachers frequently measure students' achievements with relatively objective achievement measures like exams, hence receiving a more or less clear picture of students' strengths and difficulties with regard to ability and achievement. In contrast, it is harder to judge students' selfconcepts accurately. One reason may be that teachers, as proposed by Marsh and Craven (1991) , mainly base their inferences on students' achievement in the regarding domain, because this achievement is the most accessible information for them. In doing so, teachers might fail to consider certain central processes students themselves use while forming their academic self-concepts: For example, teachers might not consider students' achievements in other subjects and domains, and therefore might miss a central process that students themselves carry out when forming their self-concepts: contrastive dimensional comparison. The exact information on which teachers base their judgments on students' self-concepts has not yet been exhaustively explored. The present study aims to contribute to the closure of this research gap.",

Social comparisons comprise a comparison of the student's own achievements in a domain (mathematical or verbal) with other students' achievements in the regarding domain. The effects of social comparisons are expressed in positive achievement-self-concept relationsstudents with better-off grades develop higher selfconcepts within the domain. Dimensional comparisons are comparisons of students' own achievement in a domain (mathematical or verbal) with their own achievement in another domain (verbal or mathematical). Effects of dimensional comparisons are expressed in negative achievement-self-concept relations across domains: A student with better achievement in the mathematical domain will develop a worse self-concept in the verbal domain, compared to a student with equal verbal but worse mathematics achievement. Both effects, those of social and those of dimensional comparisons, are considered in the internal/ external frame of reference model (I/E model; Marsh, 1986) : Social comparisons lead to positive effects of achievements on self-concepts in the corresponding domain, whereas dimensional comparisons lead to negative effects of achievements on self-concepts in the non-corresponding domain. Fig. 1 depicts the meta-analytic findings by M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, K\u00f6ller, and Marsh (2009) on the relations between achievements and self-concepts in the mathematical and the verbal area across 69 studies from different countries and with different student age groups. It can be noted that the positive effects of social comparisons exceed the negative effects of dimensional comparisons.",

Considering the significance of these two comparison processes for students' self-evaluation, the question arises whether teachers comprehend and consider these processes when inferring their students' self-concepts. For parents, Van Zanden et al. (2017) were able to show hints on social and contrastive dimensional comparisons in their inferences of their children's self-concepts. Considering teachers, to date, two field studies explicitly tested the I/E model for teachers' inferences of students' self-concepts. In a path-analytic study, Marsh et al. (1984) found positive effects of achievement (objective test scores and teacher ratings of students' achievement) in the mathematical and in the verbal area on teacherinferred self-concepts in the corresponding area. Hence, they found effects equaling those of social comparisons students draw themselves. Yet, they also found positive effects of achievement on inferred selfconcept in the non-corresponding area (with the exception of a nonsignificant effect of teacher-judged mathematics achievement on inferred verbal self-concept). Thus, there were no effects hinting on contrastive dimensional comparisons as they had found for students' self-inferred self-concepts, but rather assimilative effects. These effects are considered positive effects of achievement on self-concept in the non-corresponding subject (e.g., M\u00f6ller, Helm, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, Nagy, & Marsh, 2015) . In the formation of students' self-concepts, assimilative effects are found mostly for dimensional comparisons between subjects from the same domain (especially within the math/science domain; e.g., Schilling, Sparfeldt, & Rost, 2004) . Marsh et al. (1984) conclude that the positive social comparison effect, but not the contrastive dimensional comparison effect is predictive of inferred self-concepts by teachers. In a second path-analytic study, Pohlmann et al. (2004) assessed students' mathematics and verbal (German) self-concepts and inferred self-concepts by the mathematics teacher. They found positive effects of achievement on teachers' judgments of students' self-concepts within the domains. For dimensional comparisons, one positive effect of mathematics achievement (hence, achievement in the subject the teachers taught) on inferred German self-concept showed for teacher ratings. The effect of German achievement on inferred mathematics selfconcept was non-significant. Thus, according to this study as well, teachers generally seem to consider social comparisons when trying to evaluate their students' self-concepts. Dimensional comparisons, if not ignored at all, mostly seem to be carried out in an assimilative manner, that is, teachers derive a better verbal (mathematics) self-concept from a better mathematics (verbal) achievement and do not seem to contrast mathematical and verbal abilities in the estimation of students' selfconcepts like students themselves do.",

In an experimental study, Dickh\u00e4user (2005) argues that the contrastive effects of dimensional comparisons are absent in teacher-inferred self-concepts because teachers do not have enough information to draw these comparisons. He states that most teachers only teach either mathematics or the native language. Therefore, a majority of the teachers may not be aware of a student's achievements in both mathematics and in the native language subject and hence do not to take the dimensional comparison process into account at all when inferring students' subject-specific self-concepts. Participants (teacher training students) in Dickh\u00e4user's study (2005) were informed about students' achievements in both subjects: They received qualitative school reports including information about a fictitious student's achievements in mathematics and German. While holding verbal achievement stable, teacher-inferred verbal self-concept was higher when the student had been presented as achieving poorly in mathematics than when he/she had been presented as achieving well in mathematics. M\u00fcller-Kalthoff et al. (2017, Studies 2 and 3) were able to replicate these findings using quantitative achievement indicators (grades) compared to qualitative achievement information. Hence, participants in all three experimental studies, informed about fictitious students' achievements in both subjects, seem to have drawn contrastive dimensional comparisons.",

In contrast, the three experimental studies explicitly informing participants (teacher training students) about student achievement in both subjects found contrastive dimensional comparison effects for teachers' inferences (Dickh\u00e4user, 2005; M\u00fcller-Kalthoff et al., 2017) . Based on the existing research, it can be concluded that teachers may indeed need to be given information about the regarding achievements for effects hinting on contrastive dimensional comparisons to show. Although teachers in the study by Marsh et al. (1984) were Australian primary school teachers who were likely to teach multiple subjects, neither Marsh et al. (1984) nor Pohlmann et al. (2004) controlled for whether teachers indeed were informed about their students' achievements in both subjects. Therefore, it is still unclear whether teachers are able to consider similar judgment processes (like social and dimensional comparisons) when inferring their students' self-concepts as students themselves do, and how this capacity is related to the knowledge that teachers have about students' achievements. Increasing knowledge might improve teachers' judgment accuracy when judging students' selfconcepts.",

These comparisons lead to ability selfconcepts in the two domains that differ to a greater amount than achievements in both domains actually differ. A relevant research question regarding teachers' ability to judge their students' academic self-concepts is whether teachers also show hints on contrastive dimensional comparisons in their inferences of students' self-concepts. Doing so should support their ability to accurately judge their students' self-concepts. A small number of research studies so far were concerned with the question regarding contrastive dimensional comparisons in teachers' inferences of their students' self-concepts. The outlined field studies examining practicing teachers did not find hints on contrastive dimensional comparisons in teachers' self-concept inferences. The experimental studies examining teacher training students and informing participants about students' grades in both subjects found contrastive dimensional comparison effects. Hence, the existing studies on the question of contrastive dimensional comparisons in teachers self-concept inferences provide a heterogeneous picture. The present research addresses the outlined research gap. In two studies, we examine teachers' judgments of their students' self-concepts in mathematics and German, considering the conclusion drawn from the outlined experimental studies that teachers need to be explicitly informed about students' achievements in both domains to have the possibility to carry out contrastive dimensional comparisons themselves while empathizing with their students in the process of judging students' self-concepts. Moreover, information about achievements should enable teachers to consider these achievements more strongly in the estimation of a student's self-concept in the corresponding domain. These research questions concerning the I/E model are connected to research on teacher judgment accuracy.",

Yet, at least the result that mathematics teachers did not profit from information about grades in the estimation of students' German selfconcepts could be explained by teachers with information about grades in both subjects using this information in the wrong way to infer self-concept in the non-corresponding domain. The Dimensional Comparison Hypothesis, which assumed that informed teachers show stronger effects hinting on contrastive dimensional comparisons than uninformed teachers, could not be confirmed. Rather, informed teachers showed a positive effect of mathematics achievement on inferred German self-concept. Informed teachers thus did not carry out the contrastive dimensional comparison processes their students draw, but seem to have drawn an assimilative comparison, deriving a more positive German self-concept from a more positive mathematics achievement. Thus, the positive effect of mathematics achievement on German self-concept for informed teachers may be a reason for the finding that judgment accuracy regarding students' German self-concept in this teacher group was not higher than for uninformed teachers. On the contrary, information about the German grade was not used at all by informed teachers to infer mathematics self-concept. It may be that mathematics teachers consider achievement in their own subject more important for the derivation of self-concepts in other subjects than they consider achievement in German. As well, it may be that teachers in general consider mathematics to be a central subject and thus mathematics achievement to take an influence on self-concepts in other subjects as well.",

Existing empirical field research argues against teachers drawing contrastive dimensional comparisons when forming an impression of their students' self-concepts (Marsh et al., 1984; Pohlmann et al., 2004 ). Yet, the existing field studies did not examine whether teachers had information about students' achievements in both subjects they had to give their estimations for. Thus, in the present studies, following the results and the argumentation by Dickh\u00e4user (2005) , we reasoned that teachers need to be informed about students' grades in both subjects to be able to consider them as dimensional comparison information and as well to consider them more strongly as social comparison information. Firstly, teachers informed and not informed about students' grades generally showed a diagnostic accuracy in the estimation of students' self-concepts, which is similar to or slightly higher than in previous studies (Marsh & Craven, 1991; Marsh et al., 1984; Pohlmann et al., 2004) . Testing the assumption that informed teachers would show a higher diagnostic accuracy in estimating students' self-concepts showed that informed teachers were not able to estimate students' mathematics self-concepts more correctly than uninformed teachers, and this was the case for mathematics as well as for German teachers. Descriptively, a higher judgment accuracy showed for informed teachers in the estimation of students' mathematics self-concepts and for mathematics teachers as well in the estimation of students' German self-concepts. Yet, the differences in judgment accuracy did not reach statistical significance. For German teachers, information about students' grades even deteriorated teachers' judgment accuracy regarding students' German self-concepts, although again the difference in judgment accuracy did not reach statistical significance.",

Secondly, and more importantly, German teachers with information about grades seem to have used mathematics achievement to derive German self-concept, in the same way that informed mathematics teachers did. Thus, informed teachers seem to make slight use of dimensional comparison information in the estimation of students' German self-concept, but in an assimilative way: They do not comprehend the contrastive dimensional comparisons their students draw, but derive a positive (negative) German self-concept partly from a positive (negative) mathematics achievement. For German teachers, this assimilative usage of the mathematics grade in combination with an unaltered social comparison effect may have caused the (slight) deterioration of judgment accuracy in the estimation of students' German self-concepts.",

Because only mathematics teachers participated in their study, the authors concluded that mathematics teachers assume mathematics achievement to be diagnostically relevant for verbal self-concept, because mathematics as their subject is of a higher subjective importance for them than German is. In the present study, rather assimilative effects of mathematics achievement on inferred German self-concept could be found for both, mathematics as well as German teachers; Pohlmann et al.'s (2004) explication yet would suggest that for German teachers, rather the effect of German achievement on inferred mathematics self-concept should turn out significant, which was not the case. Pohlmann et al.'s (2004) explication thus cannot be applied fully to our results. It rather might be that mathematics as well as German teachers attribute a higher diagnostic relevance to mathematics achievement than to verbal achievement regarding achievement and self-concept in other academic areas. This presumption should be tested in future studies by asking teachers about their opinions about the diagnostic relevance of different subject-specific achievements for self-concepts in other subjects.",

The tasks in those studies may have been rather artificial as no other information about the fictitious student was made available except the information about achievements in both subjects. In our studies, teachers were told to estimate their real students' self-concepts. In doing so, they may have been led by consistency strivings (e.g., Festinger, 1954) , which cause people to describe well-known persons as consistently as possible. This way seemingly contradictory information about a person might be avoided to obviate a state of tension resulting from this contradictory information. For teachers, information on diverging subject-specific self-concepts a well-known student possesses could seem contradictory, especially for students doing well in both subjects.",

For parents, Marsh and Byrne's (1993) assumption may hold that student-other agreement between self-concepts and inferred self-concepts is higher when the other person knows the student in a wide range of contexts. As outlined, Marsh and Craven (1991) as well assume that parents take information obtained in the conversations with their children into account very strongly when inferring their children's self-concepts. This information is likely to contain different self-views for different subjects. In contrast, teachers who only teach one subject in a certain class are not very likely to get to know students' self-views regarding other subjects except their own. This may be the reason why parents actually take contrastive dimensional comparisons into account, while teachers do not, because for example their striving for consistency leads them to derive a good German self-concept from a good mathematics achievement.",

Future research could also assess whether teachers are aware of the assumptions of their students, which according to our results does not seem very likely.

Regarding the latter and based on previous research, the present studies analyzed whether teachers in the estimation of students' self-concepts use social and dimensional comparisons when given the necessary information about students' achievements.

Yet, in Study 1 it was shown that mathematics teachers with information about grades not only used German achievement more strongly in the estimation of students' German self-concepts, but as well mathematics achievement in the estimation of students' mathematics self-concepts. Nevertheless, similar studies could assess teachers' previous knowledge about students' grades in both subjects. Also, teachers teaching other subjects than mathematics and German could be surveyed to ensure that they do not have information about the grades. In our study, regarding practical implications and as outlined above, we thought it relevant to clarify for a start, how mathematics and German teachers' judgment accuracy can be improved, as they are teachers of the main science and the main verbal subject (at German schools), and whether these teachers draw social and dimensional comparisons within and between the two subjects.",

Yet, it might be that informed teachers show a higher relation between student achievement and inferred self-concept, because they try to consciously or subconsciously, reaffirm the grades students received by students' assumed self-beliefs. Also, the significant effects of mathematics achievement on inferred self-concept in German in both studies possibly might not result from a dimensional comparison per se, but from a conscious application of the rationale that students achieving well in mathematics should possess a positive general academic self-concept, and thus a positive verbal self-concept as well.

Our results suggest that teachers generally do not assume students to consider their achievement in another subject, especially not in a contrastive way. Accordingly, information about dimensional comparisons, their possible reasons and their possible consequences can support teachers in inferring students' subject-specific self-concepts more accurately, in adequately dealing with students' subjective theories about abilities in the mathematic and the verbal domain as well as in encouraging students in subjects in which they possess a low ability self-concept because of dimensional comparisons. If teachers do not consider dimensional comparisons, they miss a process central to students' self-concept formation. Counter-intuitive subject-specific student self-concepts in many cases may be caused by contrastive dimensional comparisons: For example, a high-ability student with good grades in every subject may still underestimate the own abilities in one area when performing less well in this area than in another (see Plucker & Stocking, 2001 ). On the other hand, dimensional comparisons may enable low-performing students to form relatively high ability self-concepts for the areas in which they intra-individually perform best (see . Teachers, who do not take dimensional comparisons into account even when they are informed about students' grades, fail to judge students' self-concepts as adequately as they could. Judging students' self-concepts more adequately in turn can help teachers adapt their teaching more closely to the motivational requirements of their students in order to create learning conditions as good as possible for each individual student (e.g., Schrader, 2010) . To sum up, the present studies were the first to bring together research on teacher judgment accuracy and research on the I/E model. Although teachers mostly refrain from considering dimensional comparison information when estimating students' self-concepts, teacher judgment accuracy in the teachers' subject was relatively high. This pattern may be caused by the strong effects that social comparison information (i.e. grades) has on students' self-concepts as well as on teachers' inferences of students' self-concepts.",
