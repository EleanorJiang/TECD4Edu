When including multiple school subjects in the I/E model, cross-paths between self-concept and achievement measures of non-matching domains (depicting dimensional achievement comparison processes) have been found to be negative as well as positive. Hence, dimensional achievement comparison processes can lead to contrast effects (negative cross-paths) or to assimilation effects (positive cross-paths). In the case of contrast effects, dimensional comparison processes evoke positive consequences for one subject (e.g., high math self-concept given high math achievement) and negative consequences for the contrasted subject (e.g., low verbal self-concept given high math achievement). In the case of assimilation effects, dimensional comparison processes induce positive consequences for both subjects concerned (e.g., high math and physics self-concepts given high levels of math and physics achievements, Jansen et al., 2015; Marsh et al., 2015) .",

History self-concept was further found to be negatively affected by math and biology achievements indicating contrast effects. The paths leading from the other domain-specific achievements (i.e., German, English, and physics achievements) to history self-concept were not statistically significant. History achievement, in turn, did not demonstrate any significant relations to non-matching domain-specific self-concept facets (i.e., German, English, biology, math, and physics self-concepts). Hence, based on these findings, the role of dimensional comparison processes involving history remains unclear and should be subject to further research. However, other studies on history self-concept (Brunner et al., 2010; Schilling et al., 2006) only considered correlations among self-concepts or correlations between self-concept and achievement measures and are thus not adequately suited to provide insights into dimensional achievement comparison processes at play in the formation of history self-concept. Hence, there seems to be a need for further studies extending the I/E model to history in order to replicate the findings from Marsh et al. (2015) when using other student samples and self-concept measures.",

The observation of contrast and assimilation effects resulting from extended I/E models was used to locate domain-specific self-concepts on the math-verbal continuum of academic self-concepts. In the case of contrast effects, subjects are assumed to be located far from each other on the mathverbal continuum. The prototypic example concerns math and verbal subjects. Math and verbal achievement and self-concept measures have consistently been found to be negatively related to each other, and this contrast effect has served to place math and verbal self-concepts at the opposite ends of a continuum of academic self-concepts. Smaller contrast effects were observed for physics and verbal subjects. Physics (verbal) achievement and verbal (physics) self-concept have also been found to be negatively related to each other, but the respective negative cross-paths were smaller in size compared to the cross-paths between pure math (verbal) achievement and pure verbal (math) self-concept (Jansen et al., 2015; Marsh et al., 2015) . This finding has been taken as evidence that physics and verbal self-concepts are still positioned at opposite ends of the math-verbal continuum with physics self-concept being located next to the math endpoint. Yet, physics and verbal selfconcepts seem to be closer to each other than pure math and verbal self-concepts, the latter representing the extreme opposite endpoints.",

In the original version of this model, self-concept in social studies was proposed to be located nearer the verbal endpoint (Marsh, 1990b) . However, the findings from the only study that has so far included history in an I/E model (Marsh et al., 2015) can only partially support this assumption for history self-concept. The negative relation between math achievement and history self-concept indicates a contrast effect and thus indeed argues in favor of history self-concept being verballike. However, this conclusion was not corroborated by simultaneously occurring assimilation effects between achievement and self-concept measures for history and verbal subjects. Hence, further research seems necessary on the location of history self-concept on the mathverbal continuum of domain-specific academic self-concepts.",

Therefore, the present study aims to provide insight into assimilation and contrast effects presumably at play in the formation of history and politics self-concepts. It thus contributes to and expands on contemporary research on the I/E model and dimensional comparison processes (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) .

The MLR estimator is robust against violations of normality assumptions of the measured variables and sensitive to the treatment of categorical variables originating from the Likert scale response format as continuous variables (Beauducel & Herzberg, 2006) . Given the parallel wordings of the items used to measure students' self-concepts in the five school subjects, correlated uniquenesses were integrated in all models to take shared method variance into account . The small amount of missing data (self-concepts: German: 0.00%; English: 0.00% to 0.74%; math: 0.00% to 0.37%; physics: 0.00% to 0.74%; history: 0.00% to 0.74%; achievements: German: 0.37%; English: 0.00%; math: 0.00%; physics: 1.11%; history: 0.00%) was taken into account by the full maximum likelihood estimator (FIML) implemented in Mplus, which is known as an efficient and trustworthy method of handling missing data (Enders, 2010; Graham, 2009) .",

The first set of models bases on the classic I/E model and thus only adds history self-concept and achievement to math and verbal (German) self-concepts and achievements. The second set of models considered all five subject domains available in the data set (i.e., math, English, German, physics, and history) and thus extended the I/E model to multiple school subjects, including history. These two sets of models each started with a confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) model stating separate factors for achievements and self-concepts in the considered domains and then proceeded with latent regression models. The regression models followed the I/E model framework in which the different domain-specific self-concept factors were regressed on the different domain-specific achievement factors. These two model approaches (i.e., the CFA model and the I/E model-like regression model) are statistically equivalent leading to the same model fit because the correlations of the CFA model are only replaced by path coefficients in the latent regression model. We argue in favor of regression models as the appropriate approach to studying dimensional comparison processes in the formation of domain-specific academic self-concepts, since regression models estimate the paths leading from domain-specific achievements to domain-specific academic self-concepts while controlling for the other relations. Thus, we report the findings from the regression models in the main manuscript, while the results from the complementary CFA models are reported in the Online Supplements.",

Hence, one subsample of students only completed the measures for one subject while another subsample of students only completed measures for another subject.

Since a measure for history self-concept was not available in the data set of Study 2, future studies are necessary to examine the relation between politics achievement and history self-concept.

Rather than being more closely linked to either the verbal or the math endpoint, history and politics self-concepts seem to be similarly, albeit loosely, related to both endpoints. Originally, self-concept in social studies subjects was proposed to be located nearer the verbal endpoint (Marsh, 1990b ). Yet, the present findings suggest a reformulation according to which self-concepts related to the domain of social studies would be better placed at the center of the math-verbal continuum. This suggestion also matches the findings of previous work according to which history self-concept was found to be related to both mathlike and verbal-like self-concept and achievement measures (Brunner et al., 2010; Marsh et al., 2015; Schilling et al., 2006) . Moreover, pursuant to the found assimilation effect between history achievement and politics self-concept, history and politics self-concepts should be classified as adjacent facets forming a separate category of self-concepts related to the domain of social studies. The remaining findings from the I/E models extended to multiple school subjects presented here largely correspond to findings from previous research. Replicating the original I/E model (M\u00f6ller et al., 2009) , contrast effects were consistently found between math and verbal achievement and self-concept measures irrespective of whether German (students' native language) or English (students' foreign language) were used as verbal indicators. Smaller, yet consistent contrast effects were found between German and English on the one hand and physics on the other hand. For the Marsh/Shavelson model of academic selfconcept (Marsh, 1990b) , these findings imply that self-concepts with regard to German and English and self-concepts with regard to math and physics are located far from each other, at opposite ends of the math-verbal continuum. An assimilation effect was found between math and physics. Since this finding occurred in many studies (Jansen et al., 2015; Marsh et al., 2015; M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & K\u00f6ller, 2006) , it can be seen as robust and consistent. Hence, math and physics self-concepts seem to constitute the math end of the continuum. An assimilation effect would have also been expected between German (native language) and English (foreign language), if they were placed close to each other on the verbal end of the continuum. However, Study 1 revealed an unclear pattern since there was a positive, yet non-significant path from English achievement to German self-concept, but a significant negative path leading from German achievement to English self-concept which rather represented a contrast effect. Thereby, the pattern of findings emanating from Study 1 matches the so far mixed pattern of findings regarding the verbal domain which encompass contrast effects (Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2001; Marsh & Yeung, 2001; Xu et al., 2013) as well as assimilation effects (Marsh et al., 2014; M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & K\u00f6ller, 2006) between selfconcepts and achievements of different languages.",

Indeed, the two-dimensional math-verbal continuum of academic self-concepts proposed in the Marsh/Shavelson model has remained hypothetical and observations of contrast and assimilation effects cannot be taken as indisputable empirical evidence. Hence, alternative conceptualizations of the internal organization of domain-specific academic self-concepts are conceivable. Students' perceived similarity versus dissimilarity between school subjects has been found to influence the consequences of dimensional comparison processes in terms of contrast and assimilation effects (Helm, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, Nagy, & M\u00f6ller, 2016; . Perceptions of similarity between two domains induce assimilation effects while perceptions of dissimilarity evoke contrast effects. Hence, rather than only locating academic self-concepts somewhere in between the math and verbal endpoints of a two-dimensional continuum, students might position domain-specific self-concepts in a multidimensional space with the distance between them varying according to the degree of perceived similarity of the domains. Qualitative studies (see for example M\u00f6ller & Husemann, 2006) or person-centered approaches might be useful to gain insight into the structure and organization of domain-specific academic self-concepts in students' minds.",

They might also affect students' approaches to achievement comparisons, for example by influencing the relevance and weighting students attribute to their level of school achievement in one subject relative to another. In addition, students' learning environment and school context might foster or weaken social and dimensional achievement comparison processes (Ames, 1992) . With special regard to the social studies domain, it should be examined whether the operation and consequences of dimensional comparison processes might vary contingent upon whether history and politics are taught integratively or as separate subjects.",

Given the cross-sectional design of the studies, temporal relations among constructs could not be investigated and should thus be inspected in future longitudinal studies (M\u00f6ller, Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2011; Niepel, Brunner, & Preckel, 2014) . Study 2 included history achievement along with politics self-concept and achievement, but further studies including self-concept as well as achievement measures for both history and politics are needed. In this regard, it would be preferable to integrate even more subjects from the domain of social studies such as geography or economics. Research would benefit even more from studies that include social studies subjects along with a variety of other (math-like and verbal-like) school subjects to test largely extended I/E models. Information on students' class membership was not available in Study 1 and future studies are advised to always take the hierarchical data structure into account. Studies based on larger and more diverse samples would allow for testing the generalizability of the findings across subsamples of students from different educational contexts or cultural backgrounds.",
