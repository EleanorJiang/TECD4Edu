In her expectancy-value model, for example, Eccles (1983) proposed ASC to play a central role in the development of motivation and academic choice behavior. ASC enhancement is thus a major focus of concern in settings such as education and child development (e.g., Branden, 1994; Marsh, 2007; Marsh & O'Mara, 2008) .",

Many studies have shown that the two constructs are substantially correlated, but the question of why this correlation exists has remained unanswered to some degree (see Marsh & Craven, 2006) . In this article, we propose and test a comprehensive model that integrates two of the major theoretical models in the field: the reciprocal effects model (REM; Marsh & Craven, 2006; Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004) and the internal/external frame of reference model (I/E model; Marsh, 1986; Marsh & Hau, 2004; M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2009) . The REM posits that ASC and achievement are reciprocally related, superseding models positing that achievement causes ASC or that ASC causes achievement (Marsh & Craven, 2006) . Tests of the REM are based on longitudinal data with repeated measures of ASC and achievement within a domain. The I/E model addresses the extreme domain specificity of relations between mathematics achievement (MAch), verbal achievement (VAch), mathematics self-concept (MSC), and verbal self-concept (VSC). It postulates positive effects from achievements in one domain on ASCs in the corresponding domain (e.g., MAch to MSC) but negative effects from achievement on noncorresponding ASCs (e.g., MAch to VSC). Tests of the I/E model are typically based on cross-sectional measures of the four constructs. Tests of the combination of the two models-the RI/E model-therefore require longitudinal data on achievement and ASC in both domains. While research on both models separately has been productive, an integration suggests additional effects of self-concepts on subsequent achievements in noncorresponding domains not present when either framework is considered in isolation. This additional process applies the logic of the I/E M\u00f6ller et al.",

Are there reciprocal cross-domain effects from achievements on academic self-concepts and from academic self-concepts on achievements (extending the REM)? Are there negative effects of self-concepts on subsequent achievements in noncorresponding domains (extending both models)?

An integration of the two models, the REM (Marsh & Craven, 2006) , postulated that ASC and achievement are reciprocally related-both are a cause and an effect of the other.

As illustrated in Figure 1a , the REM proposes: (a) strong positive paths from prior measures of achievement and ASC to subsequent measures of the same construct (continuous lines in Figure 1a ), (b) positive paths from prior ASC to subsequent achievements, and (c) positive paths from prior achievements to subsequent ASC. Positive paths from prior measures of achievement and ASC on subsequent measures of the same construct may be interpreted as evidence for the stability of the measures. Several empirical studies have indeed found evidence for the stability of ASCs and achievements, even with quite young students (e.g., Helmke & van Aken, 1995; Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 1998) . Positive effects of high ASCs in a domain on subsequent achievements in the same domain may be caused by higher engagement and time investment in domain-specific activities, which are conducive to learning (Marsh & Yeung, 1997) .",

However, the I/E model only addresses effects of achievements on ASCs, ignoring the effects of ASCs on achievements.

The RI/E model proposes positive effects of achievements and ASCs on subsequent achievements and ASCs in the corresponding domains but negative effects of achievements on subsequent ASCs in noncorresponding (contrasting) domains. Up to this point, the predictions of the RI/E model are consistent with those of both single models. The I/E model is extended longitudinally; the REM is extended to more than one domain. The combination of longitudinal measures of all four constructs makes it possible to additionally test for the effect of prior ASC in one domain on subsequent achievement in another domain. Specifically, the question is whether MSC has a negative impact on subsequent verbal achievement and whether VSC has a negative impact on subsequent mathematics achievement when prior indicators of both measures are controlled. The logic of the I/E model suggests that these effects of ASC on subsequent achievement in noncorresponding (contrasting) domains may be negative. The reason may be that students tend to compare their MSCs and VSCs and that this comparison leads to stronger engagement and time investment in the domain in which they have a higher self-concept and to reduced engagement and time invested in the domain in which they feel less confident. Both processes may lower achievement in the domain in which they have a lower self-concept. However, given the strong domain specificity of self-concepts, we postulate only weak negative effects of self-concepts on subsequent achievements in noncorresponding domains. The answers to these new questions have important theoretical implications as well as important practical and policy-related implications in terms of how to enhance achievement in different domains.",

However, little can yet be said about the longitudinal impact of ASCs on subsequent achievements in noncorresponding domains. The available findings suggest that these cross-domain effects of prior ASCs on subsequent achievements tend to be slightly negative when prior achievements and ASCs are controlled.

Current best practice is to use either multiple imputation or full-information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML). Although asymptotically equivalent when based on the same data, multiple imputation has potentially important strategic advantages, in that it is possible to include background variables that are not part of the model to be tested, whereas FIML is typically limited to the variables included in the model.

School grades, however, were measured with a single indicator and included as manifest variables in all models. SEM research typically focuses on the ability of a priori models to fit the data, as summarized by sample size independent indexes of fit (e.g., Marsh, 2007; Marsh, Balla & Hau, 1996; Marsh, Balla, & McDonald, 1988) . Here, we considered the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), as operationalized in Mplus in association with the MLR estimator (L. K. Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2008) . We also considered the robust x 2 test statistic and parameter estimates. TLI and CFI values greater than .90 or .95 are typically interpreted to reflect an acceptable or excellent fit to the data. RMSEA values smaller than .05 or .08 are typically interpreted to reflect a close or a reasonable fit to the data. In confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) studies, it is sometimes more useful to compare the relative fit of different models in a nested or partially nested taxonomy of models (Marsh, 2007) . Any two models are nested if the set of parameters estimated in the more restrictive model is a subset of the parameters estimated in the less restrictive model. This comparison can be based on a chi-square difference test. However, this test presents the same problems as the chi-square test used to test goodness of fit, which led to the development of fit indexes (see . For this reason, researchers have posited a variety of ad hoc guidelines for evaluating when differences in fit are sufficiently large to reject a more parsimonious model (i.e., the more highly constrained model with fewer estimated parameters) in favor of a more complex model. It has been suggested that support for the more parsimonious model requires a change in CFI of less than .01 (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002) or a change in RMSEA of less than .015. Marsh (2007) noted that some indexes (e.g., TLI and RMSEA) incorporate a penalty for lack of parsimony so that a more parsimonious model can fit the data better than a less parsimonious model (i.e., the gain in parsimony is greater than the loss in fit).

Between T1 and T2 they changed to different secondary schools and school tracks. From T2 to T6 they stayed in their whole classes, with some unsystematic exceptions. Therefore, cross-nested data are a minor problem. Since we used grades as achievement indicators, class average achievement only varied at T1 because grades from elementary schools were recorded (see previous discussion). Secondary school grades typically do not vary among classes because teachers, when they assign grades, provide them with a normal distribution in their mind, that is, few students get an A or a F, some more a B and D, and most C. As a result, the class means are more or less the same. The same is true, however, in schools, where classes within schools do not differ in their average grades. To support this argument, we checked whether there was systematic variance of grades among classes at T3 and T5. As expected, intraclass correlations were below .10. Due to the aforementioned reasons, the intraclass correlation at T1 was larger (.44 for German and .35 for math).",

Total effects are the sum of all direct (unmediated) and indirect (mediated) effects between two variables. Direct effects were defined as the standardized path coefficients when all variables were included in the model. Indirect effects were defined as the standardized effects that were mediated by intervening variables. For example, in Figure 1c , the path from T1 MAch to T4 VSC via T2 MSC and T3 VAch is an indirect path, in which T2 MSC and T3 VAch mediate the effects of T1 MAch on T4 VSC. Separate tests of statistical significance were conducted for each direct and indirect effect (see L. K. Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2008) . Partialing out the effects of specific intervening variables provides an indication of how important the intervening variables are in mediating effects of prior variables on subsequent outcomes. In Mplus, we used the IND command to request a specific indirect effect (e.g., the path T1 MAch ! T2 MSC ! T3 VAch ! T4 VSC only). Direct, indirect, and total effects were examined for both domain-specific reciprocal effects models and for the RI/E model (see Tables 2 and 3) .",

As in the Marsh and K\u00f6ller (2004) study, we found strong support for the effects of prior self-concepts on subsequent academic achievement. Hence, as predicted by the selfenhancement model, ASC has significant path coefficients to academic achievement, and as predicted by the skill development model, there are even stronger path coefficients from academic achievement to ASC. Both effects were stronger for adjacent measurement points. Our central hypotheses for the REM were (1) positive paths from achievements to corresponding self-concepts, even when prior grades and self-concepts were controlled, and (b) positive paths from self-concepts to corresponding achievements, even when prior grades and self-concepts were controlled. For mathematics, Hypothesis 1 was supported for the effects from T1 to T2, T3 to T4, and T5 to T6. Hypothesis 2 was supported for the effects from T2 to T3 and T4 to T5.

Because tests of the I/E model are typically based on a single wave of data and tests of the REM are typically based on a single domain, there have to date been few satisfactory tests of this prediction. The results of our study provide some support for this prediction, but the support is not strong.

In summary, there is some support for the prediction that prior ASCs would have small negative effects on grades in the noncorresponding domain (Prediction 10). 2 Although the support for the prediction of negative effects is not strong, there is no evidence that the effects are positive.

Consistent with the REM, there were significant effects of prior ASC on subsequent achievement and of prior achievement on subsequent ASC in both verbal and mathematics domains. Combining verbal and mathematics constructs within a single model provided even stronger support for the REM than considering the two domains separately (the typical test of the REM). These findings thus extend previous support for the hypothesis that there is a reciprocal relation between ASC and achievement, each being an effect and a cause of the other. The results have important implications for educational practice, indicating that in order to enhance either ASC or achievement, it is important to target both constructs.

Although few previous I/E studies have implemented a longitudinal design, their findings are consistent with the results of the present investigation in supporting the assumptions of the I/E model. Prior achievement in one domain has negative effects on ASCs in noncorresponding domains. Moreover, there seems to be a reciprocality of these effects (Marsh & K\u00f6ller, 2004; Valentine et al., 2004) .

In the Marsh and K\u00f6ller study, these effects were consistently significant, whereas in our study only some of these negative effects were statistically significant.

                "text": "Second, observers seem to be quite insensitive to the internal and dimensional comparison processes that are the basis of the I/E model. When teachers think about a student's self-concept, they tend to reflect primarily the social comparison process, meaning that teachers' reflections are not nearly as domain specific as their students' responses (Marsh, Smith, & Barnes, 1984) . Teachers tend to assume that students who are bright in one area will have good ASCs in all areas and that students who are weak performers in one area will have poor ASCs in all areas. This seems to apply not only to teachers but also to parents (Dai, 2002) and classmates (Pohlmann, M\u00f6ller, & Streblow, 2004) . Third, with regard to the RI/E model, it seems unlikely that teachers and parents know a great deal about the reciprocity of achievements and selfconcepts within and across domains. It is an open question whether teachers and parents are able to accurately estimate the reciprocity of the relationships between achievement and self-concept over time and to consider the strong domain specificity of ASCs, in particular. Like our present study, almost all previous studies testing the I/E model or the REM have focused on mathematics and the native language. An interesting extension of the models is to explore other subjects from the verbal and mathematical domains, as has been done in some I/E research (e.g., Bong, 1998; Marsh et al., 2001; Nagy, Trautwein, Baumert, K\u00f6ller, & Garrett, 2006; Yeung, Lee, & Wong, 2001) . Some researchers have found negative paths between certain languages; others have found positive paths from mathematics (physics) achievement to physics (mathematics) self-concept (M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & K\u00f6ller, 2006) . Relations between achievement and self-concept indicators seem to be affected by students' beliefs on the characteristics of the subjects. If students consider abilities in two subjects to be positively correlated, the impact of dimensional comparisons decreases, and the paths from an indicator in one domain to an indicator in the other may even be positive. If, on the other hand, they consider abilities in two subjects to be negatively correlated, dimensional comparisons cause negative paths from one domain to the other .",

As yet, there is no empirical evidence that these types of internal comparisons influence selfconcepts or achievements in the same way as social and dimensional comparisons.

Relative to Reciprocal I/E Model most previous research, our study is methodologically stronger in terms of the use of: longitudinal data for achievements and self-concepts in two domains, latent model variables, multiple imputation for missing data (particularly important for longitudinal studies), the complex design option to correct for nested samples, and robust tests of fit and standard errors that are robust in relation to violations of normality. Theoretically, our research presents a new theoretical model-the RI/E model-that integrates the two main theoretical models of relations between ASC and achievement. From a practical perspective, the domain specificity of the reciprocal effects model has important implications for interventions seeking to enhance achievement or self-concept. Whereas studies of the REM have clearly demonstrated that the best way to enhance either ASC or achievement is to enhance both constructs, the RI/E model brings new implications to these findings. In particular, enhancement of either the mathematics or the verbal domain is likely to have negative effects in the other domain. Fortunately, the negative effects in the contrasting domain appear to be small in relation to the positive effects in the corresponding domain, meaning that the net effects across all domains are positive. Nevertheless, it is critical for teachers, policymakers, and researchers to realize that enhancement of one domain is not likely to generalize to the other domain.",
