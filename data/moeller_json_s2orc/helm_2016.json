As they influence motivation and effort in various domains (Eccles, O'Neill, & Wigfield, 2005) , students' ability-related selfconcepts are seen as a major determinant of subsequent learning (e.g., Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & M\u00f6ller, 2014; Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004) .",

(1988) . Self-concepts for subjects that clearly belong either to the mathematical (math, physics, chemistry) or to the verbal domain (the mother tongue, foreign languages) are positioned at the end points of the continuum, as correlations between these subjects typically are very low. Self-concepts for other academic subjects also can be assigned along this continuum (Marsh et al., 1988) . In DCT, subjects whose self-concepts are positioned far from each other on the continuum are called \"dissimilar\" subjects, whereas subjects whose self-concepts are positioned adjacent to each other are \"similar\" subjects. The assumption of a correspondence between self-concept correlations and subject similarity is addressed in a study by Haag and G\u00f6tz (2012) , who showed that mathematical subjects, like math and physics, are indeed described by students as very similar to each other in relation to various subject characteristics. For example, they are described as dealing with highly difficult connected topics that require a high degree of effort. In addition, verbal domain subjects, like English and German, are characterized as very similar to each other. For example, they are described as subjects with an emphasis on an exchange of views on topics that are up-to-date and relevant for daily life. Subjects from the mathematical and the verbal areas, respectively, were, however, characterized by students as very different from each other. The study by Haag and G\u00f6tz therefore supports DCT's assumption that subjects whose self-concept 2 correlations are small are perceived as rather dissimilar and that subjects with high self-concept correlations are perceived as more similar.",

This contrast effect between verbal and math self-concepts is caused by dimensional comparisons (M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001 ): students' intraindividual comparisons of their achievement in one subject with that in other subjects. As a result of dimensional comparisons, students form their ability self-concept in any given subject in relation to their achievement in other subjects. For example, imagine two students with identical grades in math. The contrast effect of dimensional comparisons expresses itself in the phenomenon that a student with a better English grade will develop a lower math self-concept than a student with a lower English grade. This contrastive effect of dimensional comparisons between verbal and mathematical subjects has been shown in various path-analytic (e.g., M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2009; Marsh et al., 2014 Marsh et al., , 2015 and introspective studies (M\u00f6ller & Husemann, 2006) . Furthermore, experimental studies demonstrate the impact of dimensional comparisons on math-related and verbal self-concepts. M\u00f6ller and K\u00f6ller (2001) , for example, set participants to work on tasks related to math ability and then tested how manipulated feedback on their math achievement in these tasks affected verbal selfconcept. Verbal self-concept was rated lower when the feedback on their achievement on the math-related tasks was high, and higher when it was low. Further, Pohlmann and M\u00f6ller (2009;  Study 3) analyzed self-concept differences in the math domain between participants who had been given different levels of performance feedback in the verbal domain, whereas feedback for performance in the math domain was held constant. There were strong differences in math self-concept across the different levels of verbal feedback: Math self-concept was lower after verbal feedback was high. Strickhouser and Zell (2015) found similar effects of feedback on verbal self-concept for math-related tasks.",

Students who believed the underlying abilities to be negatively correlated and thus very dissimilar from each other showed much stronger differences between math and verbal self-concepts (while controlling for math and verbal achievement) than did students who believed in the independence or positive correspondence of math and verbal abilities. When students' beliefs regarding the interdependence of math and verbal abilities were interpreted as an aspect of perceived subject similarity, this study showed that aspects of perceived subject similarity moderated the effects of dimensional comparisons in respect to math and verbal self-concept differences.

However, all of this research is cross-sectional and does not allow for causal assumptions. Accordingly, although a correspondence between subject similarity and self-concept correlations is postulated in DCT, the theory does not describe a causal effect between these variables. More precisely, DCT assumes that subjects for which contrastive effects of dimensional comparisons, and thus stronger self-concept differences, can be found are perceived to be rather dissimilar (like math and English) and that weaker contrastive or assimilative effects of dimensional comparisons, and thus smaller self-concept differences, are found when two subjects are perceived to be more similar (like math and physics). In making this assumption, DCT goes beyond the original internal/external frame-of-reference model (I/E model; Marsh, 1986) , which describes the effects of dimensional comparisons on subject-specific self-concepts without integrating the variables that may moderate the effects of dimensional comparisons. DCT's assumption of a direct correspondence between self-concept correlations and perceived similarity of the related subjects has not been directly tested until now.",

The study aimed to replicate the results of Study 1 by applying the priming paradigm in school subjects that were expected to be seen as rather similar by students. Accordingly, the study was set up to trigger perceived similarities or dissimilarities between math and physics in Study 2a and between German and English in Study 2b. As Marsh et al. (2015) point out, self-concept differences are lower when both compared subjects come from the same academic domain cluster (math/ science or verbal) of the similarity continuum. However, we also assumed that similarity perceptions for subjects from the same domain were malleable and aimed to prove the general role of perceived subject similarity in dimensional comparisons for two subjects that are adjacent on the academic similarity continuum. Thus, our hypothesis again is that a lower perceived similarity between math and physics (Study 2a) or between German and English (Study 2b) leads to greater differences between subject-specific self-concepts than does a higher perceived similarity.",

On the one hand, students who perceive two subjects as dissimilar show stronger differences between their self-concepts than do students who perceive two subjects as similar. Both perceptions may have particular strengths and shortcomings: The perception of a lower similarity of two subjects can be beneficial, since it increases self-concept differences and subsequently leads to a more differentiated self-concept, with greater accentuation of strengths and weaknesses. As self-complexity research suggests, such differentiated selfconcepts often lead to higher overall well-being (e.g., Koch & Shepperd, 2004) . This finding is consistent with the results of M\u00f6ller and Husemann (2006) , who found that after a negative event or negative feedback in one domain, people often draw dimensional comparisons with a more favorable domain, thereby enhancing their mood by focusing less on the worse-off domain and more on the better-off domain (see also M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) . The perception of low similarity of school subjects may have positive consequences for the intraindividually better-off subject and yet have negative consequences for self-concept in the intraindividually worse-off subject. This is important because self-concepts influence subsequent motivation, course choices, and achievement in the related area (e.g., Eccles et al., 2005; Marsh & K\u00f6ller, 2004; M\u00f6ller, Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2011; Retelsdorf et al., 2014; Valentine et al., 2004) . Thus, students benefiting from the contrastive effects of dimensional comparisons through enhanced self-concept in their better subject may also benefit in academic achievement and achievement-related variables for this subject as well, while suffering correspondingly in their worse subject. However, studies testing the effects of self-concept on noncorresponding achievement (see studies testing the reciprocal I/E model, e.g., M\u00f6ller et al., 2011; M\u00f6ller, Zimmermann, & K\u00f6ller, 2014) show only very small direct effects of selfconcept on nonmatching achievement. Yet, the effect of selfconcept on motivation and achievement in the corresponding area can pose a problem for students who develop an unrealistically low self-concept of their ability, as this eventually diminishes their motivation and greatly reduces their effort in this subject (e.g., K\u00f6ller, Daniels, Schnabel, & Baumert, 2000) ; students may also prematurely opt to specialize in the other subject. One group of students, among others, for whom this could be the case is gifted children, who also are subject to the effects of dimensional comparisons (Plucker & Stocking, 2001) . As this group of students is likely to achieve well in a broad range of academic matters, devaluation of and reduced effort in a subject where they achieve less well and yet in which they are nevertheless interested would be an unfortunate result of dimensional comparisons.",

Factors that influence students' perceived subject similarity may include, for example, teachers' (and parents') perceptions of subject (dis)similarity. Teachers' and parents' attitudes are also in general important influences on students' attitudes (e.g., Eccles Parsons, Adler, & Kaczala, 1982; Shavelson et al., 1976) . Teachers who pronounce dissimilarity beliefs for different subjects may contribute to bigger selfconcept differences in students, whereas similarity beliefs may contribute to smaller self-concept differences. Hence, for students with strong, overaccentuated self-concept differences and a resulting diminished self-concept in their weaker subject, it could be beneficial to show them quite explicitly the similarities between different school subjects-for example, the dependence of achievement in every subject upon interest, effort, and learning strategies. Teachers should also know about the consequences of similarity beliefs and should communicate to students that different academic abilities are not mutually exclusive.",

The manipulation check showed lower perceived similarity for the low-similarity group (M = 2.29, SD = 0.80) than for the high-similarity group (M = 2.44, SD = 0.97), indicating successful realization of the independent variable, t(345) = 1.63, p < .05, d = 0.17.Covariate.The difference between math and German achievement did not differ significantly between the two priming groups (high-similarity group, M = 0.73, SD = 0.72; low-similarity group, M = 0.72, SD = 0.66), t(349) = 0.05, ns, d = 0.01.Testing of the Hypothesis. The absolute difference between math and German self-concepts was greater in the low-similarity group (M = 1.13, SD = 0.83) than in the high-similarity group (M = 0.95, SD = 0.89), t(349) = 2.12, p < .05, d = 0.23; thus, our hypothesis was confirmed. 1",
