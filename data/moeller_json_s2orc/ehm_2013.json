Studies that focused mainly on secondary school students have demonstrated the multidimensional nature of academic self-concept and the so-called dimensional comparison effects between various self-concept facets (M\u00f6ller and K\u00f6ller 2001 ; see also Marsh and Hau 2004; M\u00f6ller et al. 2006b ). Regarding elementary school education, however, validations of the I/E model are sparse and the impact of dimensional comparisons on self-concept development remains unclear. Surprisingly, former investigations have focused on reading and math only, although learning to write-especially to spell-is also one of the major goals during the elementary school years. As a consequence, the influence of writing 1 achievement on the corresponding and non-corresponding self-concepts is still unknown.",

High levels of academic self-concept are associated with high self-efficacy (Bong and Skaalvik 2003) , cognitive and emotional engagement in school (Helmke 1999 ), a pronounced learning and achievement motivation, as well as academic effort (Guay et al. 2010 ).

Shavelson et al. (1976) presented an influential multifaceted and hierarchically structured model of self-concepts, which had a fundamental impact on further self-concept research. The model postulates a general self-concept at the apex of the self-concept hierarchy, which is subdivided into a nonacademic and an academic component (partitioned into various subjectspecific subdomains, e.g., English and mathematics). While the claim for multidimensionality was strongly supported, the model's central assumption that the self-concepts in particular academic areas are highly correlated and form a higher-order academic self-concept was not substantiated (Marsh et al. 1988; Marsh 1989 Marsh , 1990b Marsh and Shavelson 1985) . However, Marsh (1989) demonstrated that by the age of about 10 years, children's math and verbal self-concepts were basically uncorrelated. Pursuant to these findings, Marsh (1986) developed the I/E model.",

The interindividual or social comparison (external frame of reference) is defined by students' self-perceptions of their own achievements compared to the perceived achievements of other students (Marsh et al. 1988 ). Because achievements in school subjects are positively correlated, it seems reasonable to assume that domain-specific self-concepts are also positively correlated. Empirically, no such positive relation between the math and English self-concept was found (Marsh 1986 ). Marsh argues that students compare their performance in one school subject intra-individually with their performance in other subjects. This dimensional comparison (M\u00f6ller and K\u00f6ller 2001) builds the internal frame of reference and can lead to a contrast effect: achievement in one subject has a negative effect on the self-concept in other subjects and incrementally increases the differences between various self-concept domains. Thus, students perceive math and verbal achievement as being more different than they actually are.",

For example students A and B have the same grade in math but different grades in German (student A has a higher grade compared to math, student B has a lower grade). Thus, student B will demonstrate a higher math self-concept compared to student A (M\u00f6ller et al. 2009) . Furthermore, comparison processes lead to an overestimation of one's own strengths and an underestimation of one's intra-individually weaker domain. However, because downward comparisons are stronger than upward dimensional comparisons, dimensional comparison processes in general contribute to an increase in students' academic self-concept (Pohlmann and M\u00f6ller 2009) .",

Regarding young elementary school children, validations of the I/E model are rather sparse (Faber 1992; M\u00f6ller et al. 2009 M\u00f6ller et al. , 2011a . However, at this stage of development, children typically claim that they are among the \"best in their class\" as they have difficulties in differentiating between actual and desired attributes and in using information from social comparisons adequately (Harter 1999) . Therefore, their self-evaluations are likely to be very positive but, unfortunately, also unrealistic (Eccles et al. 1993; Helmke 1999) . Certainly, elementary school children are able to report their self-perceptions and to discriminate between various facets of selfconcept from first grade onward (Marsh et al. 1991 (Marsh et al. , 2002 . Accordingly, children realize that they have relative strengths and weaknesses across different domains . However, due to these dimensional comparisons, the multiple dimensions of self-concept become more differentiated. Although some studies have explored the development of academic self-concepts in elementary school-aged children (Chapman and Tunmer 1997; Guay et al. 2003; Helmke and van Aken 1995; Marsh et al. 1991 , it remains an open question from which grade onward dimensional comparison effects exist. Findings from third and fourth grade students indicate that dimensional effects may already exist at the end of elementary school, but no information is available so far about the first years of elementary school (Faber 1992; M\u00f6ller et al. 2009 M\u00f6ller et al. , 2011a .",

These skills are central to the early school education. Thus, we assume that these skills represent salient sources of information for intra-individual comparison processes. More precisely, we expect to find three distinct self-concept factors. The second goal was to analyze the I/E model in the first 3 years of elementary school to determine the onset of the dimensional effects predicted by the model. Specifically, we examined the hypothesis provided by Harter (1999) that a greater differentiation among self-perceptions emerges at about 8 years of age. The third goal was to analyze the relationship of achievement indicators and self-concept factors within the verbal domain. Therefore, we examined the influence of reading achievement on writing selfconcept and writing achievement on reading self-concept. Specifically, we directly addressed the impact these two skills have on the corresponding and non-corresponding self-concept facets. Because dimensional comparisons can also lead to assimilation effects (M\u00f6ller and Marsh 2013) and reading and writing are taught simultaneously in the subject German and are closely related and influenced by each other (Abbott et al. 2010) , we predicted positive paths for reading achievement on writing self-concept as well as for writing achievement on reading self-concept.",

For reading, writing, and math, we used responses to six positively worded items on a seven-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 1=very poor to 7=very good, with higher values indicating higher self-concepts). The points of the scale were illustrated via small stick figures (instead of digits) representing classmates. The children's task was to label one of the stick figures representing their own capabilities. In each scale, one of the six items required explicit social comparison processes (e.g., \"In reading, I am the worst/best\"). The items reflected evaluative (\"In reading, I am not gifted/very gifted\") as well as emotional (\"Reading is no fun/a lot of fun\") beliefs about one's academic achievement (Burnett 1994) . For group administration purposes, each child was given a copy of the self-concept questionnaire. The experimenter read the instructions aloud, presented two sample items, and then answered questions before presenting the questionnaire. In grades 1 and 2, every single item was read aloud to the students.",

Because this statistic is known to be highly sensitive to sample size, we also used several commonly recommended descriptive measures of model fit (Hu and Bentler 1998) : the standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) as well as the comparative fit index (CFI). Models were evaluated as fitting well when the baseline fit indices (SRMR and RMSEA) were <0.08 and the incremental fit index (CFI) was 0.95 or larger.

These constraints provided a much poorer fit, indicating that the influence of reading achievement on writing self-concept is not identical to the influence of writing achievement on reading self-concept. Although reading achievement had a significantly larger effect on reading self-concept than writing achievement (M9), no significant change in model fit was found when constraining the path of writing achievement on writing self-concept and the path of writing achievement on reading self-concept to be equal (M10).

Consistent with other studies on age-related differences in the self-concept achievement relation, the associations were stronger in higher grades (Eccles et al. 1993; Helmke 1999; Marsh et al. 1991 ). In particular, the impact of writing achievement on writing selfconcept was relatively small in grade 1. Although alternative interpretations are possible, we think that this is partly due to first graders not being familiar with writing, especially with spelling. While children are somehow already confronted with reading and math in kindergarten (e.g., math or letter games), they usually do not become familiar with writing before elementary school. However, third graders seem to have acquired a selfperception of their writing capability that is as realistic and accurate as their reading and math self-concepts.",

Significant negative paths between reading and math were not found before grade 3, although the significance level at grade 2 was only marginally missed. Therefore, we assume that children use their selfperceived accomplishments in one academic area as basis for forming their self-concepts in another academic area in the course of grade 3. Although children can compare the different abilities earlier on, the contrasting comparisons seem to start around this age. This interpretation is consistent with Harter's (1999) suggestion that greater differentiation among selfperceptions occurs at about 8 years of age. Hence, our results are compatible with the assumption of a gradual developmental trend of increasing differentiation between math and verbal self-concepts during elementary school years (Marsh et al. 1991) . Although a number of factors might contribute to this phenomenon, the tradition in German elementary schools to begin grading at the end of grade 2 may trigger the effectiveness of dimensional comparisons, as students from this point in time not only receive information about the capabilities of their classmates, but also about their own capabilities in the different domains. However, these dimensional comparison processes seem to be limited to the relationship between reading and math. Contrary to the prediction of the I/E model, we did not find a significant negative impact of writing achievement on math self-concept or of math achievement on writing self-concept. Thus, children seem to disregard their perceived writing achievement when judging their math skills. Hence, children at this stage of development might particularly perceive reading rather than writing as the core verbal domain. In kindergarten, reading and math already appear as different domains (e.g., reading corner, number games); hence, the specificity of students' capability beliefs (M\u00f6ller et al. 2006a) may refer more strongly to these domains. The acquisition of writing, however, is not achieved before elementary school, with the consequence that this domain perhaps plays a minor role in dimensional comparison processes.",

This is due to the fact that the I/E model was mainly used to explain contrast effects, although assimilation effects are also possible in dimensional comparisons (M\u00f6ller and Marsh 2013) . However, the question of whether students really contrast different skills and school subjects seems to be influenced by various factors and contextual conditions. For example, the number of domains and subjects, which have to be compared, seem to affect dimensional comparison processes (Brunner et al. 2010) . When a limited number of academic domains is considered, the empirical relations correspond exactly to what was predicted by the I/E model (e.g., Marsh et al. 1988) . However, when a broader spectrum of school subjects is considered, the verbal and math domains are mostly substantively correlated (Marsh 1990b) . As a consequence, one could argue that contrast effects might only be found in situations where two significantly different domains are compared. Moreover, as Rost et al. (2004) showed, the contrast effect between the verbal and math domains is stronger the more the student's achievements differ in the corresponding areas. If students achieve identical outcomes in corresponding areas, contrasting dimensional comparison processes are less obvious. This corroborates the view that dimensional contrast effects in self-concepts are less likely in similar domains compared to domains which are per se more distinctive (Dickh\u00e4user 2003) . However, dimensional contrast effects between writing and math cannot be excluded in elementary school. They may be found when only writing and math are compared (Faber 1992) or writing is related in the self-concept test instructions to one language (e.g., German).",

While Marsh and Yeung (2001) found negative associations between different language subjects in secondary school students, no comparable associations were found in the present study. On the contrary, writing achievement even had a significant positive impact on the reading self-concept. Interestingly, this influence was rather similar to the influence of writing achievement on the writing self-concept (model 10). Nevertheless, reading achievement does not seem to contribute to the writing self-concept, as no significant relationship could be observed in this respect. At first glance, this differential pattern of results is somehow surprising, given that reading skill is held to be an important precondition of spelling (Jenkins et al. 2004) . Accordingly, we expected to find a positive path from reading achievement to the writing self-concept. However, differences in reading and spelling achievements might have caused this pattern of results. In German, the grapheme-phoneme correspondence is significantly higher than the phoneme-grapheme correspondence (Landerl and Wimmer 2008) . Therefore, despite the high correlation between reading and spelling, a good reader is not necessarily good at spelling (Bosman and van Orden 1997) . However, good spelling skills require good reading skills (Jenkins et al. 2004) . Consequently, while high levels in spelling skills are associated with rather positive writing and reading self-concepts, high levels of reading achievement are not necessarily associated with strong writing self-concepts.",

Any causal interpretations, even though based on relevant theories, have, thus, to be treated with caution. In order to analyze effects of achievement indicators on different selfconcept facets and the developmental trajectories of various self-concept facets and their interrelationships, longitudinal data are needed (see M\u00f6ller et al. 2011b) . Future studies should also include a broader scope of external validity criteria. For example, it would be interesting to investigate which pattern of results emerges when using school grades or differentiated teacher ratings of children's reading, writing, and math achievements. In addition, it would be worthwhile to measure general school aptitudes and general academic self-concept in order to test the nested Marsh/Shavelson model (Brunner et al. 2010 ) with elementary school children.",

Most studies dealing with writing estimate students corresponding capability by multiple measures like handwriting, composing, and spelling (Graham et al. 2012) . However, spelling is of particularly significance for later school achievement (Bos et al. 2007) , writing education targets spelling in particular, and spelling is closely related to the other components of writing (Berninger et al. 2002; Graham et al. 1997) . Moreover, our findings demonstrated the importance of this writing component for the writing self-concept, as well as the reading self-concept. Nevertheless, multiple achievement measures should be used in a latent variable approach to obtain a broader and more valid estimate of students writing achievement.",

First, the wording of items for the three facets of academic self-concept was not completely identical. Second, like other instruments in the field (e.g., SDQ; Marsh 1990a), the self-concept measure used in the present study assesses a broader capability than captured by the achievement indicators. Most achievement tests focus on specific capabilities like, for instance, the number of mistakes in a spelling test, whereas self-concept contains generalized estimations and emotional beliefs about one's own academic achievement in a specific but more general domain (Burnett 1994) . This difference in conceptualization may be especially relevant to the relation of writing self-concept and writing achievement because the latter had been implemented as a spelling test. However, two items of the writing self-concept focus strongly or rather directly on spelling (see Table 3 in the Appendix). Moreover, in the German language, the distinction between writing and spelling is less clear-cut than in English (writing is called \"Schreiben,\" whereas spelling is called \"Rechtschreiben\").",

More specifically, the results provide empirical support to conceptualizing distinct self-concept facets with regard to reading, writing, and math, even in elementary school children. Psychometrically, the factor structure was revealed to be relatively robust and generalizable across elementary school years. Thus, the verbal selfconcept appears to be more differentiated than assumed in previous studies with elementary school children. Moreover, the onset of dimensional comparisons as reflected in the dimensional contrast effect was demonstrated to be earlier than has been suggested before. Especially, math and reading achievements are perceived as more differentiated than they actually are.",

Our findings, especially the missing contrast effect between math and writing and the positive influence of writing achievement on reading self-concept as well as findings of other studies (e.g., Dickh\u00e4user 2003; M\u00f6ller et al. 2006b) , support this interpretation.
