The REM suggests that domain-specific academic self-concept and achievement are reciprocally related, with prior academic self-concept positively influencing subsequent achievement, and prior achievement positively influencing subsequent academic self-concept. The I/EM suggests that mathematics achievement (MACH) and verbal achievement (VACH) have positive effects on self-concepts in the same domain, but that achievement has negative effects on non-corresponding self-concepts (e.g., from MACH to verbal self-concept [VSC] ). Finally, the RI/EM combines the two models, examines longitudinal data on achievement and academic self-concept in both domains, and in addition to the two established models, makes it possible to analyse the effects of self-concept on subsequent achievement in noncorresponding domains.",

These authors found that achievements assessed by school grades had negative longitudinal effects on self-concepts in non-corresponding domains thereby extending I/EM and REM predictions. The effects of self-concepts on subsequent achievements in non-corresponding domains were slightly negative. The main purpose of the present paper is to analyse the integration of I/EM and REM into the RI/EM when standardized achievement test scores are used as achievement measures as an important limitation of research on the RI/EM lies in the sole use of teacher-assigned grades as achievement indicators (M\u20ac oller et al., 2011) . Therefore, the present study tries to validate the RI/EM while extending it by also using standardized test scores as achievement indicators. This is particularly important as there is evidence that the type of achievement measure has moderating effects on the relationship between achievement and academic self-concept (see below).",

                "text": "The REM ( Figure 1a ) firstly postulates stability for both academic self-concept and within-domain achievement, and a positive relationship between them over time. Secondly, it postulates that subsequent achievement is affected by prior self-concept, and that subsequent self-concept is affected by prior achievement. The question as to which construct causally dominates the other is related to two different theoretical approaches, the self-enhancement and skill-development hypotheses (Calsyn & Kenny, 1977) . The self-enhancement hypothesis postulates that self-concept affects achievement via academic choice behaviour, higher motivation, effort, and investment (Marsh & Yeung, 1997) . The skill-development hypothesis suggests that achievement affects academic self-concept mostly explained by social comparison processes (e.g., M\u20ac oller & Pohlmann, 2010; M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) . Students tend to socially compare their achievement in a domain with the achievement of their classmates. As a consequence, students with an above-average achievement develop a high academic self-concept, whereas students with a below-average achievement develop a low academic self-concept. The theoretical integration of both hypotheses is the REM (Marsh, 1990; Marsh & Craven, 2006; Retelsdorf, K\u20ac oller, & M\u20ac oller, 2014) . The empirical research reveals evidence in favour of both the self-enhancement and the skill-development hypothesis. Nevertheless, in their meta-analysis of the self-enhancement hypothesis, Valentine et al. (2004) concluded that there was support for moderate to weak positive paths (0.11) from self-beliefs to later academic achievement within domains even when initial levels of achievement were controlled for. With respect to the skill-development hypothesis, in their meta-analysis of 69 studies, M\u20ac oller et al. (2009) found strong positive paths from achievement to the corresponding academic self-concept (math: Grades .75, tests: .57; verbal: Grades: .68, tests: .47 without controlling for prior academic self-concept).",

                "text": "The internal/external frame of reference model The I/EM (Figure 1b ) extends the relationship between academic self-concept and achievement to more than one domain. The I/EM firstly postulates positive paths from mathematics and VACH to the corresponding self-concepts (the same social comparison process using an external frame of reference as posited in the REM). Secondly, it postulates that achievement in one domain negatively affects self-concept in the non-corresponding domain: Students compare their achievements within an internal frame of reference, for example, in verbal domains with their achievements, for example, in mathematics domains. A student who is better in verbal than in mathematics tasks therefore contrasts his/her better VSC with his/her worse mathematics self-concept (MSC). In addition to social comparisons, these so-called dimensional comparisons (M\u20ac oller & K\u20ac oller, 2001a) have an impact on academic self-concept. M\u20ac oller and Marsh (2013) focused on these intra-individual comparisons in their dimensional comparison theory. Based on dimensional comparisons between one's own achievement in mathematics and in verbal domains, low MACH seems to lead to an increase in VSC. Together social and dimensional comparison processes lead to the moderate or near-zero correlations often observed between MSCs and VSCs (M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) . Empirical support for the validity of the I/EM comes from introspective (M\u20ac oller & Husemann, 2006) , experimental (M\u20ac oller, 2005; M\u20ac oller & K\u20ac oller, 2001a; , and field studies (Marsh & Hau, 2004; M\u20ac oller & K\u20ac oller, 2001b; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1992) . The meta-analysis of 69 I/E studies (M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) showed generalized support for the assumptions of the I/EM: MACH and VACH were highly correlated (.67), MSC and VSC were nearly uncorrelated (.10); paths from achievement to academic self-concept in the corresponding domain were substantial and positive (.61 for mathematics, .49 for verbal), and paths from achievement in one domain to academic self-concept in the other domain were substantial and negative (MACH to VSC: \u00c0.21; VACH to MSC: \u00c0.27). There were some substantial differences in these relations with achievements measured by teacher-assigned grades or by objective test scores (see below).",

As Marsh and K\u20ac oller (2004) have pointed out, combining the two models highlights the strengths of each model that are limitations of the other model. The REM proposes that academic self-concept has an effect on achievement and that achievement has an effect on academic self-concept, ignoring cross-domain effects. The I/EM only addresses the effects of achievement on academic self-concept, ignoring the effects of academic self-concept on achievement. The combination of the two models extends the I/EM by analysing the longitudinal effects of achievement on self-concept and of self-concept on achievement. It also extends the REM by analysing the reciprocal relationship between achievement and self-concept across domains. Overcoming the potential limitations of the REM and the I/ EM are the foci of the RI/EM. M\u20ac oller et al. (2011) found support for both the REM and the I/EM, even when prior achievement and self-concept indicators were controlled for. Using three waves of data collection from grade 5 to grade 8 with N = 1,508 students, analyses supported the REM, revealing that grades and academic self-concept had positive longitudinal effects on both subsequent grades and academic self-concept within domains. The I/EM found support as well; grades had negative effects on the subsequent academic self-concept across domains. The combination of the longitudinal measures of all four constructs made it possible to additionally test for the supposed small negative effect of prior academic self-concept in one domain on subsequent achievement in another domain. M\u20ac oller et al. (2011) as well as Niepel et al. (2014) found that academic self-concept only had small negative effects on subsequent grades across domains. This is in line with other studies testing for the longitudinal effects of academic self-concept on achievement in non-corresponding domains which have also reported either no significant effects (K\u20ac oller, Klemmert, M\u20ac oller, & Baumert, 1999; Marsh & Yeung, 1998; M\u20ac oller & K\u20ac oller, 2001b) or small negative effects (Marsh & K\u20ac oller, 2004) .

                "text": "Test scores and grades as achievement indicators and their relation to self-concept Teacher-assigned grades and standardized test results are the most important sources of feedback with regard to students' achievement. Both achievement indicators are interrelated but not congruent and both have far-reaching consequences for instructional practice, for the evaluation of students' performances, and individual students' academic careers and self-concepts. Nevertheless, there is some variance left between both achievement indicators. With regard to the RI/EM, a major difference between grades and test scores is their relation to self-concept. The relations are stronger when achievement is based on high-stakes school grades rather than low-stakes standardized tests (Hansford & Hattie, 1982; Marsh & Yeung, 1998; Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002) as low-stakes tests have no direct implications for students' present or future educational goals (Trautwein, L\u20ac udtke, Marsh, K\u20ac oller, & Baumert, 2006) . This is in line with the assumptions of both hypotheses underlying the REM, the self-enhancement hypothesis and the skill-development hypothesis. The self-enhancement hypothesis postulates that self-concept affects achievement via academic choice behaviour, higher motivation, effort, and investment (Marsh & Yeung, 1997) which is more important for high-stake grades than for low-stake test situations. Students have no opportunity and little incentive to study for low-stakes standardized tests. As Valentine et al. (2004) argue, it is to assume that self-concepts have a stronger impact on achievement aspects strongly related to motivation, such as teacher-assigned grades (Wylie, 1979) . However, in their meta-analysis, they found almost no differences between the effects of self-concepts on test scores and the effects of self-concepts on grades. Both were relatively small (between .08 and .10). The skill-development hypothesis suggests that students' social comparisons are responsible for the achievement influencing academic self-concept effect (e.g., M\u20ac oller & Pohlmann, 2010; M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) . The meta-analysis of studies on the I/EM (M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) revealed different patterns for different achievement indicators: whereas the I/EM fits both achievement measures, paths from achievement to self-concepts were stronger for grades than for test scores.",

(2004) dealt with cognitive ability as a moderator of relations between self-concept and achievement as limited cognitive ability may increase the importance of positive self-beliefs for subsequent achievement (for effects of cognitive ability on the I/EM see Chen, Hwang, Yeh, & Lin, 2011) . However, as with Hansford and Hattie (1982) , there was no moderating influence in their meta-analysis. Neither Hansford and Hattie (1982) nor Valentine et al. (2004 Valentine et al. ( ) or M\u20ac oller et al. (2009 found any gender differences in the relations between achievement and self-beliefs although theoretically, numerous personal characteristics such as sex stereotypes and school environment factors such as teachers' gender-related patterns of interaction with students (Eccles, 1983) might have differential effects on boys and girls. As Skaalvik and Rankin (1990) point out, girls may find it less important to do well in mathematics, whereas boys may attach less importance to VACH. As yet, however, there is little evidence that gender affects the patterns proposed by the RI/EM (Marsh, 1990; M\u20ac oller et al., 2009 Skaalvik & Rankin, 1990; Valentine et al., 2004) . In our particular sample, we analysed additional moderating effects of migration background and school type attended. Finally, students' domain-specific interest may serve as a potential moderator as interest may affect the perception of achievement: Students with higher interest in math than in verbal affairs may have stronger paths from math than from VACH on subsequent self-concepts although in Marsh, K\u20ac oller, Trautwein, L\u20ac udtke, and Baumert (2005) prior math interest had only a small effect on subsequent math self-concept. Pohlmann and M\u20ac oller (2006) in an experimental study on the I/EM revealed only small effects of social and dimensional comparisons on task-specific interest.",

These students were a subsample of the larger project EIKA (development and implementation of a school-to-work transition concept for schools serving disadvantaged communities), which addressed competence development among adolescents in schools with particular need for support. This project originally focused on the investigation of conditions and determinants of competencies among students from disadvantaged communities. The sample was drawn to represent an urban area that evidently performed poorly in international large-scale student assessments. It was characterized by a relatively high percentage of students from low-income families and a high percentage of students with an immigrant background. In this article, the investigated students of the subsample were fifth-graders from the first measurement point who were followed up to grade 9. They came from families characterized by a low socioeconomic status (as indicated by the Highest International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status [HISEI] of the mother and father from the parents' reports: M = 39, SD = 14 on a scale from 16 to 90 with higher scores indicating greater socioeconomic status; Ganzeboom & Treiman, 1996) . Fifty percentage of the sample comprised students with an immigration background according to country of birth as reported by the parents (or by the children when the parents' reports were not available): That is, at least one of the parents or the child was not born in Germany. After elementary school, in grade 5, German students are assigned to different types of secondary school based on their abilities and prior achievement (academic track Gymnasium or non-academic tracks). The majority of our sample (71%) attended non-academic track schools.",

In accordance with Little, Preacher, Selig, and Card (2007) , metric and scalar measurement invariance of latent variables are of critical importance in longitudinal designs. Invariance on the higher level is indicated by minimal changes in model fit indices (e.g., the chi-square statistic) when comparing the less restrictive model (e.g., factor loadings estimated freely) with the more restrictive model (e.g., factor loadings constrained to be equal over time), respectively. When using the robust maximum likelihood estimator and multiple imputations, correction factors are not available in Mplus to conduct a chi-square difference test for measurement invariance. Moreover, the use of a chi-square test for measurement invariance is questionable due to its sensitivity to sample size and violation to the normality assumption. As an alternative rule of thumb, changes in CFI < .01 and in RMSEA < .015 have been recommended for assuming invariance between a target model and a baseline model (Chen, 2007; Cheung & Rensvold, 2002) . In the present study, these criteria were clearly met (DCFI = .002 and .003 and DRMSEA = .003 and .001). Specifically, the goodness-of-fit indices for the models with ascending restrictiveness were as follows. The baseline modelassuming configural invariance with items allocated to specific factors but with loadings estimated freelyfit the data well, v 2 (42) = 317.893; CFI = .947; TLI = .916; RMSEA = .079; and SRMR = .039. The next restrictive modelassuming metric measurement invariance with factor loadings constrained to be equal over timefit the data equally well, v 2 (46) = 327.520; CFI = .945; TLI = .923; RMSEA = .076; and SRMR = .041. The more restrictive modelassuming scalar measurement invariance with the addition of item intercepts constrained to be equal over timefit the data equally well, v 2 (50) = 351.696; CFI = .942; TLI = .923; RMSEA = .075; and SRMR = .041. Based on the guidelines for model comparisons presented above, the requirement of metric and scalar invariance over time was supported for the self-concept factors. Factor loadings and item intercepts of the latent self-concept variables were thus held constant over time in all of the structural equation models analysed.",

Moreover, correlations of the domain-specific self-concepts at the second measurement point were significant for boys (in the RI/EM with grades: r = .35, p < .001, with test scores as achievement measures: r = .31, p < .001), but not for girls (in the RI/EM with grades: r = .06, p = .337, with test scores as achievement measures: r = .06, p = .371). There was only one significant difference in the RI/EM with respect to students' immigration background (Wald chi-square [1] = 4.272, p = .039): When using test scores as achievement measures, MACH and self-concept at the second measurement point were correlated among students with an immigration background (r = .26, p = .001), but not among students without an immigration background (r = .09, p = .205). More interestingly, several paths of the RI/EM with grades as achievement measures differed significantly between the attended school types. Both, mathematics grades (Wald chi-square [1] = 5.327, p = .021) and German grades (Wald chi-square [1] = 5.150, p = .023) were less stable in vocational track schools (math grade: b = .37, p < .001, German grade: b = .43, p < .001) compared with academic track schools (math grade: b = .53, p < .001, German grade: b = .51, p < .001). Moreover, the subject grades had smaller influences on the respective subsequent domain-specific self-concepts (in mathematics: Wald chi-square [1] = 8.607, p = .003, in verbal domain: Wald chi-square [1] = 4.084, p = .043) in vocational track schools (mathematics: b = .23, p < .001, verbal domain: b = .20, p < .001) than in academic track schools (mathematics: b = .46, p < .001, verbal domain: b = .34, p < .001). When using grades or test scores as achievement measures, there were no differences in the paths or correlations of the RI/EM with regard to students' general cognitive ability or their domain-specific interests in mathematics and German. There was thus no evidence for a moderation of the RI/EM by students' general cognitive ability and their domain-specific interests in German and mathematics, and merely negligible evidence for moderation by students' immigration background and sex. Nevertheless, some of the paths in the RI/EM with grades as achievement measures were moderated by the school type attended.",

As the present study and the meta-analysis of M\u20ac oller et al. 2009have shown, there are two main differences between the two ways of measuring achievement: the different correlations between mathematics and VACH and the different effects of prior achievements on subsequent corresponding self-concepts. Both correlations between mathematics and VACH are positive and significant, but the correlation was much higher for test scores than for teacher-assigned grades. This result corresponds with the results of former studies, inside and outside of self-concept research (Marsh & Hau, 2004) . Both effects from prior achievements to subsequent corresponding self-concepts are also positive but stronger for grades than for test scores. This result supports the assumption that students know their relative standing within their class and carry out social comparisons of their own grade with the grades of their classmates. Students make their grade instead of their test score the basis of their self-concept.",

In addition, our study dealt with mostly data from students on non-academic tracks. Therefore, although the conclusions should be primarily drawn for this group, there is some evidence that grades in both subjects more strongly affect self-concepts on the academic track than on the vocational track. As there is no such difference regarding the impact of test scores, it may be that grades are more important to students for self-evaluations who have higher educational aspirations.",

Such combining strategies may help clarify the relationship between achievement and academic self-concept. In our view, the most important result is that it matters how scholastic achievement is measured: Relations between verbal and math achievements, on the one hand, and within-domain relations between achievements and self-concepts, on the other hand, are quite different for test scores compared with teacher-assigned grades: test scores are more highly correlated than grades, whereas grades have higher within-domain correlations with self-concepts than test scores although based on a design flaw grades were collected 1 year after the self-concepts and achievement test scores. As grades are relatively stable over one school year, relations between grades and self-concepts may be underestimated to a certain degree in our study. This should be taken into account in the interpretation of our results.",

Compared with test scores, teacher-assigned grades are stronger predictors of students' motivational variables, but lack in their objectivity. On the other hand, test scores are more highly correlated with other objective data sources such as intelligence scores and are less biased by lack of teachers' accuracy in judgment (Kaiser, Retelsdorf, S\u20ac udkamp, & M\u20ac oller, 2013; S\u20ac udkamp et al., 2012) .
