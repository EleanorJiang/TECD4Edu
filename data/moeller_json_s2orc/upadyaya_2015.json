    "abstract": "This study investigated to what extent primary school teachers' perceptions of their students' ability and effort predict developmental changes in children's selfconcepts of ability in math and reading after controlling for students' academic performance and general intelligence. Three cohorts (N = 849) of elementary school children and their teachers were followed for four years. Children's selfconcepts and performance ability in math and reading were measured annually during Waves 2-4. Teachers rated the children's ability and effort at each of the four waves. Domain-specific differences and developmental changes could be identified in the associations between teachers' perceptions and children's ability self-concepts. Teachers' ability perceptions predicted children's concurrent and subsequent ability self-concepts in math and reading, whereas teachers' effort perceptions predicted children's math ability self-concept only at Wave 4. Analyses with multi-sample procedure showed that these models were similar for boys and girls and for children in different cohort groups.",

                "text": "Positive self-concept of ability in different domains is related to high academic learning and achievement (Eccles, Wigfield, & Schiefele, 1997) , and thus, is a widely valued educational goal (Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, K\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 2005) . At the beginning of primary school, children typically have high ability selfconcepts in various domains, which proceed to significantly decline over the school years (Aunola, Leskinen, Onatsu-Arvilommi, & Nurmi, 2002; Bouffard, Marcoux, Vezeau, & Bordeleau, 2003) . One possible cause for these declines is children's increased understanding of the evaluative feedback they receive from their teachers (Stipek & Iver, 1989) which is usually based on teachers' perceptions of the causes of children's performance (Graham, 1990) . Teachers may, for example, perceive high-achieving children as having high abilities (Holloway & Hess, 1985) , or believe that children with high academic motivation invest a great amount of effort in their schoolwork (Upadyaya, Viljaranta, Lerkkanen, Poikkeus, & Nurmi, 2012) . Children, in turn, assimilate teachers' perceptions into their self-perceptions, which may further show in their ability self-concepts in different domains (Rosenholtz & Simpson, 1984; Tiedemann, 2000) . However, to the authors' knowledge, no studies exist examining these associations over the primary school years. Consequently, the present longitudinal study investigates the extent to which teachers' ability and effort perceptions predict the ontogeny and development of children's math/reading ability self-concepts from kindergarten through sixth grade. To isolate the predictive role of teachers' perceptions, children's report card marks and standardised scores of general knowledge at the beginning of the study were controlled for in the analyses.",

These changes reflect the development of children's ability to make social comparisons and to integrate performance feedback over time in service of fine tuning one's ability self-concepts (Bouffard, Markovits, Vezeau, Boisvert, & Dumas, 1998) , as well as declines in the children's engagement and performance in different domains (Chapman & Tunmer, 1997; Denissen, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2007; Helmke & van Aken, 1995; Herbert & Stipek, 2005; Marsh, 1990; Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004) . In addition, during the early elementary school years, children are sensitive to the perceptions and feedback of their teachers (Graham, 1990; Spinath & Spinath, 2005) whose evaluations, depending on their content, are further positively or negatively reflected in children's academic motivation and performance (Natale, Viljaranta, Lerkkanen, Poikkeus, & Nurmi, 2009) .",

It has been suggested that teachers' and parents' gender-stereotypic perceptions of children are partially responsible for these differences (Frome & Eccles, 1998; Herbert & Stipek, 2005; Jacobs & Eccles, 2000) . Girls may also have lower self-concept in some academic domains because they are more sensitive than boys to others' evaluative feedback (Jussim, Eccles, & Madon, 1996) . In the present study, we investigated this further. Based on the previous literature, we expected that children's ability self-concepts would slightly decrease over the primary school years and that boys would show higher self-concept of math ability than girls, whereas girls would show higher self-concept of reading ability than boys. Moreover, we expected that younger children would show higher self-concept of math and reading ability than older children.",

                "text": "Teachers' perceptions concerning their students' achievement have typically been investigated in the framework of the attributional theory of motivation (Weiner, 1985 (Weiner, , 1986 and the expectancy-value model of motivation (Eccles et al., 1983; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . According to the attributional theory of motivation internal explanations, such as ability and effort, are especially important in motivating children to do well at school (Weiner, 1994) . Teachers' perceptions of children's ability and effort are similar to each other in that they are both internal qualities of a child (Weiner, 1985 (Weiner, , 1986 . However, they are different in the dimensions of controllability and stability (Weiner, 1985 (Weiner, , 1986 . For example, a child cannot control the amount of his/her 'innate' ability, but can easily control and change the amount of effort he/she puts into tasks (Weiner, 1994) . Moreover, one can employ an entity view of abilities (e.g. perceiving abilities as a fixed trait) or an incremental view of abilities (e.g. perceiving abilities as malleable) (Dweck & Leggett, 1988) . Incremental view of abilities is typically perceived as more beneficial for learning, however, in classrooms where gender stereotypes are low students may feel that they can better demonstrate their high abilities and continue employing and entity view of their abilities (Good, Rattan, & Dweck, 2012) . According to the expectancy-value model of motivation (Eccles et al., 1983; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) , teachers are significant socialisers whose perceptions impact children's ability self-concepts and academic motivation (Madon et al., 2001 ). Teachers' perceptions are typically communicated to children indirectly through teachers' feedback, emotional responses (Butler, 1994; Georgiou, Christou, Stavrinides, & Panaoura, 2002) and classroom practices (Stipek, Givvin, Salmon, & MacGyvers, 2001 ). For example, when teachers have high expectations for a student, they typically express more praise to him/her and provide the student with more challenging materials, which, in turn, predicts increase in a student's expectations of his/her future competence (Kuklinski & Weinstein, 2001; Pallas, Entwisle, Alexander, & Stluka, 1994; Parsons, Kaczala, & Meece, 1982) . Teachers are often unaware of the subtle cues that communicate their beliefs during teacher-student interaction (Graham, 1984) . For example, a teacher's pity towards a failing student may indicate to the child that he/she lacks the ability to succeed (Georgiou et al., 2002) , which may further show as a decrease in his/her ability self-concept. Moreover, teachers' perceptions are typically more accurate and objective (Jussim & Harber, 2005 ) than parents' perceptions (K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen & R\u00e4ty, 2010) because children move from one teacher to another every year, whereas parents may share the same perceptual biases with their children over the school years.",

However, according to some studies, teachers' (Natale et al., 2009) and parents' (Rytk\u00f6nen, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2007) perceptions predict children's motivation more often than children's motivational constructs predict teachers' or parents' perceptions. This may occur because, particularly during the early elementary school years children assimilate teachers' perceptions into their own ability self-concepts (Rosenholtz & Simpson, 1984; Tiedemann, 2000) and teachers' expectations concerning children's future performance and achievement come to be reflected in children's expectations for their own achievement (Herbert & Stipek, 2005; Kuklinski & Weinstein, 2001 ).",

Boys' success is often attributed to ability and girls' success to effort, especially in math (Madon et al., 1998; Tiedemann, 2002) , and teachers give girls more often than boys feedback related to the intellectual quality of their work (Dweck, Davidson, Nelson, & Enna, 1978) . Similarly, in Western cultures a common belief is that mathematical performance is more strongly linked to natural talent than reading (Dweck, 2008; Stipek, 1984) . Moreover, because older children have a better understanding of the inverse association of ability and effort with outcomes, they are more likely than younger children to understand that high effort does not necessarily indicate high abilities and that success in more difficult tasks require higher ability (Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Nicholls, 1978) . Thus, the present study examined the possible age, gender and subject area differences in the associations between teachers' perceptions, and students' ability self-concepts and performance across time. We expected that teachers' perceptions of ability would predict children's ability self-concepts especially in math, and that teachers' effort perceptions would predict children's ability self-concepts especially towards the end of the primary school. Moreover, children's performance in math and reading were expected to positively predict their ability self-concepts.",

The sample consists of 849 children who attended school in Southeastern Michigan and their teachers; in the first wave, 240 were kindergarteners (118 girls, 122 boys), 246 were first graders (126 girls, 120 boys) and 363 were third grades (189 girls, 174 boys). The number of schools varied from 8 to 16 between the Waves, and most attrition was due to the school transitions and children moving out from the school district (77% of the children were present at all measurement times). There were 102 teachers at Wave 1, 81 at Wave 2, 127 at Wave 3 and 125 at Wave 4; the vast majority of teachers were female, white and had elementary school teaching credentials. The majority of the children were from middle-class backgrounds, and 92.3% of the children were European American (2.5% were Asian-American, 1.9% Arab, 1.4% African-American, 1.2% Asian-Indian, .5% Hispanic and .2% were American Indian children).",

The analyses were carried out in four steps. First, to investigate the extent to which children's ability self-concepts would change across time, LGMs were carried out separately for children's math/reading ability self-concepts. The observed values of the composite scores for children's self-concepts at Wave 2, Wave 3 and Wave 4 were specified as a growth model. In these models, the mean level of the selfconcepts (intercept), their average growth (slope) and individual variation across these scores were estimated. Intercept was specified by setting the loadings of the three observed values of the self-concepts to 1, and slope was specified by setting the loadings of the three observed values of the self-concepts to 0, 1 and 2, assuming a linear growth with equal spacing of assessments over time. The residual variances of the observed variables were allowed to be freely estimated.",

Similarly, children's math/reading performance report card marks were added to the models as time-varying covariates. Two models were constructed separately for children's ability self-concepts in math and reading. Time-varying effects were specified by adding a path from teachers' ability and effort perceptions and from children's math/reading performance at each wave to the observed value of selfconcept at the same wave. In addition, cross-paths from previous years' teachers' perceptions and from children's performance at Wave 2 and Wave 3 to children's subsequent ability self-concepts were included for the Wave 3 and Wave 4. All the endogenous variables were allowed to covary. Moreover, because the teachers were rating the same students each year, teachers' perceptions for the same children were allowed to correlate with each other over time. Similarly, children's math/reading performance variables were allowed to correlate over time. A basic model of the study is presented in Figure 1 . To further examine the nesting of children in different classrooms taught by different teachers, cross-sectional multi-level models were also carried out. The results of the cross-sectional multi-level models were similar to the ones presented here (see also Upadyaya & Eccles, in press b) .

As expected, teachers' ratings of each of their students' innate abilities positively predicted children's concurrent and subsequent ability self-concepts in math and reading and across the school years. In contrast, low teacher ratings of students' math/reading abilities predicted declines in children's ability self-concepts. Similar results has been reported in kindergarten (Upadyaya et al., 2012) , however, our results add to the previous findings by showing that teachers' ability perceptions contribute also to the development of children's ability self-concepts longitudinally over the primary school years. It is possible that when teachers perceive children as having high abilities, they praise children for their personal traits which might increase children's feelings of self-worth and predict positively their self-concept of ability (see also Covington, 1984; Kamins & Dweck, 1999) . Teachers' ability perceptions may also enforce children's expectations concerning their future competence which may be incorporated into higher ability self-concepts (Eccles et al., 1983) . Moreover, these results suggested that primary school classrooms may have relatively low gender stereotypic atmosphere where children feel they can perform up to their potential, have high ability selfconcepts and high sense of belonging even when teachers would be employing entity views of intelligence (see also Good et al., 2012) . Teachers' concurrent effort perceptions, in turn, positively predicted children's Wave 4 ability self-concept in math, controlling for prior ability self-concepts and performance. These results may reflect the developmental changes in children's cognitive capacities and understanding the concepts of academic abilities and effort (Aunola et al., 2002; Bouffard et al., 1998) : At the beginning of their primary school, children usually believe that high effort equals to high abilities, however, later on they begin to understand that it takes more effort to do well if one has less abilities (Nicholls, 1978) , which in our study showed as a lack of associations between teachers' effort perceptions and children's ability self-concepts. However, towards the end of the primary school children already know that both abilities and effort are required for academic success (Nicholls, 1978) , which may explain the Wave 4 association between teachers' effort perceptions and children's self-concept.",

For example, success in math is generally thought to be more due to aptitude or abilities than effort (Stipek, 1984) , and it might be easily reinforced both by ability and effort perceptions of the teacher. Success in reading, especially at the beginning of primary school, may require more hard work as beginning readers have to put a lot of effort in their tasks to acquire the needed skills. Therefore, children may feel that as they have to work hard in literacy they might not have the related abilities (Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Eccles et al., 1983) . However, when teachers have confidence in children's abilities in reading, children can easily maintain a positive self-concept of reading ability. Moreover, the goals of education in the primary grades typically focus on meeting basic benchmarks in math and reading; not reaching these benchmarks at specific grade levels is perceived as having academic problems. It is typically expected that all children can reach these levels, and thus more attention is put on the role of abilities than effort which may partly explain these results.",

In line with the expectancy-value model, these results suggested that teachers are important socialisers whose beliefs are often shown in children's expectations and academic motivation (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . However, differences exist according to the content of teachers' beliefs, and our results showed that teachers' perceptions of children's high effort in math/reading did not operate according to classic expectancy effects. It is possible that these differences in expectancy effects are explained by other factors, such as cultural views of effort and ability in various domains and children's age and developmental stage. As expected, during the elementary school years math performance played an important role in forming children's ability self-concepts. Similar findings have been reported previously (e.g. Marsh, 1990; Marsh et al., 2005) . However, as children's ability self-concepts become more stable, specific performance information may have less impact on change over time. The results for children's ability self-concepts in reading suggested that teachers' perceptions of children's reading abilities had a stronger effect on children's ability self-concept than their actual grades. This may be due the fact that teachers' ability perceptions may increase children's feelings of self-worth (see also Covington, 1984; Kamins & Dweck, 1999) , and suggest that in some cases, teachers' perceptions of children's reading abilities may measure children's reading ability self-concepts better than their actual grades.",

First, it is possible that teachers' perceptions predicted children's self-concepts of ability simply because they are accurate (Jussim & Harber, 2005) . Second, other variables that were not studied here may have contributed to the results of the present study. For example, previous studies have shown that general social classroom climate moderates the ways teachers' expectations and perceptions are communicated to children, and may have a different impact on children's self-concept according to the classroom type (see also Patrick, Anderman, Ryan, Edelin, & Midgley, 2001) . Moreover, children's own perceptions of their abilities and effort might have contributed to their ability self-concepts (Nicholls, 1978) . Third, children's maturity might have played a role in their responses to the selfconcept questionnaire as well as in teachers' perceptions (Rosenholtz & Simpson, 1984) , and some teachers might have perceived more mature children as having higher abilities. Fourth, teachers contributed both to the data concerning their perceptions and children's grades, which might have impacted the variation of these variables. However, when the teacher-level variation was controlled for in the additional cross-sectional analyses, the results remained similar to those reported here. Fifth, most of the children of the present study came from a middle-class white background, thus the results can be generalised only to this group. Similar work needs to be done on other ethnic/racial and social class groups and other cultures.",

Teachers should be aware of the developmental changes that occur in children's understanding of academic abilities and effort (see also Nicholls, 1978) and give children age-appropriate feedback concerning their innate talents and hard work which would the best support children's academic motivation and learning. Especially when the children get older, teachers can give their students more confidence by helping them to focus on the process of learning and by helping their students to maintain a growth mind-set of their abilities (Dweck, 2007) . Moreover, it is likely that children perceive the importance of innate ability versus effort differently across domains, and thus are likely to react differently to teachers' perceptions of their abilities and efforts in various subjects. Children are also likely to respond differently depending on whether they are doing well or doing poorly, and whether they are responding to teachers', parents' or peers perceptions. Finally, it is also possible that differences exist in the ways teachers' ability and effort perceptions predict the various aspects of children's academic motivation (e.g. ability self-concept, interest in different domains). For example, some studies have shown that teachers' perceptions of effort predict children's math interest more often than teachers' perceptions of ability (Upadyaya & Eccles, in press a). Future studies are needed to study these associations further.",
