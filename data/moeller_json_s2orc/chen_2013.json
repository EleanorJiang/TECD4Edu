A positive academic self-concept is beneficial, particularly for motivating individuals to improve their academic performance (Marsh, 2007) . Both the reciprocal-effects model (Marsh, Byrne, & Yeung, 1999) and the internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model (Marsh, 1986) depict the relationship between academic self-concept and achievement. The former model proposes that academic achievement and selfconcept reciprocally influence each other, while the latter model claims that achievement positively affects an individual's academic self-concept in the same domain but negatively affects self-concepts in other domains. Marsh and K\u00f6ller (2004) unified the two models to simultaneously address the causal relationships between academic self-concept and achievement across distinct domains. In the present article, we use \"the unification model\" (Chien, Jen, & Chang, 2008) to describe this model.",

However, the unification model has only been studied in German adolescents (Marsh & K\u00f6ller, 2004) .

To provide external validity and to gain insight into the causal relationships of academic selfconcepts and achievement within domains or cross-domains, the present study evaluated the unification model using a research design that combined the advantages of cross-sectional and longitudinal research within the same study (Marsh et al., 1999) .

According to the self-enhancement model, academic self-concept is a determinant of academic achievement, and enhancing academic self-concept improves academic performance. In contrast, the skill-development model suggests that academic self-concept is a consequence of achievement, and the best way to enhance academic self-concept is to improve achievement skills. Both the self-enhancement and skill-development models are based on either-or logic (Marsh, 2007) . A compromise between the self-enhancement model and the skill-development model is the reciprocal-effects model: prior academic self-concept affects subsequent achievement and prior achievement affects subsequent academic self-concept. Research studies have provided support for the reciprocal-effects model (Marsh & Yeung, 1997; Marsh et al., 1999) .",

According to Marsh (1990b) , the academic selfconcepts of young children are not highly associated with external indicators, such as grades or teachers' ratings. However, as they grow older, children learn their relative strengths and weaknesses such that domain self-concepts become more differentiated and more highly correlated with external indicators. In an evaluation of domain self-concept, Marsh, Craven, and Debus (1998) reported that the reliability, stability, and factor structure of academic self-concept scales improved as children grew older, indicating that academic self-concepts become more firmly established and stable with age. Skaalvik and Hagtvet (1990) also advocated that the relationship between achievement and academic self-concept likely becomes reciprocal when ability perceptions are well developed. Researchers supporting this developmental perspective include Skaalvik (1997) and Chapman and Tunmer (1997) . Chapman, Tunmer, and Prochnow (2000) noted that academic self-concept is developed based on previous experiences with learning; not all young children's academic self-concepts are pre-determinants of subsequent achievement.",

In contrast to previous research (Chapman & Tunmer, 1997; Skaalvik, 1997) , Guay et al. (2003) reported the existence of a link from prior academic self-concept to subsequent achievement for young elementary children. Another study of elementary school students found a reciprocal relationship between academic achievement and self-concept, although the effect of academic achievement on academic selfconcept was stronger than the effect of academic self-concept on academic achievement (Muijs, 1997) . Helmke and van Aken (1995) also supported the reciprocal-effects model when either test scores, school marks, or a mixture of the two were used as achievement indicators for elementary-school students.",

When the generalizability of the I/E model was examined longitudinally, it was found to be stable over time (Marsh et al., 2001) . Experimental studies that manipulated the feedback to an individual's mathematics and verbal performances also supported the existence of internal comparison (M\u00f6ller & Husemann, 2006; M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001; . Marsh and K\u00f6ller (2004) combined the reciprocal-effects model and the I/E model into a unified model that incorporates the strengths of each model. In the past, tests of the I/E model have typically been based on a single wave of data, which focuses on the influences of mathematics and verbal achievement on mathematics and verbal self-concepts, particularly the negative effect of achievement in one domain on self-concept in the other. However, the reciprocal-effects model has typically been studied based on a single academic domain. Even for studies that evaluated causal models for more than one domain, separate analyses were conducted for each domain (Marsh & Yeung, 1997; Shavelson & Bolus, 1982) . Therefore, the potential limitations of each model have been compensated by reconciling the reciprocal-effects model and the I/E model.",

In Taiwan, the academic self-concepts of 5th grade students and 10th grade students are at different stages of formation. Students in 5th grade experience little academic pressure, while 10th grade students have taken a competitive high school entrance exam and have begun to prepare for a college entrance exam that they will take in two years. Comparing these two groups provided insights into how students develop academic self-concepts at two different stages of schooling and the extent to which academic self-concept and achievement reciprocally influenced each other.",

In contrast, the effect of prior Chinese self-concept on subsequent Chinese achievement was weaker for Cohort 1 (b = .02) than Cohort 2 (b = .12). A similar pattern was observed for mathematics. Thus, the effect of academic achievement declined with age, whereas the effect of academic self-concept increased with age. Chapman et al. (2000) reported that negative and positive academic self-concepts better predicted subsequent reading skills compared to the average academic self-concept, and that the predictive power of academic self-concept for subsequent achievement differed across subgroups, of students with different academic selfconcepts. For elementary school students, the study findings indicated that prior Chinese self-concept did not influence subsequent Chinese achievement. A supplemental analysis of the data in the present study further analyzed the causal relationship of Chinese self-concept to Chinese achievement. Fifth grade students with Time 1 Chinese grades in the middle 50% were divided into two groups (the highest 25% and lowest 25% of the subsample) based on their Chinese self-concept ratings at Time 1. A comparison of the two groups at Time 2 found no significant difference in the Chinese grades of the two groups [t(99) = .34, p = .73]. Therefore, for preadolescents in Taiwan, average students who exhibited higher or lower Chinese self-concepts achieved similar grades in Chinese in the following year, supporting the finding that prior self-concept in Chinese did not influence subsequent Chinese achievement.",

However, because their study did not examine younger, elementary school students, investigations that included preadolescents were crucial to provide a more comprehensive understanding of reciprocal effects. The results of the present study found inconclusive evidence of reciprocal effects in older elementary school students because a reciprocal relationship was found for mathematics but not for Chinese.

Dai (2002) noted that because students consider mathematics achievement to be more important for success than Chinese achievement, they appear to develop a stable mathematics self-concept more quickly than a Chinese self-concept. We believe that the parental influence plays an important role in this process. Parents in Taiwan emphasize mathematics achievement because it is considered valuable for future job seekers. As a result, parents and schools focus more on mathematics learning, and their feedback regarding mathematics performance is more salient for students compared to performance in Chinese. Research has indicated that parents' values and expectations are more influential for children's learning in Confucian Asian countries than in Western countries (Kim & Park, 2006; Wang & Lin, 2005) , and children usually adopt parents' expectations and values due to the desire to maintain harmonious relationships with their parents. These cultural factors might explain why the domain differences in reciprocal effects have been reported less often in Western countries. Further in-depth investigations are needed to confirm differences in reciprocal effects for the mathematics and verbal academic domains.",

The I/E model and the cross-effects leading from academic self-concept For the I/E model incorporated into the unification model, the analysis found that although there was a negative cross-effect of mathematics achievement on subsequent Chinese self-concept in the elementary school sample, academic achievement did not affect academic self-concept in the other academic domain in the high-school sample. These results partially supported the claims of the I/E model. However, negative cross-domain effects for the longitudinal data were found when the effects of other constructs (e.g., the self-concept of the same domain in Time 1) were excluded from the model. This finding suggests that the proposed weak and negative cross-domain effects of prior achievement found for the I/E model were not strong enough to account for the variance of subsequent measures of academic self-concepts shared with more predominantly influential predictors. Future research should replicate this result because findings of the Marsh and K\u00f6ller's (2004) study supported the model integrating the I/E model with the reciprocal effects model. However, future research investigating differences between the Marsh and K\u00f6ller (2004) findings and results of the present study should also examine an additional factor. Marsh and K\u00f6ller's study, which was based on five waves of data collection with brief intervals separating the first four waves that occurred at the end of Grade 6 and the beginning, middle, and end of Grade 7, did not find significant cross-domain path coefficients for achievement between the end of 6th grade and the end of 7th grade. These results suggest that cross-domain effects diminish as the interval between Time 1 and Time 2 increases. The collinearity of the constructs across different waves might also decrease the predictive power of the same construct measured during the later waves. Therefore, future investigations of cross-domain effects should investigate the effect of differences in the time interval between waves.",

First, the current investigation is one of the few studies (Marsh et al., 2002) investigating the reciprocal effects of academic achievement and self-concept in an East Asian sample. The study found reciprocal effects for high school students in the academic areas of mathematics and Chinese, indicating that prior academic achievement affected subsequent academic self-concept and that prior academic self-concept influenced academic achievement in adolescents. Mixed results were found for preadolescents. Although reciprocal effects were found for mathematics, study findings supported the skill-developmental model for Chinese, which indicated that the causal relationship between academic self-concept and achievement for preadolescents depended on the academic area. Second, the effect of prior achievement on subsequent self-concept was stronger for preadolescents than for adolescents, whereas the effect of prior self-concept on subsequent achievement was stronger for adolescents than for preadolescents. In other words, the causal effect of academic achievement declined with age, whereas the causal effect of self-concept increased with age, revealing a developmental progression for reciprocal effects. Finally, a more complex longitudinal investigation based on the unification model revealed weaker negative cross-domain effects of prior achievement on subsequent self-concept.",

                "text": "The findings of the reciprocal-effects model have important implications for educators in classroom settings. Enhancing academic self-concepts will not produce lasting effects on academic achievement unless students are also able to maintain good grades. However, academic achievement based on increasing learning in an academic domain will not persist unless the student's academic self-concept is maintained. Therefore, as Marsh et al. (2005) suggest, academic achievement and self-concept should both be fostered. Approaches to fostering achievement and self-concepts should be sensitive to students' age due to the developmental progression of the causal ordering of achievement and self-concept. Teachers of elementary school students should focus on improving students' academic skills to enhance their academic self-concepts and influence future academic achievement. As students reach adolescence, enhancing students' academic self-concepts by improving achievement might be less feasible because academic self-concepts become more stable and less influenced by prior achievement. Moreover, although students who perform well in one domain are typically considered to have good academic self-concepts in all domains and students who perform poorly in one domain are considered to have poor academic self-concepts in all domains, teachers should not assume that academic self-concepts are equivalent across domains (Marsh & K\u00f6ller, 2004) . The I/E model suggests that students who perform well in mathematics may nevertheless have poorer mathematics self-concepts if they perceive that their verbal ability is greater than that of mathematics. Predicting domain self-concept from ability in the domain tends to be more accurate when ability in the other domain is also considered. Although academic self-concept is not stable for preadolescents, the influence of internal comparisons could persist during the school year. Teachers should be aware of the information based on internal comparisons (Dickh\u00e4user, 2005) and continually assess the extent to which their impression of a student's ability in a given academic area is accurate.",
