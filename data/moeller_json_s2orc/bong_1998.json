The other was to test underlying assumptions of the I/E model with frame-specific academic self-concepts.

Of particular interest has been the separation between verbal and math self-concepts. Unlike verbal and math achievements, which were almost always highly correlated, verbal and math self-concepts often displayed a nonsignificant or consider-ably weaker association (e.g., Byrne & Shavelson, 1986; Marsh et aL, 1988; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) . Marsh (1986) proposed the I/E frames of reference model to explain this phenomenon. He argued that students gauge their academic self-concept by comparing their ability in the area to their peers' ability in the same area (i.e., external comparison) and to their own ability in the other area (i.e., internal comparison). When the two processes operate simultaneously, a negative correlation between verbal and math self-concepts from the internal comparison cancels out a positive correlation from the external comparison. Further, achievement in one area negatively influences self-concept in the other area because a high self-concept in a given area requires good skills in the area (i.e., favorable external comparison) that are better than skills in competing areas (i.e., favorable internal comparison).",

                "text": "Self-Efficacy Formation Social cognitive researchers argued that there is an important difference between self-concept and self-efficacy judgments. According to Zimmerman (1995) , self-concept tends to emphasize normative assessment of ability (e.g., being better than others), whereas self-efficacy judgments stress mastery criteria (e.g., being able to succeed). The reiativistic comparison processes prescribed by the I/E model, therefore, are expected to play only a limited role in self-efficacy formation. In fact, Skaalvik and Rankin (1990) found only partial support for the I/E model with measures of academic self-efficacy. A strong positive correlation (.65) was observed between verbal and math self-efficacy. Only verbal achievement yielded a significant negative effect (-.36) on math self-efficacy for girls. When Marsh, Walker, and Debus (1991) included both academic self-concept and self-efficacy in their study, all of the I/E model's predictions were confirmed with self-concept, whereas none of the predictions was upheld with self-efficacy (see also Skaalvik & Rankin, 1995a , 1995b .",

All the problems selected were thought to be independent of any one particular text or instructional method. They also lent themselves to judging academic selfefficacy more easily than others. To rule out the possibility of obtaining different results because of the order of presentation, problems were randomly interspersed with each other at the time of their presentation.",

Specifically, verbal and math achievement factors were linked to verbal and math academic self-efficacy. Both verbal and math academic self-efficacy were second-order factors based on subject-specific first-order factors. English, Spanish, and American history academic self-efficacy factors were loaded on the second-order verbal academic self-efficacy, whereas algebra, geometry, and chemistry Note. Responses for subject-specific academic self-efficacy were based on a 100-point scale ranging from not sure (0) to real sure (100) in 10-unit intervals. Responses for frame-specific academic self-concepts were based on a 7-point scale ranging from very poor (1) to very good (7), academic self-efficacy factors were loaded on the secondorder math academic self-efficacy. Each subject-specific self-efficacy factor had as its measured variables three composite scores created by combining students' efficacy ratings on two to three problems. Grades reported for the six school subjects were used as indicators of verbal and math achievement. All structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were performed with the EQS (Bentler, 1992) program.

One of the verbal first-order factors (i.e., Spanish academic self-efficacy) did not share a meaningful proportion of its variance with other verbal factors (i.e., English and American history academic self-efficacy). This might have contributed to attenuating the observed relationship between verbal achievement and verbal academic self-efficacy. However, an additional analysis carried out with English and math (i.e., algebra and geometry) only produced essentially the same result, although the path linking English achievement to English academic self-efficacy became somewhat stronger. Another possibility is the relative complexity of achievement indexes in verbal subjects compared with those in quantitative subjects. Certain academic tasks that students are required to perform to receive grades cannot easily be represented as a single particularized problem. This is more so in verbal subjects than in math-related subjects. Math achievement showed a strong positive effect on math academic self-efficacy.",

Having only two first-order factors (e.g., internal and external verbal) as a basis for each second-order factor (e.g., verbal self-concept) presented a problem of partial underidentification of the model. To overcome this problem, a path linking verbal self-concept and external verbal was constrained to be equal to the path between math self-concept and external math. In addition, 14 error covariances were incorporated to improve the poor fit of the original model, x 2 (200, AT = 383) = 3,095.69, p < .001 (NNFI = .50, CF1 = .57). The fit of the final structural model was satisfactory, x 2 (186, # =383) = 670.53, p < .001 (NNFI = .91, CFl = .93). Improvement in fit was also significant, Ax 2 (14, N = 383) = 2,425.16, p < .001.

This makes it very hard for one to resist the temptation of reversing the direction of causality between the self and achievement factors. The fit of the model hypothesizing causal predominance of self-concept over achievement was as good as that of the classical I/E model, x 2 (186, N = 383) = 670.57, p < .001 (NNFI = .91, CFI = .93). Verbal and math self-concepts positively influenced verbal (.42) and math (.66) achievements, respectively. Verbal and math self-concepts (.31) as well as verbal and math achievements (.77) were positively correlated with each other. More important, negative relations between achievement in one area and self-concept in the other area disappeared. Instead, achievement in one area was independent of self-concept in the opposite area (-.09 between verbal self-concept and math achievement and .00 between math self-concept and verbal achievement; bothps > .05). These results are more intuitively appealing to account for the present data, especially when causal predominance of academic self-concept over achievement has been more prevalent in the literature (e.g., Marsh, 1990a) .",

Students also compare their verbal skills to their math skills and incorporate this relativistic appreciation of ability as a second basis for their academic self-concepts. Technically speaking, verbal and math academic self-concepts should display a positive correlation after the external comparison and a negative correlation after the internal comparison. Unfortunately, even when students were explicitly instructed to compare their ability in one domain with their ability in other domains (i.e., internal comparison), their verbal and math self-concepts so created failed to demonstrate a negative relationship. The relation between external comparison-based verbal and math selfconcepts was positive as the I/E model presumes but rather weak in light of the strong correlations frequently observed between verbal and math achievements.",

The strong positive correlation between verbal and math self-concepts may thus be taken as evidence that students in the present study assigned considerably more weight to the external comparison processes. However, as pointed out earlier, the direct link between the external factors was not strong enough. When the achievement factors entered the equation in the first-order path model, achievement in one area was negatively related to internal as well as external comparison-based self-concepts in the other area, indicating superior effects of internal, instead of external, comparison processes in operation. Marsh (1990c) reported strong positive correlations between verbal and math self-concepts, as did the current study. The common attribute of Marsh's study and the present investigation is that subject-specific judgments of academic capability formed the basis for more general verbal and math self-concepts. When students assess their perceived effectiveness in verbal and math domains in general, comparative superiority of achievement in one domain over the other can be accentuated. In contrast, when students assess their academic capability in a number of school subjects, multiple comparison frames may exist for each subject-specific self-concept. Consequently, the effects of internal comparison processes as illustrated by the I/E model are minimized.",

Present findings provide room for questioning the I/E model's contention that students spontaneously, if not voluntarily, undergo two separate comparison processes when reporting their self-perceived capability. At least with academic self-efficacy measures, students' judgments of their own competence appear to be constructed without the internal comparison processes. More direct tests of the I/E model can take the form of experimental design. It will be interesting to see whether students* self-concepts in verbal and math subjects are positively, negatively, or insignificantly correlated after experimentally accentuating as comparison frames their peers* ability in the same area, their own competence in different school subjects, or both. Future research should also test the hypothesis that assessing academic self-concepts in diverse school subjects versus verbal and math domains in general compromises contribution of the internal comparison processes in determining students* academic self-concepts. As Marsh (1990a) pointed out, no studies have yet pursued causal relations between self-concept and achievement factors with the distinction between verbal and math factors-as illustrated by the I/E model-accommodated. More stringent and perhaps more accurate tests of the I/E model, therefore, call for longitudinal studies of relations among verbal and math self-concepts and achievements, with temporal precedence of achievements over academic self-concepts clearly established.",
