                "text": "The academic self-concept of children who are gifted has been addressed in a variety of ways and toward a number of different ends (Dixon, 1998) , usually using the general academic/scholastic self-concept rather than the subject-specific constructs. Students who are gifted tend to have positive general academic and social self-concepts, higher than those of nongifted comparison groups (see Hoge & Renzulli, 1993; Janos & Robinson, 1985; Ross & Parker, 1980) . General academic self-concept has been positively linked to achievement for gifted students (Kelly & Jordan, 1990; Van Boxtel & Monks, 1992) and classroom peer status for adolescent girls who are gifted in a summer enrichment program (Cooley, Cornell, & Lee, 1991; Cornell et al., 1990 ). Furthermore, academic self-concept may shed light on negative academic outcomes like the underachievement of gifted children (Ross & Parker, 1980) . Fewer investigators have examined the specific math and verbal self-concepts of students who are gifted. Such work indicates that gifted students tend to have more positive feelings about their competence in math and verbal domains than nongifted students (Brounstein, Holahan, & Dreyden, 1991; Norman, Ramsay, Martray, & Roberts, 1999; Pajares & Graham, 1999) . However, the association of achievement in an academic area and related self-concept does not appear to be clear cut (Hoge & Renzulli, 1993) . For example, a student with strong mathematical and verbal achievement will not necessarily have high mathematics and verbal self-concepts. Since no models exist for explaining the relationship between gifted students' achievement and academic self-concept, further investigation of subject-specific self-concepts of students who are gifted is warranted (Williams & Montgomery, 1995) .",

This social comparison reflects the notion that peer groups provide important information about relative standing in a given domain (e.g., Festinger, 1954; Marsh, 1984; Marsh & Parker, 1984; Marsh, Smith, & Barnes, 1985; Marsh, Chessor, Craven, & Roche, 1995; Renick & Harter, 1989; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1990 ).

For example, a number of investigators have discussed the negative effect of comparison processes on the academic self-concept of students participating in gifted programs. Because intense, highly challenging coursework and close exposure to similarly talented peers are hallmarks of programs designed to serve gifted populations (Olszewski-Kubilius, 1997; Stocking, 1998) , students who are gifted frequently suffer a decrease in their perceived academic competence when first enrolled in such programs (Marsh et al., 1995; Olszewski, Kulieke, & Willis, 1987; Richardson & Benbow, 1990; Swiatek & Benbow, 1991) ; they feel less positive about their academic ability when they realize there are so many other bright young people. Furthermore, Skaalvik and Rankin (1992) evaluated the I/E model and found that this model worked well except for students who perceived Academic self-concept may shed light on negative academic outcomes like the underachievement of gifted children their math and verbal achievement to be similar, which may be the case for students who may manifest high performance in a number of academic pursuits.",

Students in the sample ranged from 12 to 16 years of age, with an average age of 14.0.

Marsh's (1986) internal/external frame of reference model was fit to students' math and verbal SAT scores and math and verbal SDQII scale scores using structural equation modeling. Since the unobserved achievement variables are each represented in the model by one observed variable, the variances of the observed achievement variables were fixed to represent appropriate reliability estimates. In general, model fit can often be improved by adding correlations between uniquenesses, or error terms, in the model. With this in mind, four models were tested: (a) the default null model, in which no relationships were posited among the observed variables; (b) model 1.0, the I/E model as proposed by Marsh (1986) with no correlated uniquenesses (i.e., error terms); (c) model 1.1, with correlated uniquenesses between the two self-concept latent variables (i.e., hypothesizing that math and verbal self-concept have common sources of unexplained variance); and (d) model 1.2, which included two additional correlated uniquenesses/error terms among the measured self-concept variables. From a practical standpoint, the three versions of the model are structurally similar in most practically important ways. Their only variation is found in the way that the models explain correlations among error terms, which is common in structural equation modeling.",

(1997) with another sample of talented young adolescents. Additional descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 . The present sample had higher means on the math and verbal self-concept than the Plucker et al. sample, which may be due to the more specific identification criteria of the present sample: Students in the present sample were identified solely by their test scores, while the Plucker et al. sample was chosen with additional criteria, such as personal essays, teacher recommendations, and grades. Table 2 contains the results of the initial model testing. The degree to which a model works to explain a given set of data is indicated by goodness-of-fit statistics. Although guidelines for interpreting fit statistics vary, several statisticians recommend that a variety of indicators be used. In this study, we used the chi square of each model divided by the degrees of freedom (with values up to 2 or possibly 3 indicating a good fit), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA, values from 0 to .5 or even .8 indicating good fit), the normed fit index (NFI, values in excess of .9 indicating good fit), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI, values of .9 or higher indicating good fit), and the Aikaike information criterion (AIC, a measure of fit used to compare models, with lower values indicating a better fit than higher values). The results presented in Table 2 provide evidence that model 1.2 is associated with the most impressive goodness-of-fit estimates, although all three models have similar estimates. Table 3 contains the parameters for each model. As has been observed in several studies, the relationship between math and verbal selfconcept scores appears to be positive and small. In contrast to previous research, however, the correlation between math and verbal achievement is also very small (i.e., not statistically different from 0). Additional descriptive analyses (i.e., investigation of histograms and descriptive statistics) were conducted to determine whether the correlation was attenuated due to low reliability, suffering from range restriction, or due to a lack of normality in each score's distribution. All three possible statistical explanations for the lack of correlation were examined and found to be without merit.",

Based on these analyses, we are not prepared to state that the relationship between achievement and self-concept for the three groups differed. This process was repeated for each of the major coefficients of interest, specifically those between the major latent variables in the I/E model. In addition, we examined the invariance of all of the major parameters collectively (the All Parameters Fixed model in Table 4 ). For all but one of these models, results did not suggest that the hypothesis of invariance could be rejected.

The major implication of the model is that educators should not expect children who are gifted to have high subject-specific self-concepts in all subjects in which they excel. To the contrary, mathematics achievement was negatively related to verbal self-concept, as was verbal achievement and math self-concept to a lesser extent. Educators need to keep in mind that in-ternal comparison processes are at work within students who are gifted, and that high achievement does not necessitate correspondingly high self-concept.

Regarding methodological issues, the possibility exists that previous research investigating the I/E model has not utilized achievement measures with sufficiently high ceilings for use with academically talented students. Given the reported SAT score distributions of similar samples of talented students identified using the Talent Search model (e.g., Ablard & Lipschultz, 1998), we suspect that the absence of a ceiling effect may be the cause of the anomaly. Students tested well out of level are not subject to a ceiling effect, and their scores appear to be normally distributed-again, both in this sample and in other samples identified using Talent Search techniques.",

This last result leads us to a discussion of the importance of instructional contexts on gifted students' self-concepts. Students who are gifted spend their academic lives in a variety of instructional (i.e., external) contexts (see Stocking, 1998) . In additional to the regular classroom, they attend after school, weekend, and summer programs, all which allow the talented adolescent to interact with a different peer group than is found in regular classroom settings. An interesting extension of the I/E model would be to cover multiple assessments of self-concept and achievement over multiple contexts, such as the regular classroom and an intensive summer program. Comparing the same model to students of average ability would also be of interest. As Marsh et al. (1995) note, the impact of a particular instructional context on gifted adolescents' academic self-concepts may be influenced by the method for selecting participants for a program, the ability of the teacher to work with academically talented students, and the level of competition, type of curriculum, and assessment strategies the students encounter within the program.",

Several researchers have also investigated the role of concurrent contexts, comparing the self-concepts of students in classes for the gifted and mixed ability classes (e.g., Chan, 1988; Kulik & Kulik, 1992; Schneider, Clegg, Byrne, Ledingham, & Crombie, 1989; Zeidner & Schleyer, 1999) . However, talented adolescents may participate in many such contexts over the course of the calendar year. Since these programs may vary considerably with respect to the variables suggested by Marsh et al. (1995), and given the support for the importance of context in the literature (i.e., the studies cited previously all suggest that \"context matters\"), the case for investigating the role of multiple instructional contexts during the development of gifted adolescents' math and verbal self-concepts is strengthened. Of course, this research will not be without problems, since much of the learning that occurs in many special programs may not be readily measured by achievement tests, and current self-concept measures may not be as sensitive to change as required for this type of research.",

While collecting this data poses certain logistical problems, they are not insurmountable. A possible model for extending this research appears in Figure 2 . Although this model appears to be complex, we believe it is a more informative model for understanding academically talented adolescents' academic self-concept development than the basic I/E model.

For example, studies of peer processes (Cooley et al., 1991; Cornell et al., 1990) suggest that positive self-concept may be important for positive peer status within a program for the gifted, which may be especially salient for talented adolescents experiencing loneliness or rejection-providing an affective justification for examination of external comparison processes across instructional contexts. Other affective variables, such as intrinsic motivation, may also provide additional insight into talented students' development.
