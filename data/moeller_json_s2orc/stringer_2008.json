The Block Design and Vocabulary subtests of the WISC-ILI were administered to all partic ipants. These two subtests were selected because they have excellent reli ability and validity, and correlate highly with the Full Scale score over a wide age range (Sattler, 1992) . For the Vocabulary and Block Design combination, the reliability estimates calculated with the Tellegen and Briggs (1967) procedure are r = 0.91 and r = 0.86 (Sattler, 1992) . The scaled scores were determined for each of the subtests and then added together to determine the total scaled score. The scaled score was converted to the WISC score using a conversion table that estimates the Full Scale IQ based on the sum of the two subtest scaled scores (Sattler, 1992) .",

Future research should work toward complex aspects of these relationships.",

The ceiling effect that results from the modal score of 4.0 (the highest possible) damps down variability. It does not elim inate it, however, and 50 per cent of the participants had scores below 4.0. Students who score high on self-perceived competence at time 1 should be among those who improve in performance over time, and vice versa, if self-perceived competence has a causal role. The lack of change in self-perception over time speaks against this causal role because there was significant change in performance. If self-perceived competence were either the cause or the result of changes in performance, it should track change in performance. The lack of change in self-perception despite change in performance strongly implies independence between the two factors.",

Likewise, a different participant age-group might have shown different results. Perhaps adolescents would be more likely to show the effect of interest. Future research might productively look into other domains, with different instruments having similar domain-specificity, different participant populations and longer dura tions.

This is in the procedure of partialling out variance in time 1 achievement from time 2 achievement scores. Instead, we correlated our self-perception measures directly with the difference in achievement scores between time 1 and time 2. We believe that this test of the hypothesis is more direct than one can infer causality if one can explain change in scores over time, not merely end states. The practice of statistically removing variance attributable to time 1 achievement is not conceptually the same. This process will control for the influence of prior learning on later learning. However, this is a rather artificial conceptlater learning depends completely upon earlier learning having taken place. The use of a change score does not eliminate the influence of prior learning, and does directly represent what must be explained -the changes in achievement which may, or may not, be due to self perception.",

Using this process, we would appear to explain, then, about 9 per cent of the variance in achievement. However, the process we used, correlating change in achievement scores over the year with domain-matched self-perception, yielded correlations of essentially zero. This procedure would indicate that self-perception accounts for no variance in the growth or decline in achievement, an effect size of zero. Thus this study replicates the findings of the Valentine et al. (2004) meta-analysis on one level, but also gives new food for thought in the ongoing debate about self-concept and achievement.",
