Student self-concept ratings were internally consistent, reasonably stable over time, and measured distinct components of self-concept consistent with the design of the instrument used to collect the ratings. Student self-concepts in each of the different areas were significantly correlated with teacher ratings of their self-concepts in the same area, and student-teacher agreement was specific to particular dimensions (as demonstrated by a multitrait-multimethod analysis). Academic ability measures were uncorrelated with self-concept in four nonacademic areas and most highly correlated with the particular area of academic self-concept most logically related to the particular ability measure (e.g., reading achievement and reading self-concept). Thus, multiple dimensions of self-concept showed a logical and consistent pattern of relationships with a variety of criteria. Changes in self-concept over the 6-month period were also reasonably reliable, multidimensional, and specific to each area of self-concept, but they were not correlated with changes in the criterion variables.",

The study of self-concept represents one of the oldest areas of research in the social sciences. (The longest chapter in William James' textbook, the first introductory textbook in psychology, was about self-concept.) There are also interesting peculiarities about research in this area. Unlike other areas of research, the study of self-concept has not occurred within a particular discipline. Also, although many thousands of studies have been published in this area (Wylie, 1979) , only a few researchers have published a significant number of studies or have continued their research over an extended period of time. In fact, much of the research in this area emphasizes other Requests for reprints should be sent to Herbert W. Marsh, Department of Education, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia. theoretical constructs, and the interest in self-concept comes from its assumed relevance to these other constructs. It also appears that many of these studies lack either a theoretical basis for the study of self-concept or methodological/measurement sophistication. Reviews of self-concept research (e.g., Burns, 1979; Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976; Wells & Marwell, 1976; Wylie, 1974,197ft) typically emphasize the lack of theoretical basis in most studies, the poor quality of measurement instruments used to assess self-concept, methodological shortcomings, and a general lack of consistent findings (other than support for the null hypothesis). The disappointing lack of rigor can perhaps be explained by the lack of identification of self-concept research with any particular discipline or researchers.",

It is formed through experience with the environment, interactions with significant others, and attributions of one's own behavior. The organization of self-concept is multifaceted and hierarchical, with perceptions moving from inferences about self in subareas (e.g., self-concepts in academic areas), to broader areas (e.g., academic and nonacademic self-concept), and finally to general self-concept. Shavelson hypothesizes that this organization becomes increasingly multifaceted as an individual approaches adulthood and will depend on the particular category system developed by an individual and shared by a group. He proposes that self-concept is both descriptive and evaluative (i.e., he does not distinguish between self-concept and self-esteem). This theoretical model of self-concept is the one favored by the present authors, and it provided the basis for the design of the Self Description Questionnaire (SDQ) used in this study.",

                "text": "Self-concept is a hypothetical construct whose usefulness must be demonstrated by investigations of its construct validity. These investigations can be classified as within-network or between-network studies. Within-network studies explore the multidimensionality of self-concept and attempt to show that it has consistent, distinct components (e.g., physical, social, and academic). These studies typically employ factor analysis or multitrait-multimethod analysis. Between-network studies attempt to demonstrate a theoretically consistent (or at least logical) pattern of relationships between measures of self-concept and other constructs. These studies relate self-concept indices to other variables such as measures of ability/performance; self-concept ratings inferred by significant others (e.g., teachers, parents, peers); family background variables; (e.g., SES); behavioral observations; experimental manipulations; and other self-report measures (e.g., anxiety, locus of control). Shavelson's model of self-concept and his assumption that self-concept is multifaceted and hierarchically ordered provides an explicit hypothesis about its structure. His assumption of multidimensionality is im-plicit in most self-concept research-particularly the within-network studies. Nevertheless, factor analyses of responses to the most commonly used self-concept instruments typically fail to identify a consistent and theoretically defensible factor structure (see Marsh & Smith, 1982; Shavelson et al., 1976; Wylie, 1974 Wylie, ,1979 . The best empirical support for the multidimensionality of selfconcept, and particularly for the structure hypothesized by Shavelson, comes from work with the SDQ. The SDQ was specifically designed to measure three areas of academic self-concept and four areas of nonacademic self-concept derived from the Shavelson model. Factor analyses of responses from quite different populations of children have consistently identified the seven SDQ factors, and correlations among these factors supported the hierarchical arrangement hypothesized by Shavelson (Marsh, Relich, & Smith, in press; Marsh, Smith, & Barnes, in press) . Multitraitmultimethod studies (Marsh, Parker, & Smith, 1983 ) also demonstrate the distinctiveness of these self-concept factors.",

For them, the relationship between self-reports and ratings by others is of critical importance to their theoretical perspective. For other researchers, ratings by others are used to determine how accurately self-concept can be inferred by an external observer, and these ratings provide a convenient measure to supplement or validate self-concept instruments. Shrauger and Schoeneman (1979) reviewed studies that correlated self-reports with judgments by others and concluded that \"there is no consistent agreement between people's self-perceptions and how they are viewed by others.\" They reported that half the studies in their review found no significant correlation, whereas a majority of the remaining studies found low correlations or contained ambiguous results. Marsh (Marsh, Parker, & Smith, 1983) argued that ratings by others are phenomenologically distinct and will only agree with self-reports if the external observer knows the subject well, observes a wide range of behaviors, has viewed a wide enough range of subjects to have established a frame of reference, is able to make skillful perceptions and discriminations, and is judging the same characteristics as is the subject. Marsh went on to demonstrate that student selfconcepts as inferred by primary school teachers (who satisfy his criteria better than most external observers) on each of the seven SDQ dimensions were significantly correlated with student ratings of their own selfconcepts in the same areas. Studentteacher agreement tended to be higher in academic areas, particularly in high-socio-economic-status (SES)/ability schools where several correlations exceeded .7. Thus, at least in some circumstances, external observers are able to infer self-concept with a reasonable degree of accuracy.",

For example, Shavelson and Bolus (1982) found that grades in English, mathematics and science were more highly correlated with each of the corresponding self-concepts in these academic areas than with general self-concept. Bachman (1970) reported that IQ correlated .46 with academic self-concept but only .14 with general self-esteem. Marsh, Relich, and Smith (in press) demonstrated that mathematical achievement was substantially correlated with mathematics self-concept (r = .55), less correlated with self-concepts in other academic areas (reading, .21; and all school subjects, .43), and uncorrelated with selfconcepts in four nonacademic areas. In a recent meta-analysis of research in this area Hansford and Hattie (1982) found ability/ performance correlated about .2 with general self-concept and about .4 with self-concept of ability. Marsh (Note 1) further argued that even higher correlations can be found when a child's frame of reference is considered. According to his model, children in high-SES/ability schools and low-SES/ ability schools use their relative standing among other children within their own school as the basis of their academic selfconcept. Thus a child's academic self-concept will not only depend on the child's academic ability but on how this ability compares with those in his or her school. Consistent with his model, he found that academic self-concept was positively correlated with academic ability, that academic selfconcept was negatively correlated with school-average measures of academic ability and SES, and that nonacademic self-concept was uncorrelated with either individual or school-average measures of these variables. In summary, academic-ability/performance is relatively uncorrelated with self-concept in nonacademic areas, substantially correlated with academic self-concept, and modestly correlated with measures that do not distinguish between academic and nonacademic self-concept.",

The items actually administered vary according to grade level. Approximately two-thirds of the items for fifth-and sixth-grade students are identical, but the additional one-third administered to 5th graders are somewhat easier, and those administered to 6th graders are somewhat more difficult. Although there was statistically significant improvement over the interval separating the two testings, scores for both testings were far below the national average. Coefficient alphas (Hull & Nie, 1981) were computed for both testings in Grade 5 (.82 and .85) and in Grade 6 (.83 and .85). The testretest correlation for the test was .70, and the im-provement in performance over this interval (a difference of 1.6 points) was statistically significant, \u00a3(516) = 6.98, p < .01. Using these values and the equation for determining the reliability of a difference score presented by Thorndike and Hagen (1977) , the reliability of these differences scores was estimated to be .47. For purposes of this study, the PAT scores were standardized separately for the 5th-and 6th-grade students so that after standardization, each grade level had total scores with a mean of .0 and a standard deviation of 1.0. The standardization was conducted across responses from Time 1 and Time 2, so that differences in performance over the time interval were not lost.",

In previous research Marsh (Marsh, Parker, & Smith, 1983 ; and results from Time 1 of Study 1 of this investigation; Marsh, Smith, & Barnes, in press) demonstrated that standardizing teachers' ratings within each class to have the same mean and standard deviation increased student-teacher agreement and reduced the size of correlations among teachers' ratings in different areas of self-concept. This effect was observed at Time 1 and Time 2 of Study 1, but not in Study 2, where standardizing teacher ratings within classes actually reduced the size of studentteacher agreement. This suggests that teachers in Study 2 were using a similar frame of reference in forming judgments of student self-concept and that differences in responses made by different teachers may reflect real differences in student self-concepts rather than response biases in the way teachers use a response scale. Given the results of Study 2, it seemed unwarranted to standardize teacher ratings, and this was not done in Study 1, in order to maintain comparability in the analysis of the two studies. It should be noted that for changes in teachers' ratings, any response bias that is consistent from Time 1 to Time 2 will be cancelled out when the difference in these two scores is taken. Parker, and Smith (1983) .

Correlations between the GAP and teacher ratings of reading ability were .67 and .68 for each of the two testings. Difference scores (Time 2 -Time 1) were computed separately for both forms of the GAP, and these correlated .32 with each other, resulting in a reliability estimate of .45 for the total difference score based upon both forms of the test.",

Student self-concepts in each of the seven areas and each of the total scores were determined by taking an unweighted average of responses to items in each scale after items had been standardized to have a mean of .0 and a standard deviation of 1.0. This standardization was conducted across responses from Time 1 to Time 2, so that changes in self-concept over the time interval were not lost. A value of .0 (i.e., the mean after standardization) was substituted for any missing values, though less than .5% of the responses were left blank. Responses to the items representing each scale were then used to determine a coefficient alpha estimate of the reliability of each scale at Time 1 and Time 2. Coefficient alpha reliability estimates were computed for responses to each of the reading achievement tests and to teacher responses to the self-concept total scores (where responses to the specific areas were averaged together). Correlations among the 10 student self-concept scores and all the criterion variables were determined using \"pair-wise deletion of variables\" due to missing values (see Hull & Me, 1981) .",

He suggested that the term convergence coefficient rather than convergent validity coefficient be used for MTMM studies involving this type of method variation. In contrast, convergence between student self-ratings of self-concept and self-concept inferred by their teachers provides a strong test of the construct validity of self-concept. As a consequence of this distinction, stability and validity (i.e., student-teacher agreement) are discussed separately below.",

Recently, a variety of confirmatory factor analysis procedures have been used to analyze MTMM matrices (see Marsh & Hocevar, in press , for a review). This approach could have been applied in the present investigation as well, but several complications in this particular application argued against its use. In addition to the lack of availability of the computer software and the prohibitive coat such an analysis would entail, this investigation really involves two different types of \"method\" variation-the rater (student or teacher) and time. Although confirmatory factor analysis has occasionally been applied when the method variation was time (e.g., Shavelson & Bolus, 1982) , the authors know of no application of it to the analysis of a multitraitmultimethod-multitime matrix. The extension of confirmatory factor analysis of MTMM matrices to include a time dimension would be an important contribution to MTMM analysis, but this theoretical development is beyond the scope of the present investigation. Teacher ratings: Note. Correlations are presented without decimal points in this and subsequent tables. Correlations of r = .10 in Study 1 and r = .16 are statistically significant (p < .05, two-tailed). Coefficients in parentheses are internal consistency estimates (for student ratings only), and underlined correlations are convergence coefficients. Each variable is represented by two letters (the area of self-concept and the source of the rating), and a number (time of rating), as described in the text.

The higher consistencies of the total scores are due to a larger number of items, even though the average interitem correlation is lower. There is a similar pattern of results in both studies and at each time; the lowest internal consistencies occur for Physical Abilities and Relations with Parents, and academic selfconcepts are more internally consistent than nonacademic self-concepts (except, perhaps, for Physical Appearance). The stability over time is also high for both individual scales (mean r = .61) and the total scores (mean r = .65). There is no ap-parent explanation for the particularly low stability coefficient for Relations with Parents in Study 2, though the stability of this factor was also among the lowest in Study 1. Although these coefficients are high, they are not nearly so high as the internal consistency coefficients. This suggests that there was systematic change in the student self-concepts during the time interval.",

This situation certainly exists here, as both the SDQ and the Shavelson model upon which it is based assume a hierarchical ordering of self-concepts. In particular, it is assumed that self-concepts cluster into academic and nonacademic areas. Earlier discussion provides support for this assumption. A more detailed examination of the coefficients, however, does provide some problems to this general conclusion. For both student and teacher ratings, Relationships with Parents is only moderately correlated with the other nonacademic factors, and some correlations between it and the academic factors (particularly those involving All School Subjects) are substantial. For student ratings, though perhaps not teacher ratings, the small correlation among student self-concepts in Reading and Mathematics is surprising.

It was argued earlier that the substantial differences between the reliability at each time and the stability over time is an indication of systematic change; there is a lack of agreement between the two measures beyond that which can be explained by the unreliability of the measures.

Even though changes in student self-concepts do appear to be reliable, changes in the criterion measures may not be. Although internal consistency estimates could not be computed for changes in 3 Numerous researchers describe why it is undesirable to compute simple difference scores (e.g., Cronbach & Furby, 1970) , though there is no agreement as to what the best alternative is. For Study 1 residualized (partialed or regression-adjusted) change scores were calculated for the 10 student self-concept scales and each of the criterion variables. However, even with these residualized difference scores, there was little or no correlation between changes in student self-concepts and changes in the criterion variables. To simplify the discussion of the analysis and the findings, only the simple difference scores are reported. It should be noted that limiting the analysis to simple difference scores would probably reduce the reliability of the change scores and render their multidimensionality less clear. Thus, the conclusions that changes in students' self-concepts are reasonably reliable and clearly multidimensional are unlikely to be altered (except, perhaps, strengthened) if alternative analytic procedures were applied. teacher ratings in specific areas, reliability estimates for changes in their total scores are reasonably high (rs between .70 and .78 in the two studies). Reliability estimates for differences in reading achievement (.46 and .45 in the two studies) were lower, but they still suggest that there is reliable variance in these difference scores. These results suggest that there are reliable changes in self-concepts and at least some reliable differences in the criterion variables as well. However, these two sets of difference scores are relatively uncorrelated with each other. Unlike findings described in other portions of this study, this conclusion does not support the construct validity of self-concept, although, because of the problems inherent in the use of difference scores, this conclusion is somewhat tentative. Furthermore, the findings do not imply that changes that take place over a longer time interval would also be uncorrelated. Difference scores representing a longer time interval will be more reliable and may also reflect different characteristics than those in the present investigation. Nevertheless, if this conclusion is supported in further research, the implications are discouraging for researchers who want to relate changes in self-concept to other variables (including the effects of experimental programs designed to improve self-concepts).",

Thus, it is unlikely that even a dramatic change in some particular aspect of a person's life will have a large effect on self-concept. Theoretically, and from the perspective of measurement theory, it is desirable that self-concept be relatively stable over time. Some researchers also argue that it is important to a person's mental health that self-concept be relatively stable. Nevertheless, much of the interest in self-concept is directed toward changes in self-concept. The improvement in self-concept is a frequent \"goal\" of intervention programs, and it is often hypothesized that changes in self-concept may lead to the improvement in other desirable outcomes (e.g., academic ability). Obviously, self-concept cannot be perfectly stable and still be responsive to dramatic life events or systematic interventions. Herein lies the dilemma.",

This seems to satisfy several theoretical and methodological concerns. Second, it was also found that changes in self-concept were systematic and reliable as well. This offers hope to researchers wanting to relate changes in selfconcept to other variables. Third, it was found that there is a clear, logical, and predictable (based upon Shavelson's model and the design of the SDQ) ordering of self-concept factors. Particular factors of self-concept were most strongly correlated with variables to which they are theoretically related, and uncorrelated with variables to which they are theoretically unrelated. Thus, it is at least possible for a particularly dramatic change in a person's life or an experimental intervention to have a substantial effect on some particular component of self-concept, even if it has a less substantial effect on overall self-concept. The suggestion that changes in self-concept over time are also multidimensional and are specific to particular dimensions of self-concept also adds support to this conclusion. Consequently, it seems that the empirical findings may offer an acceptable compromise for both sides of the dilemma; self-concept is relatively stable, but the changes that do take place are reliable and specific to particular dimensions of self-concept. In contrast to this optimistic picture is the finding that these changes in self-concept do not appear to be related to changes in other variables that are logically related to self-concept. Methodological issues and the need for additional research dictate caution in interpreting this last finding, but these results are consistent with the general lack of success of interventions that attempt to change selfconcept (e.g., Scheirer & Kraut, 1979) .",

Several lines of reasoning argue that the correspondence should be better for longer time intervals. First, difference scores have the paradoxical property of becoming more reliable as the correlation between the two scores (the test-retest correlation in this application) becomes lower. Since the test-retest correlations both of the self-concept scores and of the criterion measures are almost certain to drop if the interval between them is longer, then the reliabilities of the difference scores are almost certain to be higher. Second, there is the question of the validity of the difference scores. Since reliability sets an upper bound for validity, it is likely that difference scores based upon a longer time interval will be more valid as well. The validity of difference scores must be assessed against changes in the underlying construct being measured. It is unlikely that there will be large systematic changes in either selfconcept or academic abilities within the space of 6 months, and thus there is relatively little reliable variance that the difference scores could explain. It seems reasonable that larger and more systematic changes are likely to take place over a longer period of time, and perhaps these larger changes will be accurately reflected by the difference scores. There is support for these arguments in research by Brookover (Brookover, Erikson, & Joiner, 1976 ; also see Calsyn & Kenny, 1977) , who collected selfconcept data and academic achievement scores over a 3-year interval and found that changes in academic self-concept were significantly correlated with changes in academic achievement.",

Nevertheless, higher order factor analyses also indicate that there is a hierarchical arrangement of the factors.
