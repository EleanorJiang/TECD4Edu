In response to the need to attain academic excellence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between academic self-concept and learning strategies, and their predictions with respect to academic achievement. There is ample international research evidence that students' academic achievement is positively affected by their high selfconcept and effective learning strategies. These positive factors are important variables that enhance effective learning, facilitating the realization of full human potential (Pintrich, Marx, & Boyle, 1993) .",

It is one of the most important psychological constructs in the behavioral sciences . According to Willims (2003) , selfconcept serves as an important factor that influences economic success, and long-term health and well-being. The desire to feel positively about oneself and the benefits of this feeling on choice, planning, persistence, and subsequent accomplishments are also well documented through research (Marsh, Craven, & McInerney, 2003 McInerney, Marsh, & Craven, 2008) . Although research evidence suggests the importance of a positive self-concept to achievement, many educational policy statements also emphasize self-concept enhancement as a central goal of education, and emphasize self-concept as an important mediating factor that facilitates the attainment of other desirable learning, psychological, and behavioral outcomes (Craven, Marsh, & Burnett, 2003; Marsh, Koller, & Baumert, 2001) .",

In this model, global self-concept is at the apex of the hierarchy and it is divided into academic and nonacademic components. The academic component is divided into self-concepts specific to school subjects, including English and Mathematics, whereas the nonacademic component is divided into physical, social, and emotional components. It is suggested that specific components of self-concept should have more predictive power on outcomes in specific domains than a single, global component of self-concept. Research in education indicates that academic achievement is more correlated with academic self-concept than global self-concept, and that achievement in specific domains should be correlated with the corresponding specific domains of selfconcept Seaton, Marsh, & Craven, 2010) . Following this line of thought, in this study, particular attention has been given to how students perceive their abilities in English and Mathematics, and how the two variables predicted achievement in English and Mathematics, respectively. English and Mathematics were chosen as the target subjects for two reasons. First, these two subjects were usually the focus of investigation in previous studies, and the English/Mathematics self-concept scales have been well established with good reliability and validity (Byrne, 1988; Marsh, 1992; Marsh & O'Neill, 1984) . Second, English and Mathematics are major subjects in Hong Kong and mastery of these two subjects usually requires the use of different learning strategies. Although self-concept is found to predict positive achievement outcomes, recent research has shown the reciprocal relationship between academic self-concept and academic achievement (Guay, Marsh, & Boivin, 2003; .",

Social frames of reference indicate to us what our capacities and qualities are under particular circumstances. For example, on an objective criterion, some individuals may be quite good at Mathematics, yet when they use others who are superior at Mathematics as a frame of reference they may develop a relatively negative Mathematics self-concept (e.g., see Marsh & Craven, 1997; Marsh, Walker, & Debus, 1991) . This is sometimes referred to as an external frame of reference. Furthermore, according to Marsh, we tend to compare our self-perceived skills in one area (such as Mathematics) with our selfperceived skills in another (such as English) and use this internal, relativistic impression as a second basis for arriving at our self-concept in particular areas (Dickh\u00e4user, Reuter, & Hilling, 2005; Marsh & Hau, 2004; Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002) . This is sometimes referred to as an internal frame of reference. Hence, individuals who are good at Mathematics and English may, nevertheless, have a more negative selfconcept in Mathematics if they perceive that they are better at English and vice versa. Marsh (Marsh & Craven, 1997; see also M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & Koller, 2006; Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002) has called the combined effect the internal-external frame-of-reference effect. This effect seems to be universal among students from a wide range of cultures (Marsh & Hau, 2004) . For purposes of this study, we will examine the internal/external frame-of-reference effect.",

Research has shown that the learning strategies a student adopts for learning an academic task influence the quality of learning outcomes achieved (Covington, 2000; Watkins, McInerney, Akande, & Lee, 2003; Watkins, McInerney, Lee, Akande, & Regmi, 2002) . Learning strategies describe the ways in which students engage in the learning tasks. Using Biggs's (1987) framework, there are two types of strategies that students may adopt: deep and surface (Kember, Biggs, & Leung, 2004; Kember & Watkins, 2010) . Students who adopt deep strategies engage actively in learning the study materials. They try to understand the key concepts and the underlying meaning of the materials, and relate new learning with previous relevant knowledge and personal experiences. They are interested in the tasks and would like to achieve thorough mastery of the knowledge. Alternatively, students who adopt surface strategies pay attention to bare essentials through rote learning, without devoting effort to reach understanding. They do not attempt to organize the learning materials or relate them to personal experiences. Their goal of studying is simply to fulfill situational demands such as getting the assignments done and the courses passed. In general, deep learning strategies enable students to organize new information, relate ideas, and monitor their understanding of learning materials and, therefore, perform better on academic tasks. For students who only aim to pass, surface strategies may allow them to survive in the tests and examinations with minimal effort, but low-quality learning may result with subsequent detriments to future academic achievement.",

Given the importance to excel in academic achievement in Hong Kong, investigation on the means to achieve academically is very important. In the Hong Kong school context, therefore, the relationships between academic selfconcept and learning strategies need to be explored, and their direct and indirect effects on students' achievement also need to be clarified. From one perspective, students who have higher self-concept are more likely to engage in academic tasks, regulate their learning, and engage in effective learning strategies to enhance academic achievement. From another perspective, students who are deep learners are more likely to have enhanced self-concepts thereby enhancing academic achievement. To this end, the present study aims to examine the relative effects of academic selfconcept and learning strategies as well as the direction of effect in predicting academic achievement of Hong Kong secondary school students. Understanding their direction of effect on achievement is important theoretically and practically. From the theoretical perspective, it enriches our literature on the conceptual relationships among the variables that predict achievement; and from the practical perspective, it provides important insights for educators on the instructional approaches to enhance student achievement.",

Deep learning strategies represent comprehensive understanding of learning materials through organization of new information, extensive reading, discussion, reflection, and application. They were measured with five items. Sample items include \"When I study, I always think of related things to help my understanding\" and \"I always think of how to apply my knowledge into my daily life.\" Surface learning strategies refer to rote learning or memorization without in-depth involvement with the task. They were measured with five items. Sample items include \"I find that the best way to learn many subjects is to memorize them by heart\" and \"I think it is better to focus on learning facts and details about a topic rather than try to understand all about it.\" All the items were scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). A higher score indicated a higher endorsement of the learning strategies.

The direction of effect was investigated by comparing two competing models (Models A and B) delineating the possible relationships between academic self-concept and learning strategies. The analysis of these proposed models followed a two-step procedure. First, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate factor structures to confirm the construct validity of the scales. Second, the factor analysis model was generalized to structural equation models (SEMs) by incorporating a linear structural equation to assess the effects of independent (exogenous) latent variables to dependent (endogenous) latent variables (Bentler, 1983; Bollen, 1989 ; S. Lee, 2007) . The factor structures of the academic self-concept and learning strategies scales and the hypothesized relationships between students' academic achievement, academic self-concept, and learning strategies were examined using Mplus 6.12 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998 -2011 based on full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation. Conventional indices were used to evaluate model fit: \u03c7 2 goodness-of-fit test, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). Furthermore, Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were used to help compare models (Loehlin, 2004) . Small values on AIC and BIC suggest better models in terms of model fit and parsimony. In addition, AIC difference (\u0394AIC or \u0394 i ), a measure of a less plausible fitted model relative to the best model, was calculated to examine whether the models were essentially equivalent with each other. Simply put, \u0394 i equals to AIC i minus AIC best model , where AIC i is the AIC value of model i and AIC best model is the AIC value of the best model. As a rule of thumb, \u0394 i lying between 0 and 2 suggests substantial evidence to support the equivalency of the models, values between 3 and 7 indicate that the less plausible fitted model has considerably less support, and values higher than 10 indicate that this model is very unlikely (Burnham & Anderson, 2002) .",

These results provide support for the internal/external frame-of-reference effect (see Marsh & Hau, 2004) . Mathematics self-concepts (for Mathematics achievement). This finding suggests that enhancing students' use of deep learning strategies may increase their selfconcepts leading to improved academic performance. Of course the adequate data fit of Models A and B suggests that the effects are reciprocal. Results of Model A demonstrated that having high English or Mathematics self-concepts was associated with students having increased use of deep learning strategies. Second, it is also clear from the results of Model B that students who utilized surface learning strategies had reduced English and Mathematics achievement and this effect was partially mediated by self-concept. Although the mediated effects were weaker than the direct effects, results suggest that emphasizing surface learning will predict diminished self-concepts and diminished academic achievement.",

First, students should be encouraged to adopt deep learning strategies. In everyday classroom teaching, teachers can incorporate meaningful organizers such as flowcharts, diagrams, or tables to help students relate information, and to provide authentic examples for students to apply learning materials to daily life. Instead of teaching students surface tactics such as rote learning, teachers can introduce to students some meaningful metacognitive skills, including note taking and self-questioning, to achieve a thorough understanding of materials. Assessments given to students should also involve a high level of information processing. For example, students should be asked to write critiques that require analysis and reflection, rather than simply recall factual information. All these suggestions for facilitating deep learning are just speculative, and future research is needed to verify their effectiveness.",

This is evidenced by the support for the domain specificity of self-concept in this study in which the correlation between self-concept and academic achievement is higher for related subjects than nonrelated ones. As suggested by Marsh and Craven (2006) , it is more effective for teachers to encourage students' positive self-concept as part of their normal classroom practices than implement separate self-concept interventions that are isolated from the setting where learning occurs. Craven et al. (2003) propose some proactive strategies for teachers to enhance students' self-concept. They include delivery of constructive feedback and judicious praise, provision of support to encourage students to make appropriate attributions for success and failure, and reinforcement for positive self-talk. Despite the reciprocal relationship between self-concept and academic achievement, it is equally important for teachers to work on skill development apart from self-enhancement, such that students' ability or achievement can be raised. It is believed that teachers should try to improve simultaneously academic selfconcept and academic achievement of their students so as to produce positive changes in both constructs (Guay et al., 2003) .",
