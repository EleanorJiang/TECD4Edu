In an attempt to remedy this situation, Shavelson et al. (1976) reviewed existing research and self-concept instruments and provided a theoretical definition and model of self-concept that has had a profound influence on subsequent research (see review by Marsh & Hattie, 1996) . In the Shavelson et al. model, self-concept is posited to be a multidimensional, hierarchical construct. Global self-concept, at the apex of the hierarchy, is divided into nonacademic (e.g., social, physical, emotional) and academic components. Of particular relevance to the present investigation, academic self-concept is divided into self-concepts in particular content areas such as math and verbal self-concepts. Support for the construct validity of self-concept interpretations and its multidimensionality requires that (a) academic outcomes are more highly correlated with academic self-concept than with global and nonacademic components of self-concept, and (b) achievement in particular domains is more highly correlated with academic selfconcepts in the matching domain (e.g., math achievement and math self-concept) than self-concepts in nonmatching domains (e.g., math achievement and general or verbal self-concept).",

For example, Suls (1993) noted the extreme divergence of claims in related issues in chapters written by Marsh (1993) and Brown (1993) that appeared in his monograph, concluding, \"both Brown and Marsh, who cite strong support for their viewpoints, cannot be right; or, at minimum, a new integrative theory is needed to reconcile the two approaches\" (p. x).

Thus, for example, to the extent that individuals have different frames of reference, the same objective indicators of academic achievement will lead to different academic selfconcepts. In the typical application of social comparison theory (e.g., Diener & Fujita, 1997; Marsh, 1993; Morse & Gergen, 1970; Suls, 1977) , it is assumed that individuals evaluate their own performance in comparison with the performances of others through social comparison processes. Particularly in educational settings, there is good support for how social comparison processes associated with well-established group membership (the school one attends) affects self-concept. Diener and Fujita (1997) referred to this as situationally imposed or forced comparisons as opposed to a more flexible situation in which individuals have considerable freedom to consciously select or construct a comparison target so as to maximize various goals. Diener and Fujita emphasized that schools closely approximate a \"total environment\" (where the frame of reference affecting judgment is limited to the immediate context) implicit in the forced comparison. The school is a total environment in that there are so many inherent constraints and a natural emphasis on social comparison of achievement levels of classmates in a school setting. Similarly, educational psychologists (e.g., Covington, 1992; Marsh, 1993; Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2000; Marshall & Weinstein, 1984 ; also see Goethals & Darley, 1987) emphasized the extreme salience of achievement as a reference point within a school setting, particularly when the outcome measure is academic self-concept. Diener and Fujita noted that Marsh's research studies (e.g., Marsh, 1993; Marsh & Craven, 1997; Marsh & Parker, 1984) are one of the best validated examples in support of social comparison theory, demonstrating that imposed comparisons do have a substantial, lasting impact. As emphasized by Diener and Fujita, Marsh's research clearly supports this traditional application of social comparison theory. However, Marsh (1986) found that this classic approach to social comparison theory was not able to explain the seemingly paradoxical pattern of relations he found between math and verbal selfconcept measures and corresponding measures of math and verbal achievement, the focus of the present investigation. To explain these results, he developed the I/E model that is an extension of social comparison theory.",

Early research, however, demonstrated that math and verbal self-concepts were much more differentiated than the corresponding achievement scores (Marsh, 1986) . In contrast to the expectation of high correlations between math and verbal self-concepts, math and verbal self-concepts were nearly uncorrelated. Furthermore, this near-zero correlation was consistent across different measures of the math and verbal selfconcepts and a diversity of settings (Marsh, 1986; Marsh & Craven, 1997; .

Both of these processes, however, affect self-concept responses. Hence, the joint operation of these processes, depending on the relative weight given to internal and external comparisons, is consistent with the near-zero correlation between math and verbal self-concepts that led to the development of the I/E model.

However, stronger tests of the I/E model are possible when math and verbal achievements are related to math and verbal self-concepts (see Figure 1A ). The external comparison process predicts that good math skills lead to higher math self-concepts and that good verbal skills lead to higher verbal self-concepts. According to the internal comparison process, however, good math skills should lead to lower verbal self-concepts (once the positive effects of good verbal skills are controlled), that is, \"The better I am at mathematics, the poorer I am at verbal subjects (relative to my good math skills).\" Similarly, better verbal skills should lead to lower math self-concept (once the positive effects of good math skills are controlled). In models used to test this prediction ( Figure  1A ), the horizontal paths leading from math achievement to math self-concept and from verbal achievement to verbal self-concept (the gray horizontal lines in Figure 1A ) are predicted to be substantially positive (indicated by \u03e9\u03e9 in Figure 1A ). However, the cross paths leading from math achievement to verbal self-concept and from verbal achievement to math self-concept (the dark lines in Figure 1A ) are predicted to be negative. Although consistent with the I/E model, it is these negative cross paths-the negative effects of verbal achievement on math self-concept and of math achievement on verbal self-concept-that initially appeared to be paradoxical and that provide the critical test of the I/E model. It is also important to clarify what is actually being tested in the I/E model. Typically, math and verbal achievements are substantially positively correlated with each other (the typical \"big-G\" that underlies almost all measures of achievement) and typically each is positively correlated with both math and verbal self-concepts. Math achievement is more correlated with math self-concept than verbal self-concept (and verbal achievement is more correlated with verbal self-concept than math self-concept). The critical prediction for the I/E model, however, is in terms of the path coefficients. In other words, it is the effect of math achievement on verbal self-concept after controlling for the effect of verbal achievement. Hence, once we control for the positive effect of verbal achievement (and the big-G component shared by math and verbal achievement) on verbal self-concept, then the unique component of math achievement is negatively associated with verbal self-concept. Thus, the size of the negative effect of math achievement on verbal self-concept should be a function of the discrepancy between the math and verbal achievement scores. Hence, the operative construct is a residual score that is conceptually like the difference score (without some of the statistical problems associated with raw difference scores). Thus, a B average in mathematics may induce an average or even below-average mathematics selfconcept for the student who earns As in most other school subjects, but may lead to an above-average math self-concept for the student who earns Cs in other subjects. In the language of path analysis, it is the direct effect of math achievement on verbal self-concept that Figure 1 .

Across these different studies, support for the I/E predictions have been shown to generalize well across different sets of items used to infer self-concept and a variety of different indicators of achievement (e.g., test scores, school grades, teacher ratings).",

The authors concluded that \"as shown experimentally for the first time, dimensional comparison information can have inverse effects on task-related cognitions in other domains\" (p. 833). Importantly, they demonstrated simultaneous support for both the internal comparison process (based on experimentally manipulated feedback about the relative performance in two different tasks) and the external comparison process (based on experimentally manipulated feedback about performance relative to other students). This research is important, using a true experimental design with random assignment to groups to support the causality in the causal path models that are the basis of the I/E model. Whereas a growing number of studies have found support for the I/E model in different countries and cultural groups, each was based on results from a single country and a methodology (e.g., achievement indicators, instrumentation, translation, selection and representativeness of the sample, and statistical analysis) that is largely idiosyncratic to the particular study. In their critique of research in this area, Marsh and Yeung (2001) noted the need to pursue cross-national and cross-cultural comparisons systematically in order to evaluate more fully the generalizability of support based on the I/E model. The present investigation in which the same materials (with appropriate translation) were used in representative samples from different countries is clearly stronger in terms of cross-cultural comparisons than any previous research.",

This is an inevitable consequence of the symbolic construction of self-image by using the meaning system that is culture (Kashima, 1995) . Indeed, Singelis (2000) argued that this emphasis on self has been the primary basis for other disciplines increasingly embracing cross-cultural perspectives. However, there exists a schism between the overarching cultural relativist and universalist perspectives of cross-cultural research (Kagitcibasi & Poortinga, 2000) . The broad cultural relativist (idiographic, emic, indigenous, qualitative) perspective emphasizes the uniqueness of the individual case that defies comparison. In contrast, the broad universalist (nomothetic, etic, positivist, quantitative) perspective emphasizes what is common between cultures with an emphasis on theoretical predictions, replicability of methods, and empirical testing. Because neither of these apparently mutually exclusive metatheoretical positions is defensible in the extreme, there is a need to bridge this dichotomy. Thus, for example, Kashima (1995) noted the need for future research to identify universal as well as culture-specific antecedents and consequences of self-conceptions. In an emerging consensus on the cultural-mind relation, Kashima (2000) emphasized a system of reciprocal effects whereby agents generate culture but are also shaped by culture. Similarly, Kitayama and Markus (1999) argued for the mutual construction of culture and self.",

Within this context, they noted the need to use new multiplegroup structural equation modeling approaches that allow researchers to make fine-grained comparisons of factor structures and patterns of relations among multiple constructs in different cultural groups. In this framework, there is a focus on similarities as well as differences and an emphasis on the explanation of observed differences. Because of the traditional focus on null hypothesis testing, there is an unfortunate tendency to provide elaborate interpretations for (sometimes very small) differences and largely to ignore similarities that may argue for generalization across cultures. From this perspective, cross-cultural research can be seen as an extremely important variation on the traditional multimethod approach to evaluation of construct validity. Van de Vijer and Leung emphasized that the endemic problems of replicability in cross-culture research will improve with greater emphasis on theory development and testing coupled with the more appropriate use of new statistical tools. When there are parallel data from more than one group-the multiple cultural groups in cross-cultural research-it is possible to test the invariance of the solution by requiring any one, any set, or all parameter estimates to be the same in two or more groups. Byrne (2003) argued that this analysis is particularly appropriate for making cross-cultural comparisons.",

The PISA database was collected in response to the need for internationally comparable evidence of student performance and related competencies within a common framework that is internationally agreed on. Selection of the measures was made on the basis of advice from substantive and statistical expert panels and results from extensive pilot studies. Substantial efforts and resources were devoted to achieving cultural and linguistic breadth in the assessment materials, stringent quality-assurance mechanisms were applied in the translation of materials into different languages, and data were collected under independently supervised test conditions. Paper-and-pencil assessments consisted of a combination of multiple-choice items and written responses. Whereas all students completed some reading assessment items (which were the focus of the 2000 data collection), only random samples of students completed mathematics or science assessments. In addition, countries were given the option of collecting materials on a Cross Curriculum Competencies (CCC) questionnaire that included the academic self-concept items that are the focus of the present investigation. A total of 26 of 32 participating countries chose to do so. Although the response rate in the Netherlands was lower than recommended to ensure a nationally representative sample and comparability with other countries (OECD, 2001b) , the Netherlands was included in the present investigation. The data for the other 25 countries provided nationally representative samples of 15-year-old students in each of these countries.",

Byrne (2003) argued that this analysis is particularly appropriate for making cross-cultural comparisons. In applying this approach, there is a well-developed methodology in which the goodness of fit of alternative models are compared, including the least restrictive model that does not require any of the parameter estimates to be the same in different groups and the most restrictive model that requires all parameter estimates to be the same in the different groups (e.g., Byrne, 1998; Marsh, 1994a ; but also see Cheung & Rensvold, 1999) . In preliminary analyses, we tested the a priori baseline model separately for each of the 26 groups and found that the goodness of fit was excellent for each country considered separately (see subsequent discussion of Table 3 ). Typically, the minimal condition for \"factorial invariance\" is the equivalence of all factor loadings in the multiple groups, and this is one of the first tests of invariance in the sequence. There is no clear consensus in recommendations about the ordering of subsequent invariance constraints (e.g., Bentler, 1988; Bollen, 1989; Byrne, 1998; J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 1993) , although Bentler (1988) and Byrne (1998) noted that the equality of parameters associated with measurement errors is typically the least important hypothesis to test and is unlikely to be met in most applications. Whereas under highly restrictive conditions it is possible to test for the statistical significance of differences between two nested models (e.g., models with and without a particular set of invariance constraints), the concerns about reliance on the chi-square test of statistical significance as a measure of fit for a single model are even greater than for the comparison of two different models. In applied research with real data, the null hypothesis of complete invariance (no differences between groups in parameter estimates) is always false and will lead to rejection of the null hypothesis when based on a sufficiently large sample size. Hence, we again emphasize differences in goodness-of-fit indexes, but also present the chi-square test statistic. More important, however, in the present investigation, the four path coefficients used to test the I/E model (Figure 1 ) are of critical importance and are the focus of specific models designed to evaluate the invariance of these parameters across the 26 countries. Hence, the comparison of results across different countries when these path coefficients are not constrained to be invariant is potentially more useful than goodness-of-fit indexes.",

Inspection of the item-total correlations for each indicator (not shown) indicated that the one negatively worded (reverse-scored) item in the verbal self-concept scale contributed less positively to reliability than the other two positively worded verbal selfconcept items (all math self-concept items were positively worded) and that this pattern of results was consistent across the 26 countries. In the PISA database, mathematics achievement was represented by a single score. Therefore, for purposes of structural equation models in the present investigation, we set its reliability at .90, a conservative value in relation to the corresponding reliability estimate for reading that provides a more realistic estimate than assuming that mathematics achievement is measured without error (see discussion by J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 1993) .",

As predicted, the two horizontal paths relating math achievement to math self-concept (.44) and relating reading achievement to verbal self-concept (.47) were substantial and positive, whereas the two cross paths leading from reading achievement to math self-concept (-.20) and mathematics achievement to verbal self-concept (-.26) were negative. Also of relevance is the observation that the (zero-order) correlation between math and verbal achievement factors (r \u03ed .78) was very large, whereas the corresponding correlation between math and verbal self-concept factors (r \u03ed .10) was substantially lower.

The fit indexes for this model (e.g., TLI \u03ed .97) were very good. Separate analyses of this baseline model conducted with each country indicated that the fit was good in each of the 26 countries considered separately. Thus, for example, the 26 RNIs varied from a low of .968 to a high of .992 (M RNI \u03ed .980; see subsequent discussion of Table 3 ). In the first test of invariance (model MG2), factor loadings were constrained to be equal across the 26 groups. Again, the fit indexes were very good and differed little from those based on the totally noninvariant solution (MG1). This supports the appropriateness of the measures across the 26 groups and satisfies the minimum requirement for factorial invariance. In each of the subsequent CFA models (MG3-MG6 in Table 2), the invariance of the factor loadings was imposed in combination with the invariance of additional sets of parameters-factor variances, factor covariances, and uniquenesses. Although the imposition of these added invariance constraints resulted in small decrements in fit, even the highly restrictive Model MG6 of total invariance (i.e., requiring every parameter to be the same in all 26 groups) provided a good fit to the data that differed only slightly from Model MG1, which had no invariance constraints.

Because factor loadings, path coefficients, and factor variances and covariances were invariant (the same) across the 26 groups, it was only necessary to present one set of parameter estimates (rather than separate sets of parameter estimates for each of the 26 groups). Because uniqueness terms were not held invariant across groups in this model, the 26 separate sets of uniqueness terms were not presented in order to conserve space (but see earlier discussion of reliability estimates; also see Table 3 ). Of particular importance in this highly restrictive multigroup model, MG15, were the cross (negative) paths leading from reading achievement to math self-concept (-.19) and from mathematics achievement to verbal self-concept (-.19) . In addition to providing global support for the I/E model, the invariance of these parameter estimates provided remarkably strong support for the cross-cultural generalizability of predictions based on the I/E model.

First, all of our variables were measured at the individual student level and our substantive focus was on the country level. Second, for the PISA data-as is the case more generally (see Marsh & Rowe, 1996) -there was very little variation in self-concept responses at the school level even though there was substantial variation at the school level for achievement scores. 1 Because essentially all of the parameter estimates of interest in the present investigation involved relations (correlations or path coefficients) with one or the other of the self-concept variables, parameter estimates and their standard errors were not likely to be substantially affected by ignoring the school level (see related discussion by Marsh & Rowe, 1996) .

However, our use of listwise deletion is appropriate under these circumstances in which missing values are determined randomly by design. In addition, there were entire countries or regions within countries (e.g., the non-Flemish part of Belgium and all of the United Kingdom except for Scotland) that chose not to participate in the CCC component of PISA that contained the self-concept items, and these countries were excluded from our analyses. Within some of the countries, however, there were entire schools that chose not to participate in the survey component of PISA that contained the self-concept items and these were also excluded from the present investigation. In some cases, these represented entire regions (e.g., only the Flemish part of Belgium participated and in the United Kingdom only Scotland participated in the CCC option of PISA), which were excluded. However, for students who completed any of the self-concept items, there were very few missing responses (1.6%).

Hence, it is relevant to focus on results from Mexico, Brazil, and Korea. In all three countries, the correlation between math and verbal achievement factors was substantially larger than the corresponding correlation between math and verbal self-concept factors, thus supporting the I/E model. However, the correlation between the two academic self-concept factors in one of these countries-Mexico (r \u03ed .52)-was clearly larger than in the other 25 countries. In all three countries, paths between matching achievement and selfconcept factors (the horizontal paths in Figure 1) were positive, thus supporting the I/E model. However, in Brazil and Mexico, these paths were smaller than in most of the other countries. In all three countries, all of the critical paths between nonmatching self-concept and achievement factors (the diagonal, cross paths in Figure 1 ) were negative, thus supporting the I/E model. However, only two of these six paths were statistically significant (i.e., four are negative, but do not differ significantly from zero). Whereas results based on these three countries provided some support for the I/E model, the strength of this support was weaker than for the other countries. It is, however, also important to emphasize that there is strong support for the I/E model in non-Western countries summarized earlier, particularly in Chinese research (Dai, 2001 (Dai, , 2002 Kong, 2000; Lee et al., 2000; Yeung & Lau, 1998; Yeung & Lee, 1999) . In summary, whereas the results of the present investigation provide strong support for the I/E model, there is a need to further test the generalizability of the results in non-Western countries-particularly those in Asia, South America, Central America, and Africa-in order to more fully evaluate any claims that support for the I/E model is \"universal.\" More generally, the I/E model is likely to be dependent on the existence of a formal school system that emphasizes math and verbal school subjects and would not be likely to be supported in cultures where there was no formal school system.",

                "text": "The extreme domain specificity of academic self-concepts that led to the development of the I/E model and was demonstrated so convincingly in the present investigation has important implications for any lingering debates about the relative importance of unidimensional and multidimensional perspectives of self-concept. Clearly, the relation between self-concepts in particular academic areas and corresponding areas of academic achievement cannot be adequately understood if researchers rely solely on global measures of general self-concept or self-esteem. Indeed, our results demonstrate that not even global measures of academic selfconcept are sufficient to understand the interplay between selfperceptions in different academic domains that is the basis of the internal comparison process in the I/E model. The present investigation also has potentially important theoretical implications for social comparison theory. The theoretical basis for the I/E model extends social comparison theory, positing an internal comparison process in addition to the more typical external comparison process. Specifically, students not only use the performances of other students to form their self-concepts in a particular school subject (the external comparison process), they also use their own performances in other school subjects as a second basis of comparison (the internal comparison process). Although there is clear support for this pattern of results in relation to academic achievements and academic self-concepts, it is also relevant to ask whether similar frame-of-reference effects exist in other areas as well. We suggest that the implications probably have much broader generality. To illustrate this broader generality with a hypothetical example, it is relevant to consider two athletes: (a) a weekend sports enthusiast who is reasonably good at golf, tennis, and a variety of other sports, but who is best at golf (with a handicap of 10) and (b) a professional tennis player who is also a good golfer (with a handicap of 2). Asked how good they were at golf, it would be reasonable for the professional tennis player to say \"pretty good\" (because she is so much better at tennis), whereas the weekend sports enthusiast might say \"good\" (because golf is her best sport). Objectively, the professional tennis player is a better golfer, but if asked to complete self-concept for golf and tennis, the weekend sports enthusiast may have as high or even a higher self-concept of golf than the professional athlete. As illustrated by this example, the critical feature of the internal comparison frame of reference is the use of accomplishments in one arena as a basis of comparison for evaluating accomplishments in another arena. Marsh and Roche (1996) applied this logic in the evaluation of performing arts (PA) self-concepts in dance, music, and drama. For students not attending a PA school and non-PA students in a PA school, there were modest, positive correlations among the four PA self-concept scales. PA students specializing in dance, music, or drama within a PA high school, however, were likely to compare their relative competencies in the different PA domains in forming their PA self-concepts in each domain as well as making comparisons with others. Thus, for example, PA dance students who were also good at drama and music were likely to have lower music and drama self-concepts than non-PA students who were equally able in music and drama-not because PA dance students were less skilled at music and drama than non-PA students, but because their music and drama skills were not nearly as good as their dance skills. Consistent with a priori predictions based on the I/E model, Marsh and Roche found that (a) dance, music, and drama self-concepts were positively correlated for non-PA students, but uncorrelated for PA students and (b) PA students had high self-concepts in their specialty area, but had much lower self-concepts in their nonspecialty areas-lower even than non-PA students who did not specialize in any areas of PA.",

Teachers, in order to understand the academic self-concepts of their students in different content areas, must understand the implications of the I/E model. When teachers were asked to infer the self-concepts of their students (see discussion by Marsh & Craven, 1997) , their responses reflected primarily the external comparison process so that teachers' inferences were not nearly so domain specific as responses by their students; students who were bright in one area tended to be seen as having good academic self-concepts in all areas, whereas students who were not bright in one area were seen as having poor academic self-concept in all areas. Similarly, Dai (2002) reported that inferred self-concept ratings by parents reflected primarily the external comparison process typically emphasized in social comparison research, but not the internal comparison process that is the unique feature of the I/E model. In contrast to inferred self-concept ratings by significant others (teachers and parents), students' academic self-concepts in different domains are extremely differentiated. Hence, understanding the implications of the I/E model will allow significant others to better understand children and to infer children's self-concepts more accurately. Thus, for example, our results demonstrate that even bright students may have an average or below-average selfconcept in their weakest school subject that may seem paradoxical, in relation to their good achievement (good relative to other students, but not to their own performance in other school subjects). Similarly, even poor students may have an average or above-average self-concept in their best school subject that may seem paradoxical in relation to their below-average achievement in that subject. Particularly for poorer students, understanding these principles should assist teachers and parents in giving positive feedback that is credible to students.",

In evaluating this support, it is important to establish the limits of the model's generalizability. Tests of the cross-cultural support for predictions from a theoretical model developed in one culture to another culture provide an important basis for testing this generalizability. Importantly, previous tests of the I/E model have been conducted primarily in western countries and, typically, in those where the native language is English. Although there exists support for the I/E predictions in some non-Western countries-particularly China-I/E studies typically have been based on ad hoc samples within a single country and had idiosyncratic design features that hindered comparisons across different countries. From this respect, the results of the present investigation-based on large, representative samples of students from 26 different countries and common materials-provide a much stronger test of the cross-cultural generalizability of predictions based on the I/E model than any previous research. Because there was good support both for the predictions based on the I/E model and for the generalizability of these results across the 26 countries, the results clearly support the construct validity of the I/E model and its cross-cultural generalizability. Although it may be premature to claim that the predicted pattern of results is universal, the results of our research clearly extend the crosscultural generalizability of support for the I/E model.",
