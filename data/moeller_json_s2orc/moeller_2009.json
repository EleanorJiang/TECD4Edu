These dimensional comparison processes are assumed to result in negative paths from achievement in one subject (e.g., math) to self-concept in another (e.g., the verbal domain). In a study with N = 270 students, we investigated the generalizability of the I/E model to students with learning disabilities. Analyses showed positive correlations between math and German achievement and positive effects of achievement in both subjects on the corresponding domain-specific self-concept.

These generalized, self-related cognitions of ability are regarded as individual traits that can, to a large extent, explain and predict achievement-related behavior. In fact, there is a broad consensus that academic self-concepts, mediated by motivational variables, foster learning processes at school (see, e.g., Byrne 1996; Helmke and Van Aken 1995; Marsh 1990a; Marsh and Hattie 1996; M\u00f6ller and K\u00f6ller 2001a; Shavelson and Bolus 1982 ; see also the meta-analyses of Hansford and Hattie 1982; Valentine et al. 2004) . Research has also shown that academic self-concepts have a significant impact on students' coursework selection in American high schools (Marsh and Yeung 1997) . Educators aiming to foster learning in schools should, therefore, work to enhance students' academic selfconcepts as well as their performance. These findings are particularly relevant with respect to learning disabled students, whose learning difficulties can be expected to have unfavorable effects on the development of their academic self-concepts. These students are particularly likely to set themselves unrealistic goals and to shun appropriate intellectual challenges. In turn, these motivational processes lead to further deterioration in performance. The key role of the self-concept of ability has also been demonstrated in empirical studies on the effects of placement in inclusive classrooms, where self-concept often emerges to be the main dependent variable besides achievement (Prout and Prout 1996) . Several studies have shown that the self-concepts of learning disabled students attending inclusive schools are lower than those of their classmates without learning disabilities (see Chapmann 1988) . Moreover, some studies have reported that learning disabled students enrolled in inclusive classrooms report lower self-concepts than their peers in schools for students with special educational needs. This is assumed to be the result of social comparisons being detrimental to the self-concepts of weaker performing students in the heterogeneous learning environment of an integrative classroom (Crabtree and Rutland 2001) , where upward social comparisons with higher performing classmates predominate. Research also focuses on efforts to cultivate the self-concepts of students with learning disabilities. Meta-analytic approaches (Elbaum and Vaughn 2001) have shown that learning disabled students' self-concepts of ability can be enhanced by measures such as tailoring instruction to the needs of individual students.",

Less is known about the domain-specificity of self-concepts of ability in learning disabled students. However, the works of Marsh and Shavelson (1985) , Shavelson and Marsh (1986) , and Marsh et al. (1988b) have shown that it would be mistaken to assume a general academic self-concept. Although Shavelson et al. (1976) initially worked on the assumption that domain-specific academic selfconcepts (in mathematics, the sciences, the mother tongue, and various other subjects) are strongly intercorrelated and that the shared variance in students' self-concepts in these domains can be traced back to a general academic self-concept, confirmatory factor analyses performed by Marsh et al. (1988b) , for example, have revealed that the academic self-concept can in fact be broken down into two distinct facets: verbal and mathematical self-concept.",

First, they conduct interindividual or social comparisons (external frame of reference), comparing their achievement in a subject with that of their classmates.

In M\u00f6ller and K\u00f6ller (2000) , all correlations between the domain-specific self-concept scales and the report card grades in the respective subjects were greater than r = .60, and the internal consistencies (Cronbach's \u03b1) were greater than .75. In the present study, a six-point response format was used (1 = \"disagree completely\" to 6 = \"agree completely\"). For the following analyses, the responses were reverse coded, aggregated, and means calculated. The internal consistencies proved to be satisfactory (mathematics: \u03b1 = .78; German: \u03b1 = .82). In line with previous studies with other student populations, the correlations with grades (math: r = .51, p < .001; German: r = .34, p < .001) indicate that these domain-specific cognitions of ability are meaningful, and that grades are not the unique predictors of domain-specific self-concept. Note that grades awarded using the six-level grading system implemented throughout Germany-excellent (1), good (2), satisfactory (3), sufficient (4), poor (5), and fail (6)-were also recoded so that high scores indicate a high level of achievement. Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, and interscale correlations for all participants and all scales. The mean grades and self-concepts for the two subjects proved to be almost identical. Achievement in both German and mathematics correlated positively and significantly with the self-concept in the corresponding domain, but there was a near-zero correlation between the two self-concepts. Overall, then, the pattern of results to emerge for the present student population is typical of that found in studies on the I/E model. There were slight gender differences in mathematics grades. The boys' grades (M = 3.86, SD = .97) were somewhat higher than those of the girls (M = 3.57, SD = .95; t (228) = 2.14, p < .05). Accordingly, the boys' self-concepts (M = 4.11, SD = .97) were also somewhat higher than those of the girls (M = 3.69, SD = 1.24; t (250) = 2.62, p < .01).",

Based on key works on the suitability of various indices (Marsh et al. , 1988a , priority is given to the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), which are less sensitive to the sample size than the \u03c7 2 , which was also used in the present study. A model is considered to be a good fit when the TLI is greater than .90, the RMSEA is less than .08, and when \u03c7 2 /d f < 3. Figure 1 shows the resulting path model. The fit statistics indicate that the model is a good fit (TLI = .995, R M S E A = .058, \u03c7 2 /d f = 1.928). In line with our expectations, we observed the pattern between grades and self-concepts that is typical of the I/E model. The math grade has a positive impact (.64, p < .001) on the math self-concept, and a negative impact (\u2212.28, p < .001) on the German self-concept. A similar pattern emerges for the German grade, which has a positive impact (.47, p < .001) on the German self-concept, but a negative impact (\u2212.14, p < .05) on the math self-concept. develop lower self-concepts. By contrast, achievement in one subject has a negative effect on the self-concept in the other subject. This is interpreted as the result of dimensional comparisons. Students who perform better in math than in German develop a lower German self-concept than their grade in the subject would warrant. Conversely, dimensional comparisons have positive effects on a student's better subject, where a more positive self-concept is developed.",

                "text": "These findings clearly show that the I/E model also applies to students with learning disabilities, and thus confirm the assumed domain-specificity of academic selfconcepts in this student population. The implications of this are far-reaching, given that dimensional comparisons can be assumed to have similar effects on domain-specific motivational and behavioral variables. Skaalvik and Rankin (1995) , for example, explored students' intrinsic motivation to engage in math and verbal tasks as well as their general academic motivation, effort, and school anxiety. They found strong positive correlations between academic achievement, on the one hand, and intrinsic motivation, effort, and school anxiety in the corresponding domain, on the other hand, and negative effects on the respective variables in the other domain. K\u00f6ller et al. (2000) found similar effects on domain-specific interests, which were mediated by the corresponding self-concept. They also analyzed the courses that college-bound students chose at upper secondary level, and found that students were more likely to opt for an advanced course in mathematics or English if they had good grades, a high self-concept, and marked interest in the subject. The same factors proved to have a negative impact on the choice of an advanced course in the other subject-clearly an effect of dimensional comparisons. To put it another way, given identical math achievement, students who later opted for an advanced math course reported less interest and a lower self-concept in English than their peers who later chose a basic math course. Transferring these findings to schools for students with special educational needs, it seems safe to assume that learning disabled students also act on their contrasting self-concepts by tending to specialize in their stronger domain. It should be emphasized that these processes of comparison and the ensuing specializations can have both costs and benefits. The costs are that students might tend to neglect their weaker subjects, meaning that their performance in these areas deteriorates even further. The benefits are that the relative strengths of learning disabled students can be developed and decisions about their academic or occupational future can be made more easily. As mentioned above, when Plucker and Stocking (2001) found a similar pattern of results in a sample of gifted students, they concluded that teachers should not work on the assumption that gifted students perceive themselves as performing equally well in all subjects. By the same token, we can conclude that students with learning disabilities do not necessarily perceive their performance in all subjects to be below average. In fact, processes of dimensional comparison make it rather unlikely that students will develop homogeneous concepts of their own ability in different domains. Teachers of learning disabled students should bear this in mind when attempting to gauge their students' domain-specific self-concepts. This is particularly relevant when students in more flexible forms of instruction, such as \"open instruction,\" are allowed to select learning activities based on their subjective assessment of their own ability. Recent findings have shown that teachers tend to neglect the effects of dimensional comparison processes when evaluating their students' self-concepts of ability (Pohlmann et al. 2004) . Particularly where students with learning disabilities are concerned, it would thus be helpful if teachers had a better idea of where their students perceive their own strengths and weaknesses to lie. A possible implication of these findings for classroom practice would thus be to discuss students' strengths with them directly or to focus on these strengths in other ways.",
