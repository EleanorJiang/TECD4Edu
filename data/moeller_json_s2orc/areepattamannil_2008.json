Educators tend to stress the socioeconomic and cultural factors affecting immigrant adolescents' academic achievement to the exclusion of the psychological factors that are also at play in the lives of immigrant adolescents. Therefore, this study examined the impact of psychological indicators, such as academic self-concept and academic motivation, on the academic achievement of immigrant and nonimmigrant adolescents in the Greater Toronto Area secondary schools. The immigrant adolescents in this study performed as well as their nonimmigrant counterparts in English and overall school performance. The immigrant adolescents outperformed their nonimmigrant counterparts in mathematics. The immigrant adolescents had higher levels of math and school self-concepts as well as higher intrinsic and extrinsic motivation than their nonimmigrant counterparts. Math self-concept was the only predictor of math GPA for both immigrant and nonimmigrant adolescents. However, both verbal self-concept and school self-concept were the best predictors of English GPA for both immigrant and nonimmigrant adolescents. While school self-concept was the only predictor of overall GPA for nonimmigrant adolescents, the additional factors of math self-concept and extrinsic motivation-external regulation were the best predictors for immigrant adolescents. of all Canadian school children, and it is projected that by 2017 one in three children will fit this description (Badets, 2003) .",

In sharp contrast to the large volume of research examining the gap in performance between racial/ethnic groups in Canada, there is scant quantitative research examining disparities between immigrants and native-born students to complement the rich qualitative, ethnographic studies of immigrants from specific regions or countries. Furthermore, considering the size and ubiquity of immigrant populations in the schools across Canada, relatively little research has examined the academic motivation, academic self-concept, and academic achievement of these children. Hence, more theoretically and methodologically diverse empirical research is needed to construct a more sophisticated understanding of the motivational psychology for immigrant children in the Canadian school setting.",

Second, high school test scores predict later success in the job market in terms of higher wages ( Joppke & Morawska, 2003) . Finally, lower levels of education and skills are associated with lower levels of economic success, including a greater likelihood of living in poverty and receiving government assistance (Eurydice, 2004) .

Educational initiatives in Canada emphasize the distal factors (i.e., socioeconomic and cultural factors) at the expense of psychological factors, which are proximal. Recent research in social psychology, however, has demonstrated that achievement gaps may be a product of a more general cognitive process that may, as a result, be more amenable to intervention than previously thought (Steele, Spencer, & Aronson, 2002) . Specifically, this kind of research has suggested that individuals may suffer negative performance outcomes (lower standardized test scores and less engagement with academics) because they are burdened by the prospect of confirming cultural stereotypes impugning their intellectual and academic abilities (Good, Aronson, & Inzlicht, 2003) . Therefore, it is imperative to examine the impact of psychological indicators, such as academic self-concept and academic motivation, on the academic achievement of immigrant adolescents.",

Academic self-concept has been strongly linked to academic achievement (Marsh, 1990) . Previous research (Marsh, Trautwein, Ludtke, Koller, & Baumert, 2005) in the context of education has considered academic self-concept as an important psychological construct because \"it has been found to be both a cause and an effect of academic achievement\" (Cokley, 2007, p. 2) .

Historically, self-concept measurement, theory, research, and application emphasized a largely atheoretical and global component of self-concept. However, the most recent models of academic self-concept have been based in a domain-specific perspective that supports a multidimensional view of self-concept. Self-concept had been viewed as a one-dimensional construct until Shavelson, Hubner, and Stanton (1976) propounded a multidimensional, hierarchical model of self-concept, which was based on the early theories of James and Cooley (Byrne & Gavin, 1996) . The Shavelson model is comprised of a global self-concept, which is divided into academic (e.g., math, verbal, science) and nonacademic (e.g., social, physical, emotional) components, suggesting that self-concept is multifaceted, is hierarchically organized, and becomes increasingly differentiated with age. Recently, Guay, Marsh, and Boivin (2003) corroborated that as children become older, the rating of academic self-concept becomes more reliable and more stable. This claim was based on developmental psychological theory suggesting that, as children become older, they have an increased awareness of themselves and the world around them.",

An adolescent's math self-concept can differ significantly from his or her verbal self-concept; therefore, a high math academic self-concept does not necessarily predict a high verbal academic self-concept. Because this finding was in contrast to the Shavelson model, Marsh (1986 developed the Internal/External frames of reference model (I/E model) to explain the difference between virtually uncorrelated math and verbal academic self-concept scores. Within the internal frame of reference, students evaluate their own performance in any particular school subject in relation to their performance in other school subjects. Therefore, a hierarchy of academic selfconcept is created by the individual in reference to the individual's ability in all other school subjects. Within the external frame of reference, students compare their self-perceived performance in any particular school subject with the perceived performance of other students in the same school. This external reference serves as a basis for students' math and verbal self-concepts. For example, if a student's verbal achievement is higher than his or her classmates' achievement, then his or her verbal self-concept tends to be higher as well. Because achievements in math and verbal school subjects are typically positively correlated, these social comparisons lead to the expectation that domain-specific math and verbal self-concepts are positively correlated as well. The two frames of reference work in opposition to each other. This explains why math and English self-concept are often uncorrelated with each other.",

In summary, there was a positive and reciprocal relationship between academic self-concept and academic achievement.

Autonomy implies that individuals experience choice in the initiation, maintenance, and regulation of their behaviors (Deci & Ryan, 1985 . Central to the theory is the distinction between autonomous and controlled motivation. Autonomous motivation involves acting with a full sense of volition and choice, and it encompasses both intrinsic motivation and well-internalized (i.e., integrated) extrinsic motivation (Deci & Ryan, 1985 . Controlled motivation, in contrast, involves acting with a sense of pressure or demand and includes regulation by external contingencies and by contingencies that have been partially internalized (i.e., introjected; Deci & Ryan, 1985 . Only autonomously motivated behaviors are considered fully self-determined because these motivations are either innate to the active organism-that is, are part of the inherent, core self-or have been fully assimilated with the core self through the process of organismic integration (Deci & Ryan, 2002) .",

Therefore, SDT delineates three types of psychological needs: the need for competence, the need for autonomy, and the need for relatedness (Deci & Ryan, 1985 . The need for competence is the need to experience satisfaction in improving one's abilities (Deci & Ryan, 1985 , and competence is a facilitator of intrinsic motivation.

While applying SDT to academic motivation, intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation are the two primary types of motivated academic behavior (Cokley, 2003) . Intrinsic motivation is the drive to pursue an activity simply for the pleasure or satisfaction derived from it (Deci, 1975) . Therefore, intrinsic motivation is the most selfdetermined form of motivation (Vallerand & Ratelle, 2002) . For instance, students who enjoy doing their homework are intrinsically motivated. Initially, theorists argued that intrinsic motivation was unidimensional in nature. Later, Vallerand and his colleagues (Vallerand, 1993; Vallerand, Blais, Briere, & Pelletier, 1989; Vallerand et al., 1992) proposed a tripartite taxonomy of intrinsic motivation: intrinsic motivation to know, intrinsic motivation to accomplish, and intrinsic motivation to experience stimulation. Intrinsic motivation to know refers to the desire to perform an activity for the enjoyment one receives while exploring, learning, and understanding new things (Vallerand, 1997) . Intrinsic motivation to accomplish refers to the desire to perform an activity for the pleasure and satisfaction that one receives from accomplishing or creating new things. Finally, individuals who participate in an activity for the pleasure and satisfaction derived while experiencing pleasurable intellectual or physical sensations are intrinsically motivated to experience stimulation.",

In other words, rewards and constraints regulate these behaviors. For example, a student who performs an activity to satisfy external demands (e.g., a tangible reward or punishment) or social contingency is externally regulated. Next along the autonomy continuum is the construct of extrinsic motivation-introjected regulation. These behaviors are controlled in part by the environment but also by internal reward/punishment contingencies (e.g., ego enhancement, guilt, shame, or obligation). An example is students who perform their schoolwork because they do not want to let their parents down. Hence, introjected regulation encompasses a moderately low degree of self-determination. Further along the self-determination continuum, extrinsic motivationidentified regulation refers to behaviors that are performed by choice because the individual judges them to be important. For instance, a student with identified regulation engages in a particular behavior as long as she or he perceives the usefulness or instrumental value of doing so. In contrast to introjected regulation, identified regulation encompasses a moderately high degree of self-determination. Therefore, identified regulation is a relatively autonomous form of extrinsic motivation.",

When individuals are amotivated, they do not perceive a contingency between their behaviors and outcomes (Vallerand et al., 1992) . \"A highly probable consequence of academic motivation is to quit the activity toward which the individual is amotivated\" (Vallerand & Ratelle, 2002, p. 43 ). Because the students who are amotivated are neither intrinsically motivated nor extrinsically motivated, they may decide to drop out of school. Considerable research in the educational realm (Black & Deci, 2000; Noels, Clement, & Pelletier, 2001; Vallerand et al., 1993) suggests that positive indices of student functioning are associated with high levels of autonomous motivations, whereas negative indices are associated with high levels of controlled motivations and amotivation (see Deci & Ryan, 2000 , for a review).",

                "text": "Although academic motivation based on SDT has received little attention in the study of immigrant adolescents' academic outcomes, recent research based on SDT suggests that self-determined motivation is closely related to important behavioral outcomes (see Cokley, 2003; Vallerand & Ratelle, 2002) . Undoubtedly, students who are more intrinsically motivated are more likely to stay in school than students who are less intrinsically motivated (Deci & Ryan, 2002) . Much research substantiates that intrinsic motivation is linked to positive academic performance Vallerand et al., 1993) , more enjoyment of academic work and more satisfaction with school (Vallerand et al., 1989) , greater conceptual learning (Benware & Deci, 1984) , and higher self-esteem (Deci, Schwartz, Sheinman, & Ryan, 1981) . On the other hand, students who are more extrinsically motivated experience greater anxiety and a poorer ability to cope with failures (Deci & Ryan, 2000) . In addition, a variety of both correlational and experimental research (see Reeve, Deci, & Ryan, 2004 , for an overview) has documented the advantages of autonomous compared with controlled motivation for studying among school student populations. These include higher well-being (Levesque, Zuehlke, Stanek, & Ryan, 2004) , deep-level learning (Grolnick & Ryan, 1987) , higher grades (Black & Deci, 2000) , greater persistence with learning a second language (Noels et al., 2001) , and lower dropout rates (Hardre & Reeve, 2003) .",

Approximately 67% of the students in the school with high proportions of immigrant adolescents were immigrant students, whereas only 42% of the students in the school with high proportions of Canadian-born/nonimmigrant students were immigrant students. The principals of these two schools allowed us to contact grade 11 and 12 teachers in the respective schools. Teachers from 14 classes in the immigrant majority school and 17 classes in the immigrant minority school agreed to allow us to explain the study to their students and hand out letters of information (800 in total, 400 at each school).

Vallerand et al. (1992) reported that Cronbach's coefficient \u03b1 for the subscales ranged from .83 to .86, with the exception of the identified subscale of extrinsic motivation, which had an internal consistency of .62. In addition, internal consistency for the subscales ranged from .60 to .86 with another English-speaking sample (Vallerand et al., 1993) . Vallerand and his colleagues hypothesized that a simplex pattern would be revealed among the ordered subscales of the AMS as one moved along the motivation continuum. Examination of correlations of the subscales and correlations between the subscales and motivational antecedents and consequences provided support for construct validity (Vallerand et al., 1993 , as cited in Cokley et al., 2001 . Although Cokley (2000b) and Fairchild et al. (2005) found limited support for the simplex structure of the AMS, Cokley et al. (2001) , consistent with Vallerand et al.'s (1992) findings, found support for the seven factor structure of the AMS. Whereas Cokley et al.'s (2001) findings provided only partial support for the construct validity of scores from the AMS, Fairchild et al.'s (2005) study reported adequate model fit for the seven factor model and adequate reliability for the seven subscales (.77 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 .90). Recently, Barkoukis et al. (2008) reproduced the seven factor structure proposed by Vallerand et al. (1992) .

The SDQ-II was developed for junior high and high school students in grades 7-10; however, it is appropriate for students in grades 7-12. The SDQ-II contains 102 items to measure self-concept in adolescents using 11 subscales. The three academic subscales are Mathematics, Verbal, and General School; the seven nonacademic subscales are Physical Ability, Physical Appearance, Opposite-Sex Relations, Same-Sex Relations, Parent Relations, Honesty-Trustworthiness, and Emotional Stability. The SDQ-II also contains one General Self-Concept subscale. All 102 items are measured on a 6-point Likert-type scale (false, mostly false, more false than true, more true than false, mostly true, and true; Marsh, 1992) . Half of the items for each subscale are negatively worded; these items are intended to reduce positive response bias. In the present study, all negatively worded items were reverse scored. Moreover, for the purposes of the present study, we collapsed the SDQ-II into a 30-item scale, which consisted of three academic subscales: Mathematics (10 items), Verbal (10 items), and General School (10 items). We made this decision because we were primarily interested in nonimmigrant and immigrant adolescents' academic self-concept. Marsh (1992) reported measures of internal consistency for SDQ-II scores for a sample of 5,494 students in grades 7-12. Internal consistency ranged from .83 to .91 for scores on all 11 subscales (Marsh, 1992) . The following alpha levels were obtained for each subscale in this study: Math Self-Concept (.92), Verbal Self-Concept (.85), and School Self-Concept (.86). Reliabilities were similar across immigrant and nonimmigrant groups. The alpha coefficients were comparable to those reported by other researchers.",

However, there were no differences between nonimmigrant and immigrant adolescents in terms of their extrinsic motivation-identified regulation. Previous research conducted in the United States (e.g., suggests that students with immigrant parents have higher academic motivation than students with native-born parents. Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that students from immigrant families share a common sense of family obligation, and this obligation partly accounts for their greater academic motivation Fuligni, Tseng, & Lam, 1999) . Moreover, among immigrant families, educational pursuits are an important way for youths to fulfill their lifelong obligations to assist their families and to repay their immigrant parents for their investments and sacrifices (Tseng, 2001) .",

Furthermore, congruent with previous research (Marsh & Yeung, 1998) , math and verbal selfconcepts exhibited moderate or near zero correlations. According to Marsh (1990) , the relative strength of each frame of reference explains the low correlations between math and verbal selfconcepts that have been observed in empirical research. This is because internal comparison leads to math/verbal self-concept correlations that are substantially lower than the correlations between math and verbal achievement levels. Although math GPA is negatively correlated with verbal self-concept of nonimmigrant adolescents, English GPA is not negatively correlated with math self-concept for immigrant adolescents. In contrast to the relationship between English GPA and math self-concept in the study, Marsh's (1986) I/E model predicts negative direct effects of verbal achievement on math self-concept.",

Although extrinsic motivation-external regulation was correlated with overall GPA for immigrant adolescents and intrinsic motivation to know as well as intrinsic motivation to accomplish was correlated with overall GPA for nonimmigrant adolescents, the correlations were not substantial. Contrary to Vallerand et al.'s (1993) hypotheses and in line with previous research (Cokley et al., 2001) , the results of the study indicate that the three intrinsic motivation subscales and the three extrinsic motivation subscales are not correlated with English and math GPA for both nonimmigrant and immigrant adolescents. The failure to find a relationship between academic motivation and academic achievement in the study may be related to the inconsistencies found in previous research (Cokley, 2000a (Cokley, , 2001 with respect to construct validity of the AMS.

First, although the sample size used in this study was adequate, the use of a larger sample size would have allowed for more subgroup analyses, including the ability to conduct multiple regression analyses on the basis of ethnicity. According to Tabachnick and Fidell (2001) , a rule of thumb for testing beta coefficients is to have sample size equal to or greater than 104. In addition, as the sample size of some ethnic groups in the study is very small, we did not examine differences in academic achievement, academic motivation, and academic self-concept across ethnic groups. This inability to conduct appropriate statistical tests with respect to ethnicity is unfortunate as \"modern education needs cross cultural psychology\" (Triandis, 2001, p. 1) to understand how all students function in today's multiethnic schools. Earley and colleagues (Earley, 1994 (Earley, , 1999 Earley, Gibson, & Chen, 1999) found that people respond differently to training and instruction depending on their cultural background. Future cross-cultural exploration of psychological constructs such as academic self-concept and academic motivation might profitably examine the processes through which different ethnic groups acquire the self-understanding and motivational beliefs of the majority group by accessing larger sample sizes than the present study.",

Various authors have alluded to the possibility of systematic differences in response styles between populations defined in terms of culture (e.g., Johnson & van de Vijver, 2003) . Response bias is \"a systematic tendency to respond to a range of questionnaire items on some other basis than the specific item content\" (Paulhus, 1991, p. 17) .

Although cross-sectional research is often the only affordable approach in terms of both financial and time investment, it remains inherently limited. Fuligni (2001) argued that longitudinal research is an essential research strategy if we are to understand the assimilation patterns of immigrant adolescents. Yet, to date, only a handful of such studies have been conducted. Fuligni offered a methodological plea for longitudinal research that follows the same children as they encounter and negotiate differences in the cultural traditions of the motherland and the new society. He noted that a series of cross-sectional studies established a seemingly \"disconcerting effect of acculturation\" (p. 568). These studies have led many to conclude that the longer adolescents of immigrant origin are in the new context, the worse they seem to perform academically. Fuligni eloquently delineated the limitations of cross-sectional research with this population and concluded that only with longitudinal research can acculturative changes be separated from normative developmental shifts. Therefore, more longitudinal research, such as Fuligni is conducting, would prove beneficial.",

Hence, immigrant students in this study performed as well as or better than their nonimmigrant counterparts. The comparatively positive situation of immigrant students in Canada may, in part, be a result of selective immigration policies resulting in immigrant populations with greater wealth and education. Immigrant students in the current study report higher levels of math and school self-concepts and academic motivation than their nonimmigrant peers. The results of this study suggest that adolescents who are motivated to achieve and who have high academic self-concepts are more likely to achieve in the educational domain. Therefore, appropriate programs must be tailored to positively influence these psychological indicators of educational well-being of nonimmigrant adolescents.",

Conversely, deficiencies among lower-performing students in mathematics can have negative consequences for individuals' labour market and earnings prospects and for their capacity to participate fully in society. (p. 323) Therefore, school boards, schools, parents of nonimmigrant adolescents, and their math teachers must identify mathematics as a priority for improvement. No doubt, addressing the increasing demand for mathematical skills requires excellence throughout education systems (OECD, 2007) . However, the disparities in student performance in mathematics, evident from the findings of the present study, suggest that excellence throughout education systems still remains a remote goal and that schools in the GTA need to serve a wide range of student abilities, including those who perform exceptionally well and also those most in need. Schools and teachers need \"to be able to engage constructively with heterogeneity not only in student abilities but also in their characteristics as learners and their approaches to learning\" (OECD, 2004, p. 154) . In addition, it may be essential to monitor how well schools in the GTA provide nonimmigrant students with fundamental mathematical skills.",
