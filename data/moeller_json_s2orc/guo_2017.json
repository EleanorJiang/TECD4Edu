However, much of this research has focused on motivational beliefs in general science, whereas science choices and aspirations are often measured in specific science domains. Indeed, the process of subject selection is inherently comparative. For example, let us consider the decision to major in physics at college. Students will be most likely to select this major only if they hold high confidence in their ability to do well in the course required by this major and place high value on majoring in physics by comparing the physics major to other majors including other science domains (see Eccles, 2009) . Such intraindividual dimensional comparisons have been found to be useful for predicting academic choices. Nevertheless, existing research has focused almost exclusively on the dimensional comparison processes between math and verbal domains (e.g., Parker et al., 2012) .",

First, contrasting achievement and motivation, we tested how students' subject-specific selfconcept and intrinsic and utility values in science were shaped by dimensional comparisons. Second, extending theoretical developments based on DCT, we explored how such dimensional comparison processes predicted coursework aspirations across different science domains. Third, extending recent developments based on EVT, we tested how academic self-concept interacted with value beliefs in predicting aspirations.",

TIMSS has been a major basis of international comparisons of countries in terms of educational motivation and achievement in the four major science domains. Thus, it presents an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to investigate students' motivational pathways to different STEM-related fields. This study was among the first to take advantage of the TIMSS data to address this substantive issue. In order to test the cross-national generalizability of our results, we rely on a convenience sample of all OECD countries who chose to conduct separate motivation assessments in physics, chemistry, biology and earth science, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, and Sweden (Olson, Martin, & Mullis, 2008) . We note that the current approach, aiming to identify pan-human generalizations rather than country-specific idiosyncratic effects, is well-aligned with the approach typically taken in the study of similar educational phenomenon (e.g., the Internal-External frames of reference [I/E] model, the Big-Fish Little-Pond effect) using large international data sets (Marsh et al., 2014 , Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, Nagengast, Trautwein, & Abduljabbar, 2015 .",

In order to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, students compare and contrast their own performances across different school disciplines (M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) . The I/E model were originally developed to explain the apparently paradoxical relations among domain-specific selfconcepts and achievement: near zero-correlations between math and verbal self-concepts despite math and verbal achievement being moderately to strongly correlated (Marsh, 2007) . The I/E model posits that students form their verbal and math selfconcepts as a function of two underlying processes: social and dimensional comparison. Using an external frame of reference, students conduct social comparisons by comparing their selfperceived performance in a subject domain with that of their peers in the same school or classroom. For instance, if students have higher math achievement than do their classmates, their math selfconcept is also likely to be higher. Thus, the social comparison processes lead to a positive prediction from achievement and selfconcept within a subject domain. Employing a dimensional frame of reference, students conduct dimensional comparisons by comparing their performances in one particular subject domain against their performance in other subject domains. However, the dimensional comparison processes are ipsative, so that high levels of math ability should lead to lower verbal self-concept once the positive effect of verbal ability is controlled for.",

                "text": "Recently, the I/E model has been extended into DCT (M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) by incorporating a wider variety of subject domains. DCT postulates that academic self-concepts are formed by different dimensional comparisons. On the one hand, contrasting dimensional comparison processes predict that good performance in one domain leads to lower self-concept in other domains (i.e., contrast effects). On the other hand, assimilating dimensional comparison processes are characterized by good performance in one domain leading to higher self-concept in other domains (i.e., assimilation effects). Whether students engage in contrasting or assimilating dimensional comparisons is related to their beliefs as to whether two abilities are negatively or positively correlated (M\u20ac oller, Helm, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, Nagy, & Marsh, 2015) . One of the critical assumptions of DCT is that perceived subject similarity corresponds to the verbal-mathematical continuum of core academic selfconcept domains (M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) . This assumption has been well supported in both empirical and experimental studies. For example, Haag and G\u20ac otz (2012) demonstrated that subjects (far from each other on the continuum, e.g., math vs. German) with low self-concept correlations were perceived as rather dissimilar and that subjects (close to each other, e.g., math vs. physics) with high self-concept correlations are perceived as more similar. A recent empirical study (Helm, Mueller-Kalthoff, Nagy, & Moller, 2016) also confirmed this assumption and addressed that contrast effects were stronger when students focus on differences between two subject domains than when they focused on similarities. Thus, according to the verbal-mathematical continuum of academic selfconcept, assimilation effects are assumed to occur between \"near\" domains, whereas contrast effects are assumed to occur between \"far\" domains.",

Dimensional comparisons are assumed to serve as a critical source of information as to students' strength and weakness across different domains. These self-evaluations would help students to distinguish domains in which they can specialize, and for which they could develop particular interests, emotions, and preferences. Thus, dimensional comparisons are underlying mechanisms for the process of self-differentiation to serve motivational needs (M\u20ac oller et al., 2015). In this regard, the GI/E model assumption has been tested with respect to emotions (Goetz, Frenzel, Hall, & Pekrun, 2008) , intrinsic and utility values (Nagy et al., 2008; Schurtz, Pfost, Nagengast, & Artelt, 2014) , and perceptions of the learning environment (Arens & M\u20ac oller, 2016) . For example, Schurtz et al. (2014) found negative contrast effects from grades to intrinsic value between math and English, following the typical I/E pattern. However, the negative impact of dimensional comparisons on intrinsic value was totally mediated by selfconcepts (also see Nagy et al., 2008) .",

More importantly, these relative motivational beliefs are postulated to play important roles to link between achievement and behavioral choices and aspirations in EVT. All such behaviors are also assumed to be associated with costs, as one choice often eliminates other options (an ipsative process), and thus trigger dimensional comparison of achievement and motivation (Eccles, 2009) . Put simply, individual differences in relative self-concept and task value attached to a domain compared to other domains influence course enrollment (Nagy et al., 2008) .

By comparing their performance in math and English, high school students who had better performance in math tended to become more confident and interested in math but less in English. Subsequently, the positive motivation in math led these students to choose an advanced math course but opt out of an advanced English course.

According to TIMSS, earth science is concerned with the study of earth and its place in the solar system and the universe, covering the fields of geology, astronomy, meteorology, hydrology and oceanography (Olson et al., 2008) . For the four targeted countries, earth science is taught as a separate natural science subject along with biology, chemistry, and physics in Czech Republic and Hungary; although earth science is not taught separately, it is mainly represented in physics and chemistry and only included as a small part of the social sciences subject of geography in Slovenia and Sweden (Olson et al., 2008, see Table 1 ). Thus, we expect that earth science is more closely related to the mathematical side than the verbal side of the verbal-mathematical continuum. More precisely, we hypothesize that earth science is located in the middle of physics/chemistry and biology on the continuum, given that topics covered in the teaching and learning of earth science are largely intertwined with some concepts also covered in biology, physics, and chemistry. However, given the absence of empirical evidence for this, we still leave cross-paths involving earth science as a research question to be explored.",

Of particular importance were the substantial path coefficients between paths from achievement to motivation constructs in matching domains compared to those in non-matching domains. To clarify these critical path coefficients, we computed summary statistics for matching paths, nonmatching paths, and their difference (see Appendix E).

In the mediation model (MG10) achievements in the four science domains predicted self-concepts, which in turn predicted intrinsic and utility values. In this model, the four domainspecific self-concepts and values along with achievements were also allowed to predict coursework aspirations. However, it is important to emphasize that the goodness of fit of this mediation model (MG10) is necessarily the same as the original nonmediation model (MG7b), as are the total (direct \u00fe indirect) effects of achievement; that is some of the effects interpreted as direct effects in MG7b are now are now interpreted as mediated effects in MG10, but the total effects are the same. The results revealed that all 32 direct paths from the four science achievements to each of the intrinsic and utility values were relatively small (from \u00c00.05 to 0.05; M \u00bc 0.01) in the mediation model. Subsequently, we evaluated a nested model where these 32 direct paths were constrained to be 0. There was a negligible decrease in model fit (DCFI \u00bc 0.002, DTLI \u00bc 0.001, DRMSEA \u00bc 0.001) when compared to the fully mediated model. Consistent with previous research these results can be interpreted to mean that the statistically significant total effects of achievements on intrinsic and task value are largely mediated by self-concept. Although the cross-sectional nature of our data dictate caution in the interpretation of the mediation model, the total effects in the mediation model (MG10) are the same as the direct effects in the original non-mediation model (MG7b). In this sense, the interpretations of total effects in the mediation model are the same as those of the direct effects in We began with an evaluation of models without latent interactions. Consistent with predictions from Hypothesis 2a, matching paths from self-concept, intrinsic value and utility value in each domain to coursework aspirations, were substantially positive, controlling for achievement (see Fig. 2 ).

Although the imposition of the additional constraints on structural coefficients resulted in some decreases in model fit, these decreases were negligible, and all models provided a satisfactory level of fit to the data. To more directly compare the similarity of country-specific path coefficients, we also calculated a profile similarity index (PSI). The PSI is an estimate of the correlations between path coefficients obtained from different countries. For all path coefficients based on Model 7a, the PSI indicated the very high level of similarity across the four countries (range from 0.861 to 0.957, see Appendix H for country-specific path coefficients).

More importantly, our findings supported the crucial assumption of DCT that student tend to make both assimilating or contrasting dimensional comparisons, which is related to perceived subject similarity. Specifically, students are likely to engage in contrasting dimensional comparison between physics and biology which are separated by the greatest distance on the continuum of academic self-concepts (relative to other science domains).

This finding suggests that when students perceive school subjects to be similar (e.g., physics and biology), intrinsic motivation in one is likely to generalize to the other, whereas when they perceive those subjects to be distinct (physics vs. biology), liking of one subject domain tends to wane if students have high achievement in the other domain. However, the pattern of results for utility value was somewhat weaker than that for intrinsic value. A theoretical reason may be that utility value is more related to an individual's personal and collective identities, whereas intrinsic value is more related to performance-based experiences. The formation of utility value may rely on other sources, such as cultural and parent subjective norms (Wigfield, Tonks, & Klauda, 2016) . Put simply, parents who value math are likely to communicate these beliefs to children as a way for children to understand that math is important and useful, which can influence students' own valuing of math. Another reason might be that students are not able to distinguish utility value in different science subjects at Grade 9, as evident by the low degree of domain specificity of utility value (see Appendix D). The domain specificity of the construct is one of the bases underlying dimensional comparison mechanisms. The pattern of relations between the motivational factors and achievement is largely a function of the domain-specific nature of this factor. Previous research has suggested that a lower degree of domain specificity for the motivational constructs is associated with weaker support for the I/E model (Marsh et al., 2013) .",

Importantly, this study is among the first to test latent expectancy-by-value interactions for multiple science domains within the same model. There is strong evidence of the high domain specificity of interactive relations in predicting coursework aspirations. The interactive roles of self-concept and value suggest that students with both high science self-concept and task value are more likely to aspire to engage in science. However, students with high self-concept are unlikely to desire to pursue science in the future, if they ascribe a low level of intrinsic value to science. Similarly, students who value math are also unlikely to desire to enter a scientific career, if their science self-concept remains low. Therefore, this study provides strong support for the theoretical claim that self-concept and value interact in predicting achievement-related outcomes.",

This means that for example, students who have high self-concept and interest in physics but even higher self-concept and interest in biology are likely to have lower aspirations in physics compared to students who have the same level of self-concept and interest in physics but lower self-concept and interest in biology. Thus, aspirations in one science domain depend not only on abilities, selfconcept, and intrinsic value in that domain, but also on relative abilities and motivation in other science domains. These findings shed further light on the important roles played by dimensional comparison processes in shaping academic pathways to different STEM fields, and underline the importance of differentiating motivational beliefs across science domains.",

Based on TIMSS data, the present study evaluated the only four available participating OECD countries that assessed students' motivational beliefs in the four science domains. Despite substantial variations in the sociocultural and educational background (see Table 1 ), the pattern of results is invariant across the four countries, supporting the external validity of our findings. Particularly, the cross-cultural support for the generalizability of DCT predictions reflects a broader tendency of students to engage in both assimilating and contrasting dimensional comparisons to develop their self-concept, task values, and aspirations in science. Our results indicate that even students who excel at science, particularly in physics, might have high selfconcept and values in both physics and chemistry; however, they might have an average or below average self-concept and values in biology, which may seem paradoxical in relation to their good achievement (better compared to other students but not compared to their own performance in other science domains). This indication is inconsistent with teachers' perception of formation of students' motivation. Previous studies have shown that teachers tend to believe that students who are capable in one academic domain tend to be seen as having high self-concept and values in all domains, while students who are not capable in one area are seen as having low self-concept and values in all domains (Marsh, 2007) .",

Understanding such comparison processes would also help teachers provide effective feedback to students. In particular, attributional feedback, goal feedback, and contingent praise, as forms of constructive feedback, have been identified as effective methods of boosting self-concept (O'Mara, Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 2006) .

This is particularly the case as students move into higher education. Thus, research across different international samples covering multiple age groups, school subjects and schooling systems would be useful, to clarify the generalizability of our findings. Third, our findings support the assumption that students make assimilating or contrasting dimensional comparisons are related to how they perceive similarity of two or more domains These results are also consistent with the experimental studies suggesting that lower perceived subject similarity would lead to stronger selfconcept differences than did higher perceived similarity (Helm et al., 2016) .
