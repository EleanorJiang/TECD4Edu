Whereas academic self-concept encompasses self-ratings of achievement, peer academic reputation (PAR) encompasses peer ratings of the same achievement and PAR was shown to have an incremental predictive effect on a range of positive academic outcomes. Considering the importance of PAR, we hypothesized that the I/E model would also apply to PAR both as predictor and as outcome. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 850 seventhgrade students in 47 classes in math and English. Therein, PAR was measured in a round-robin design where students rated each classmate's level of achievement. We tested I/E models with academic selfconcept and PAR as outcomes. Results supported the I/E model for academic self-concept as outcome with academic achievement and PAR as predictor but not for PAR as outcome with achievement as predictor. For PAR as outcome, the effects across domains were positive rather than negative. These results were consistent across replications over three years using the same sample. Thus, whereas academic self-concept was characterized by contrasts between domains, PAR was characterized by assimilation between domains.",

The internal/external frame of reference model (I/E model; Marsh, 1986) highlights the effect of dimensional comparisons between students' achievement in math and their achievement in a verbal subject (e.g., English). For instance, students who are better at math than English will have a more positive rating of their math achievement and, likewise, a more negative rating of their English achievement. There is ample empirical support for the I/E model when it comes to self-ratings in the form of academic self-concept (M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013; M\u20ac oller, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, Helm, Nagy, & Marsh, 2016; M\u20ac oller, Pohlmann, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2009) .",

Thereby, students' PAR matters theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, PAR can be described as a precursor to self-perception (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) , and empirically, PAR has been found to be an important predictor of students' motivation, achievement, anddto some degreedtheir academic choices (Chen, Hughes, Liew, & Kwok, 2010; Denissen, Sch\u20ac onbrodt, van Zalk, Meeus, & van Aken, 2011; Gest et al., 2005; Gest, Rulison, Davidson, & Welsh, 2008; Hughes, Dyer, Luo, & Kwok, 2009) . Thus, PAR is relevant to the I/E model in a twofold way. First, PAR might predict academic selfconcept in a manner that is similar to achievement. Second, the I/ E model has the potential to explain the formation of PAR. Yet, so far, the evidence is not conclusive (M\u20ac oller, Helm, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, Nagy, & Marsh, 2015) .",

The multidimensional model of selfconcept (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) arranges academic domains on a continuum ranging from verbal to mathematical. Dimensional comparisons between domains that are farther apart on the continuum (e.g., math and English) should have stronger (contrast) effects than dimensional comparisons between domains that are closer (e.g., math and physics). One experiment (Helm, Mueller-Kalthoff, Nagy, & M\u20ac oller, 2016 ) and a number of observational studies have supported this reasoning and found no effects or even positive (assimilation) effects for near comparisons (Jansen, Schroeders, L\u00fcdtke, & Marsh, 2015; Marsh et al., 2014; Marsh, L\u00fcdtke, et al., 2015; M\u20ac oller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & K\u20ac oller, 2006; Xu et al., 2013) . Similarly, students who believed in a negative correlation between mathematical and verbal abilities showed stronger contrast effects for dimensional comparisons between these domains (M\u20ac oller, Streblow, & Pohlmann, 2006) .",

Similarly, Hughes et al.

Chen et al. (2010) added to these results by finding that PAR predicted achievement on a standardized test 3 years later, when prior achievement, IQ, and economic status were controlled for. Therein, the effect of PAR on achievement was mediated by general academic self-concept and engagement. Finally, Denissen et al.

Similar to general academic self-concept (Brunner et al., 2010) , PAR has often been measured as a domain-general construct (i.e., not specific to English or math; Chen et al., 2010; Gest et al., 2005; Gest et al., 2008; Hughes et al., 2009) . Nevertheless, for both academic self-concept and other kinds of selfperceptions of achievement, meta-analyses have shown that the correlation between self-perception and an achievement criterion is higher when both are measured at the same level of specificity (M\u20ac oller et al., 2009; Valentine, DuBois, & Cooper, 2004) . For instance, the correlation between domain-specific self-concept and domain-specific achievement is higher than the correlation between general self-concept and domain-specific achievement. Similar to academic self-concept, domain-specific PAR may be more closely associated with domain-specific achievement. Moreover, studies by Marsh and colleagues (Marsh, 1986; Marsh, Smith, & Barnes, 1984) have indicated that at least peers' inferences of another student's self-concept are domain-specific as well.",

Bringing the two phenomena together has the potential to improve the understanding of both. The role of PAR in the I/E model can be twofold. First, PAR can be conceptualized as a predictor of selfconcept. Second, PAR can be conceptualized as an outcome in the I/E model. First, PAR in math and in a verbal domain such as English can be tested as a predictor of academic self-concept in these domains. In general, this idea is in line with the theoretical and empirical results presented above. There, we explained that what others think about a student might be relevant for the student's self-perception (e.g., Leary & Baumeister, 2000; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . Furthermore, parents' ratings of achievement predicted their child's academic self-concept (Dai, 2002) , and moreover, PAR has been found to predict academic self-concept (e.g., Gest et al., 2005) . Considering PAR in two domains as a predictor of academic self-concept in two domains thus provides an extension of earlier studies. Furthermore, this notion fits with the recent extension of the I/E model that makes it possible to include a broader set of domain-specific predictors (M\u20ac oller et al., 2016) . Recently, Helm et al. (2017) found that peer feedback predicted self-ratings of personality in the Big Two. Thus, in line with recent developments in the I/E model, peer ratings such as PAR might predict self-concept in academic domains as well.",

As outlined above, achievement has been found to predict PAR, at least when they are measured as domain-general constructs (e.g., Gest et al., 2008) . However, considering the evidence on DCT, the I/E model can potentially help account for the formation of PAR when considered in English and math. This reasoning was outlined by M\u20ac oller et al. (2015) who hypothesized that \"dimensional comparisons influence evaluations of and by other people and groups\" (p. 430). This hypothesis is based on the idea that ratings (including achievement ratings) are always made with regard to some frame of reference (Kahneman & Miller, 1986) . Evidence that the I/E model applies to a wide range of ratings corroborates the notion of a dimensional reference for PAR. Furthermore, the dissimilarity of domains such as English and mathddescribed as a major determinant of the I/E modeldshould be the same in peer and selfperception.",

For instance, Van Zanden et al. 2017demonstrated that with parents as perceivers, the I/E model could be found for inferred self-concepts but not for parents' ratings of achievement. In addition, whereas PAR was measured on the basis of multiple classmates' ratings of a target student (Gest et al., 2005) , the observational studies mentioned above measured inferred selfconcepts by asking single students to rate one target student Pohlmann et al., 2004) . If only single perceivers rate a target, these ratings may be confounded with idiosyncratic tendencies, leading to inflated correlations between ratings (Nestler & Back, 2015) . Studies on interpersonal perception employing multiple perceivers per target show that about 20% of the variance in interpersonal ratings is accounted for by idiosyncratic rating tendencies (termed the relationship effect; Hoyt & Kerns, 1999; Kenny, 1994) . Having multiple perceivers assess each target controls for these idiosyncratic tendencies. For instance, studies that used vignettes (and supported the I/E model with regard to ratings by others) were based on multiple perceivers per target (Dickh\u20ac auser, 2005; M\u20ac oller, 2005) . Taken together, there are reasons to suppose that PAR might be formed according to the I/E model, yet the evidence so far is unclear because of the types of other ratings and the different methodologies that were used in earlier studies.",

To do so, we tested a model with PAR as the predictor and academic self-concept as the outcome. Second, we also aimed to understand PAR's formation in terms of the I/E model. To achieve this second aim, we compared I/E models predicting self-concept in math and English with I/E models predicting PAR in math and English (with objective measures of achievement as predictors in all models). For selfconcept, we expected to find positive effects within domains and negative effects across domains, in line with the I/E model.

In earlier observational studies, only single perceivers were asked to rate each target student. To avoid this issue, we focused our investigation on PAR, which was assessed in a round-robin design where students rated every classmate (see Fig. 2 for an example). Furthermore, we used a large sample of 850 school students and achievement measures consisting of school grades and standardized achievement tests. To corroborate our results, we replicated the analyses for all four waves that were measured in this sample.",

We focused our analyses on classes in which round-robin data were collected. These were exclusively classes from the nonacademic track (Mittelschule) in the state of Saxony. For the main part of the analyses, we used data from the third wave of measurement in 2010 when students were in the seventh grade. Earlier studies have shown that older (and also better acquainted) students' peer ratings of achievement are more differentiated and more accurate than the peer ratings of younger (and less closely acquainted) students (Malloy, Sugarman, Montvilo, & Ben-Zeev, 1995; Malloy, Yarlas, Montvilo, & Sugarman, 1996) . Thus, we chose the measurement wave in which students had known each other for somewhat more than 2 years to ensure a reliable and valid measurement of PAR. To check whether our results would replicate in the other measurement waves, we also conducted analyses for the Grade 5, 6, and 8 samples by applying the same analytical approach. See Supplement 1 for a description of sample characteristics as well as further notes on the methods used in these grades. L\u20ac osch et al.

However, to investigate the I/E model, we needed to model achievement ratings in two domains simultaneously. Thus, we drew on the bivariate extension of the SRM (Kenny, 1994) . Typically, the SRM is applied in a round-robin design (Kenny, 1994) . Variance in ratings is attributed to individual differences stemming from three sources. The perceiver effect describes a tendency to rate peers as competent (e.g., How competent does Alex think his classmates are in math?). The target effect describes a tendency to be rated as competent (e.g., How competent do Alex' classmates think he is in math?). Finally, the relationship effect describes the unique tendency of one student to rate one other student and cannot be separated from measurement error (e.g., How competent does Alex think that Beth in particular is in math?).

That is, in the estimation of the SRM, we specified a background model in which we included grades, achievement tests, and academic self-concept in both domains as predictors of the target effect in both domains. For further statistical analyses, we then drew 50 plausible values (see Asparouhov & Muth en, 2010) from the posterior distribution of the target effect (see Bodner, 2008) . Finally, we aggregated statistical estimates across these 50 imputations using Rubin's rule (Rubin, 1987) via the R package miceadds for the correlations (Robitzsch, 2015) and via procedures to handle multiple imputations implemented in Mplus 7.1 for the I/E models (Muthen & Muthen, 2012) .

A negative regression coefficient across domains (e.g., English self-concept on math achievement) indicates dimensional comparison effects. In the basic model, we used grades and standardized tests as achievement measures. We adapted this basic specification and additionally used the target effect (as a measure of PAR) first as a predictor and then as an outcome. Altogether, we specified five I/E models: two basic models with self-concept as the outcome and either grades or achievement test as the predictor, one model with the target effect as the predictor and academic self-concept as the outcome, and two models with the target effect as the outcome and either grades or achievement test as the predictor. We specified self-concept as measured by the self-concept items. We controlled for unreliability in achievement test scores by specifying them as measured with a single indicator and constrained their residual variance to their sampling variance multiplied with 1 -their reliability (0.44 in math and 4.33 in English). The I/E models were estimated in Mplus 7.1 (Muthen & Muthen, 2012) . We adjusted the standard errors to account for the clustered data structure (i.e., students clustered in classes).

Both the students themselves and their peers were relatively accurate, but the correlations differed significantly. That is, the correlations between PAR and achievement were significantly stronger than the correlations between self-concept and achievement in math (standardized test: t \u00bc 4.15, p < .001; grades: t \u00bc 14.71, p < .001) as well as English (standardized test: t \u00bc 4.99, p < .001; grades: t \u00bc 10.5, p < .001). Furthermore, self-concept and PAR were correlated as well (e.g., r \u00bc .40 in math). This result indicates that students had a moderate to high level of self-other agreement with their peers. Across domains, the correlations between the same constructs measured in math and English showed an interesting pattern. Achievement measures across domains had a moderate to high correlation, for instance, the correlation between grades in math and English was r \u00bc .57. As is usually found, the correlation between self-concepts in math and English was substantially lower (r \u00bc .17).

In the framework of the I/E model, we sought to understand PAR as a predictor of academic self-concept and as an outcome of dimensional comparisons. By reanalyzing data from a large-scale school achievement study, first, we tested PAR as a predictor of academic self-concept in the I/E model; and second, we tested PAR as an outcome with achievement as the predictor in the I/E model. We compared both conceptualizations with the more common I/E model in math and English with achievement as a predictor of academic self-concept. To overcome the issues found in earlier studies, we measured PAR in a round-robin design in which students rated each of their classmates. Our results supported the I/ E model with self-concept as the outcome when grades were used as the achievement measure but not when tests were used as the achievement measure (see Limitations below). That is, grades in one domain (e.g., English) had a positive effect on self-concept in the corresponding domain (e.g., English) but a negative effect on self-concept in the noncorresponding domain (e.g., math). We found the same pattern when PAR was used as the predictor of academic self-concept. However, the I/E model was not supported when PAR was the outcome. Achievement in one domain had a positive effect on PAR in the corresponding domain, but it also had a positive effect on PAR in the noncorresponding domain.",

Prior studies that found positive effects across domains explained them as a result of the (perceived) similarity of domains (e.g., M\u20ac oller, Streblow, & Pohlmann, 2006) . If features of domains were the only explanation for dimensional comparisons effects, this would imply that in other perception, the domains would be perceived differently than in self-perceptiondwhich may be rather unlikely. Otherwise, students might not be able to differentiate their classmates' achievements across multiple domains. For instance, they might not be equally acquainted with all of their peers, and accordingly, they would need to rely on heuristics to rate the achievement of the peers they do not know well. Such a heuristic might consist of using a general impression of competence. If this was the case, acquaintance could be a moderator of cross-domain effects. That is, a negative cross-domain effect for PAR might be present only for well-acquainted students. Finally, students might not be motivated to rate their peers in differentiated ways. That is, as M\u20ac oller and Marsh (2013) argued, motives such as self-enhancement or selfverification (cf. Leary, 2007) would drive students to internally compare their achievement. Regarding their classmates, students might not be interested in acquiring a similarly differentiated perception.

This result is puzzling as the I/E model was previously found to hold for both standardized tests and grades (M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) , and we can only speculate about explanations. On the one hand, the achievement tests might not have elicited negative cross-domain effects because they were not salient to students or because the tests were low-stakes tests. However, as the tests were based on the students' curriculum, achievement in the tests should be relatively salient to them. Furthermore, earlier studies found negative cross-domain effects with low-stakes tests as well (e.g., Jansen et al., 2015) . Regarding the domains, students might not perceive English (as a foreign language) as a verbal domain, and this may have led to the absence of dimensional comparison effects. Contradicting this explanation is the fact that we found negative cross-domain effects when grades and PAR were used as predictors. Finally, the absence of a negative effect for tests might be related to student characteristics, especially their age. In a recent study, the I/E model was not supported for elementary school children (Lohbeck & M\u20ac oller, 2017) . M\u20ac oller (2005) observed a similar result and argued that dimensional comparisons require a certain level of cognitive maturity. However, students in our sample were in Grades 5 to 8 and were thus out of elementary school (which ends in Grade 4 in Germany), which rather precludes cognitive maturity as an explanation. Overall, it is likely that a combination of these factors led to the observed results, and further research is required to identify moderators of dimensional comparison effects.",

Peer ratings of achievement were collected in a grid structure with classmates ordered in rows and achievement ratings in columns. Furthermore, the item format was confounded with the outcome: Academic self-concept was measured in a traditional format, whereas PAR was measured within the grid. This item format may have evoked or diminished frame of reference effects, and thus, it might have biased the correlation of PAR in math and English. However, Sparfeldt, Schilling, Rost, and Thiel (2006) tested the effect of the grid format on the dimensional structure of academic self-concept. They found that the grid was equivalent to a more traditional item format, and they furthermore found the I/E model for academic self-concept measured in the grid structure as well. Accordingly, we would argue that it is unlikely that basing the measurement of PAR on a grid structure biased our results. This argument is further supported by the similarity of our results with the results of Pohlmann et al. (2004) and , who assessed inferred self-concepts in a traditional questionnaire design and who also did not find negative cross-domain effects.",

In the federal state of Saxony (where the data were collected), there are two school tracks, and our sample comprised students from the lower track. These students were lower achieving and might have also been less motivated. This might affect the generalizability of our results and might have led to the lower reliability and validity of our measures, especially considering that providing peer ratings of achievement might have been arduous. That being said, results from the SRM models (see Table S1 in the supplement) indicated a sufficient amount of variation in ratings to allow for a useful interpretation of PAR (see Kenny, 1994) . Nevertheless, with regard to PAR, there is a need for more studies in diverse samples to shed more light on the generalizability of results.",

In this study, we sought to understand the role of peer perception in the I/E model as a specific test of dimensional comparison theory (M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013; M\u20ac oller et al., 2015) . In I/E models in the domains of math and English, we found negative cross-domain effects when PAR was used to predict academic self-concept, but we found positive cross-domain effects when achievement was used to predict PAR. Because of these results, it seems that peer perception elicits dimensional contrasts in the self-perception of achievement, but conversely, peer perception of achievement seems to be marked by dimensional assimilation.",
