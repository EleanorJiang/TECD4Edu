    "abstract": "In this study, predictive relations were examined between math and verbal achievement and several different measures of motivation. The sample consisted of 348 sixth grade and 325 ninth grade Norwegian students. Motivation variables of self concept, self-perceived aptitude, and self-perceived ability to learn within each domain were highly correlated and used as indicators to define math and verbal latent variables labeled general math and verbal self-perceptions. Subscales measuring self-perceived math and verbal skills were used to define another set of math and verbal latent variables labeled specific math and verbal self-perceptions. Both general and specific math and verbal self-perceptions were strongly related to corresponding achievement. Predictions from Marsh's internal/external frame of reference model were confirmed for math and verbal general self-perceptions but not for specific self-perceptions. General self-perceptions strongly affected intrinsic motivation, self-perceived effort, and anxiety in the respective domains, whereas specific self-perceptions did not. The pattern of results was quite similar for the two grade levels.",

The I/E model was developed to explain an unexpected lack of correlation between math and verbal selfconcepts. It offers a challenging new perspective on development of academic self-concept and motivational processes in school. However, even though the model is supported by several studies (see Skaalvik & Rankin, 1992) , few studies have examined the generalizability of the model across different measures of academic self-perception. Such studies are needed to determine the ability of the I/E model to explain development of self-perception in school. Also, as pointed out by Marsh, Walker, and Debus (199D there is a need to test whether the frames of reference proposed in the I/E model are useful in predicting behavior. This study tested the I/E model for math and verbal self-concept at different levels of generality and for implications of the model for students' motivational, emotional, and behavioral responses.",

Self-efficacy is concerned with judgments of how well one can execute courses of actions required to deal with prospective situations (Bandura, 1982) . Following Bandura (1986) , self-efficacy differs from self-concept in that it is concerned not with the skills and abilities one thinks one has but with judgments of what one can do with whatever skills one possesses. Self-efficacy is typically measured by deriving responses to specific tasks in particular subdomains (Marsh, Walker, & Debus, 1991) . Math self-efficacy, for instance, is often measured by presenting math questions or problems to the students and asking them to indicate how certain they are that they can solve similar types of problems (Bandura & Schunk, 1981) . However, this distinction is not inherent in self-concept and self-efficacy research (see Marsh, 1990c) . Self-concept can be assessed at a low level of generality (e.g., self-concept of ability to calculate percentage). Such measures have not been explored previously in self-concept research. Accordingly, this study explores selfperceived math and verbal skills and their relations to self-concept measures at higher levels of generality.",

Internal comparisons, according to Marsh (1986) , predict a negative correlation between math and verbal self-concept, because math and verbal skills are compared with each other, and it is the difference between them that contributes to higher self-concept in one of the domains. Thus, according to Marsh, Walker, and Debus (199D, better math skills lead to a better math self-concept but a poorer verbal self-concept, whereas better verbal skills lead to a better verbal self-concept but a poorer math selfconcept. The joint effect of external and internal comparisons is assumed to balance out the effect of each process, resulting in a near zero correlation between math and verbal self-concept. Thus, according to Marsh (1986) , the I/E model predicts both: (a) a near-zero correlation between math and verbal self-concept and (b) negative direct effects of math achievement on verbal self-concept and negative direct effects of verbal achievement on math selfconcept. These predictions are supported in several studies measuring math and verbal self-concepts at a high level of generality (Byrne & Shavelson, 1987; Marsh, 1986; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988; Marsh, Walker, & Debus, 1991) .",

Students use the performances of classmates and their own performance in other domains (external and internal comparisons) to establish frames of reference for self-evaluation (Marsh, Walker, & Debus, 1991) . However, both external and internal comparisons may be more important for development of self-concept at a high level of generality (e.g., general feeling of doing well in math) than for self-perceived skills. The general feeling of doing well in math is affected by both previous experiences of being able to do assigned tasks and by comparisons of one's own achievements with those of others and with one's own achievement in other areas. In comparison, self-perceived skills are judgments of one's ability to do particular types of tasks. The focus is on what one can do and not on evaluations of how good that is. Such judgments are assumed to depend primarily on prior mastery experiences with similar types of tasks, and they should be relatively independent of perceptions of what others are able to do or what one can do in other domains (Skaalvik & Rankin, in press ). The questions a person asks himself or herself are different at different levels of generality. At high levels of generality, the judgments concerning math, for instance, involve questions like: How well do I do in math? How good am I in math? and How well can I learn math? In comparison, at a low level of generality, self-perceived skills involve questions like: Can I do the task? and Can I solve this math problem? Based on these differences between self-concept at high and low levels of generality, the predictions from the I/E model are expected to be confirmed when measuring math and verbal self-concepts, self-perceived aptitudes, and self-perceived abilities to learn but not when measuring self-perceived math and verbal skills.",

It further assumes that individuals are motivated to evaluate themselves favorably and that students are motivated to protect and enhance their sense of worth (Covington, 1984; Rosenberg, 1979) . When children's ability perceptions are threatened in school, they may develop self-protective strategies. Rosenberg proposes that people may devalue situations and activities that are threatening to the self. Covington proposes that another defense may be not to try hard, because the combination of high effort and failure leads to suspicions of low ability. Self-worth theory therefore implies that failure expectations will affect intrinsic motivation, effort, and anxiety. Rankin and I assume that failure expectations and affective consequences are largely domain specific and that ability perceptions may be particularly threatened by expectations to fail relative to one's comparison group. We therefore predict that students' domain-specific selfperceptions (e.g., math self-concept, self-perceived aptitudes, and self-perceived ability to learn), which are assumed to be based on external and internal comparisons, affect intrinsic motivation, effort, and anxiety and are affected by academic achievement.

LISREL proceeds by testing the fit between a sample covariance matrix and a matrix reproduced when parameters are constrained to match a theoretical model. Latent traits are represented by circles, with paths from independent to dependent variables represented by single-headed arrows. Paths represent the standardized coefficients between variables that would occur if each subject had the same score on all the other variables. The fit index (GFI) is the percent of variance in the sample covariance matrix explained by the matrix reproduced from the model. The first step in the analysis was to test the correlations among SDQ, SPA, and SAL. These correlations were tested by four analyses, two at each grade level, with the grade level separated into math and verbal analyses. The 10 items of the SDQ, the 3 items of the SPA, and the 3 items of the SAL were entered into analyses at the item level. A simple covariance structural analysis (LISREL) revealed that the three constructs were highly correlated in both Grade 6 and Grade 9 with the disattenuated coefficients reported in Table 3 . The solutions converged quickly, and there were no problems or warnings. This latter analysis led to the decision to identify two single-domain specific traits at a high level of generality, math general self-perception (hereafter referred to as MGSP) and verbal self-perception (hereafter referred to as VGSP), underlying SDQ, SPA, and SAL, and to use these latent traits in the subsequent models.",

Hence, the predictions from the I/E model were expected to be confirmed when measuring math and verbal self-concepts, self-perceived aptitudes, and self-perceived abilities to learn, but not when measuring selfperceived math and verbal skills.

Thus, when assessed at the same level of generality, our results suggest that these scales are measuring the same constructive motivation construct. A possible interpretation is that judgments of one's aptitude or ability to learn in a domain are based on general feelings of doing well or poorly in that domain. These judgments therefore resemble domain specific self-concept judgments, assumed to be based on social and internal comparisons, as well as evaluations offered by significant others. No doubt, there is a logical difference between self-concept and self-perceived ability to learn. For instance, individuals may perceive themselves as not being good at, or even able to play the violin, but they may still believe that they have the capability of learning it. However, this distinction may be less relevant for math and verbal self-perceptions in school, because all students are exposed to these activities. Hence, their math and verbal achievements in school may be perceived as a result of their capability for learning in these areas.",

In this study, the model was supported using two Norwegian samples and combining measures of self-concept, self-perceived aptitude, and self-perceived ability to learn into single math and verbal latent traits.

Also, math and verbal specific self-perceptions were strongly correlated.

These findings are consistent with those of a previous study by Norwich (1987) that also measured self-concept at a high level of generality and measured self-efficacy at a low level of generality. Norwich's results showed that academic achievement had a strong indirect effect on motivation through general self-perceptions. Our analysis also demonstrated strong and positive indirect effects of achievement in one domain on intrinsic motivation, effort, and anxiety in the same domain and smaller negative indirect effects of achievement in one domain on intrinsic motivation, effort, and anxiety in the other domain. These results illustrate implications of the I/E model not previously explored. In accordance with the results discussed above-that the I/E model was supported for general but not for specific self-perceptions-the indirect effects of achievement on intrinsic motivation, effort, and anxiety were mediated by general self-perceptions. Bandura (1977 Bandura ( , 1986 postulates that self-efficacy expectations predict effort and persistence in the face of difficulties. The same prediction could be made for self-perceived skills. However, one possible reason for the lack of association between self-perceived skills and intrinsic motivation or effort in this study is that high achieving students, who also tend to have high selfperceived skills, often receive insufficient challenge in school. Thus, they do not need maximal effort to manage the tasks. Under such conditions, the pure expectation of being able to perform the task (self-perceived skills) may not be a good predictor of intrinsic motivation or high effort.",

Thus, the level of generality in the assessments of intrinsic motivation, effort, and anxiety more closely corresponded with the measures of general self-perceptions than with the measures of self-perceived skills. The possibility should not be ruled out that students' motivation to work with specific tasks is affected by their judgment of being able to do those tasks. The distinction between levels of generality may have important practical implications as part of the school day is spent practicing previous knowledge and skills. But schoolwork also has to do with learning new tasks, and with anticipations of one's abilities for learning new tasks. Our results suggest that these anticipations affect students' intrinsic motivation for mathematics in general and their general math anxiety. An important task for future research is to examine predictive values of self-perceptions measured at different levels of generality for both general intrinsic math and verbal motivation and for motivation for working with concrete problems. Such studies should also include behavioral measures of motivation.",

One hypothesis that may be derived from this study is that it is not the expectations of being able to do certain tasks that affect general intrinsic motivation and anxiety but the performance expectations relative to some standard-for example, perception of what others can do.

Self-perceived ability to learn in math and verbal domains is also conceptually related to math and verbal learning self-efficacy. If self-efficacy is viewed as a latent trait concerned with judgments of what one can do with whatever skills and aptitudes one has, and not considered to be scale specific, then a final hypothesis based on our data is that the I/E model would not apply to specific measures of math and verbal self-efficacy as typically measured; however, it might apply to measures of learning self-efficacy.
