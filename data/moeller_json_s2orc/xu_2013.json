In this respect, the formation of ASC is likely to be a function of the students' relative ranking in their school or classroom. Higher achievement relative to others leads to higher ASC. This process is presented as the horizontal paths in the I/E model (see Figure 2A ). For the internal comparison process, students use information from achievements in all their school subjects in forming their ASC in each subject. For example, if verbal achievement is higher than math achievement, verbal ASC is likely to be higher than math ASC. In the I/E model, these predictions are represented by the negative cross paths (see Figure 2A ). Hence, after controlling for the paths from achievement to ASC in the matching domains, verbal achievement is negatively predicted math ASC, and vice versa. Within this pattern of internal comparisons, a student who has higher math achievement compared to his or her verbal achievement may have a reasonable math ASC even if the student is weak in both math and verbal domains in comparison to other students. The combination of the external comparison process (predicting positive associations between achievements and matching ASCs) and internal comparison process (predicting negative associations between achievements and nonmatching ASCs) is consistent with the near-zero correlation between math and verbal self-concepts.",

                "text": "Less studied is whether the I/E model also holds for ASCs that are closer together on the continuum (e.g., math vs. physics; native vs. native languages). Following logically from the theoretical rationale for the I/E model, coupled with the Marsh/Shavelson (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) model and the continuum of ASCs (e.g., Figures 1A & 1B) , we predict that the contrast effect will be stronger, the further apart the two domains are on the ASC continuum. That is, the negative effect of achievement in one domain will be more negative for domains that are further apart. This leaves open the intriguing possibility that there might be assimilation for domains that are closer together on the continuum. That is, for closely related domains, the effect of achievement in one domain on ASC in a different domain might be positive (assimilation) rather than negative (contrast). Making a similar point as a direction for further research, M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, Koller & Marsh (2009) asked, Would students see physics and mathematics as sufficiently distinct that better performances in one would lead to poorer self-concepts in the other (a contrast effect like that posited in the I/E model based on the math and verbal domains), or would the two be seen as sufficiently similar so that better performance in one would lead to better selfconcepts in the other (an assimilation effect)? Although clearly beyond the scope of the present investigation, this is a potentially important extension of the I/E model. (p. 1159) Although this is apparently a new extension of the classic I/E model (but see Marsh & Yeung, 2001; M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & K\u00f6ller, 2006) , there is some empirical support for it.",

Consistently with classical I/E predictions, they found the expected negative paths from contrasting domains (German and English achievements to math and physics ASCs; math and physics achievements to German and English ASCs). However, there was assimilation for math and physics-small positive effects from physics achievement to math ASC and from math achievement to physics ASC. Although the paths from English to German and German to English were all consistently small, they clearly did not support the strong contrast effects predicted by the classic I/E model. suggested that students apparently perceive native and foreign languages as being more distinct than math and science and suggested that this might be due to different teaching strategies in native and nonnative languages that accentuate their distinctiveness.",

Based on five achievement test scores they posited three achievement factors (verbal, math, and Spanish) that were related to six ASCs (global verbal, English, Spanish, history, global math, algebra, geometry, and chemistry). Analyses based only on the global verbal and math ASCs and on corresponding achievement scores showed clear support for classic I/E predictions. When expanded to include all the achievement and ASC scores, Spanish was distinct from the other domains in relation to both achievement and ASC. Verbal achievement had positive effects on English, history, and global verbal ASCs, but negative effects on Spanish, algebra, geometry, and chemistry ASCs, while math achievement had negative effects on English, history, verbal, and Spanish ASCs but positive effects on algebra, geometry, global math, and chemistry ASCs. Spanish achievement had small negative effects on all ASC scales other than Spanish ASC. Although this is largely consistent with our proposed extension of the I/E model, the results suggest that Spanish in this study was quite distinct from domains near the verbal end of the continuum as well as from the math end of the continuum. In this study, Spanish, the native language for many participants, was found to negatively predict competence evaluation in other school subjects. However, given that Spanish was the native language for nearly half of the students and a foreign language for the other half, the results may have been idiosyncratic to this sample. Further, the sample size was not sufficient to test the generalizability of results across different ethnic groups.",

In a large longitudinal study of Hong Kong high school students (Grade 6 to Grade 10), ASCs and achievement in three domains (math, Chinese, English) showed contrast effects: negative paths from achievement scores to nonmatching ASC in all domains (see alsoYeung, Lee, & Wong, 2001 ). However, even though there were negative effects of English achievement on Chinese ASC and of Chinese achievement on English ASC, the effects of Chinese achievement on English ASC were smaller (or nonsignificant) than paths relating Chinese or English achievement to math ASC. This indicates a much weaker internal frame of reference effect from Chinese achievement to English ASC. Furthermore, based on a sample of university students, Yeung and Lau (1998) found that support for the I/E model predicted contrast effects for relations between the English (nonnative language) and math domains but not for relations between the Chinese (native This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.",

However, a limitation of this study was that they did not juxtapose the three school subjects in one model; rather, they tested the traditional I/E model based on two domains at a time. In summary, for academic domains at opposite ends of the ASC continuum, I/E research consistently shows support for classic I/E predictions-contrasting, negative effects of achievement on ASCs in nonmatching, distinct domains. Nevertheless, for domains closer together (e.g., math and science, or native and nonnative language), the results are mixed, and marked by much weaker contrast effects, no significant effects, or even assimilation effects between achievement and ASC in nonmatching domains.",

A related issue is the language of instruction (LOI). In Hong Kong, the juxtaposition of English-LOI versus Chinese-LOI is a critical issue with important substantive and policy-practice implications. Hong Kong has a long history of bilingual education (Evans, 2011) , with both English and Chinese LOIs in Hong Kong secondary schools (Grades 7 to 12). The LOI policy in Hong Kong is a type of late immersion, where the LOI changes from Chinese in most primary schools to English in about a quarter of the more prestigious secondary schools (Marsh, Hau, & Kong, 2000) . On the one hand, the study of secondary school students found some support for the classic I/E model contrast predictions among English and Chinese subjects. On the other hand, the English language is qualitatively very different from the Chinese language, so a dimensional comparison aspect could still exist between English and Chinese, particularly when English is taught as a separate subject in Chinese LOI schools. Conversely, English and Chinese might be seen as complementary domains when Chinese students are immersed in English LOI schools.",

If so, English LOI students might regard the combination of English and Chinese as a single basis of comparison for evaluating their ASCs in other, more distinct subjects such as math. Do students attending English LOI schools perceive their English and Chinese competence and ASCs similarly to the students attending Chinese LOI schools? Are the processes posited in the I/E model, relating achievement and ASC (in this extension including English and Chinese as well as mathematics) similar for students in LOI-English and LOI-Chinese schools?

The model generates the seemingly paradoxical prediction that high achievement in one school subject will have a negative effect on ASC in a contrasting domain. However, the considerable body of support for this prediction has been limited primarily to the math domain and the verbal domain represented by the native language-two school subjects that are maximally differentiated along the math-verbal continuum posited in the Marsh/Shavelson (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) model of self-concept. Hence, the purpose of the present investigation is to extend the empirical and theoretical basis of the well-established I/E model based on math and verbal constructs and include LOI that involves a nonnative language. The overarching research question is whether the nonnative LOI acts as a verbal-like school subject such that achievement in this subject is contrasted with math achievement but not achievement in the native language or whether it is contrasted with achievements in both math and native language.",

However, the relationship between nonmatching domains in the English-Chinese (\u03ea0.17, \u03ea0.15) I/E model was somewhat weaker compared to the relationship found in the English-math (\u03ea0.30, \u03ea.27) and the Chinese-math (\u03ea0.34, \u03ea0.22) models. The weak cross paths and high correlations between Chinese and English ASCs suggest a weak internal comparison mechanism with regard to self-perceived abilities in English and Chinese.

Model TG4 was well-defined, in that all factor loadings were substantial and the fit indices were excellent (e.g., CFI \u03ed 0.993). There were high positive correlations between the math and English achievements (0.65), math and Chinese achievement (0.63), and English and Chinese achievement (0.72) but substantially smaller correlations between ASCs in these subjects (0.32 for math and English, 0.36 for Chinese and math and 0.50 for English and Chinese). The paths from math achievement to math ASC (0.66), from English achievement to English ASC (0.63), and from Chinese achievement to Chinese ASC (0.36) were all significant and positive. Although differing in size, all of the cross paths were negative. The paths from math achievement to English ASC (\u03ea0.25) and from math achievement to Chinese ASC (\u03ea0.19) were both significant and negative, controlling for the effects of matching domain achievements on ASCs. English achievement negatively predicted math ASC (\u03ea0.16), but its negative effect on Chinese ASC (\u03ea0.08) was not statistically significant. Similarly, for Chinese achievement, the path leading from Chinese achievement to math ASC (\u03ea0.26) was negative and significant, but the negative effect of Chinese achievement on English ASC was not statistically significant (\u03ea0.08). This shows that the I/E pattern of relations involving English and Chinese was no longer statistically significant once all three subjects were posited simultaneously in one model. In summary, math achievement negatively predicted both English and Chinese ASCs, and Chinese achievement and English achievement both negatively predicted math ASC. However, the paths leading from English achievement to Chinese ASC and from Chinese achievement to English ASC were not statistically significant. In the next step, we combine achievement and ASCs in English and Chinese into higher order factors, in order to implement an alternative test of the I/E model.",

This implies that the internal frame of reference does not apply to English and Chinese subjects. If a student performs well in English, this student's Chinese ASC will not be affected adversely. Similarly for a student excelling in Chinese, English ASC will not suffer, as would be the case for very distinct domains such as math and English/Chinese. This led to the development of the higher order I/E model (Model TG5), where English and Chinese ASCs were combined into a higher order ASC. The higher order I/E model supported the typical two domain (math and verbal) I/E model. The contrast effect was confirmed by the dimensional comparison process shown by the negative cross paths from math and verbal crossdomain achievement to ASC. The present study's results are in agreement with findings from the German study (M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & K\u00f6ller, 2006) . These authors found almost no effect from English (German) achievement to German (English) ASC, even though an earlier Hong Kong study reported small negative cross paths between English and Chinese at the beginning of high school. Nevertheless, based on our findings, the unique contribution of the present investigation was to combine a native language subject with a foreign language subject; this extension demonstrated support for the originally proposed I/E model theory.",

The measurement invariance properties of the ASCs indicate that students from English-or Chinese-LOI schools perceived ASCs similarly and support the validity for the comparison of I/E models across LOI groups. The English-LOI students apparently shared a similar frame of reference process, both in terms of the external, social comparison process and the internal, dimensional comparison process.

Whether bilingualism is beneficial or not therefore depends substantially on how competent the students are in the language of instruction. Concomitantly, it is self-evidently much easier for students to understand course content in their native language, and this better enables them to retain their learning motivation and preserve the quality of their teaching and learning activity. The same is true for teachers. Since English is also a second language to the teachers (Llewellyn, Hancock, Kirst, & Roeloffs, 1982) , teachers in English-LOI classrooms tend to rely more on didactic approaches to teaching and are less effective in communicating abstract concepts to the students (Yip, Coyle, & Tsang, 2007) . Indeed, students in nonnative-LOI classrooms tend to have lower engagement in classroom activities, to use fewer learning strategies (Salili & Lai, 2003) , and to experience slower development in non-languagerelated outcomes (Marsh et al., 2000 (Marsh et al., , 2002 ; see also Halle, Hair, Wandner, McNamara, & Chien, 2012) . These difficulties are disadvantageous to the development of the students' learning and motivations to learn. Intervention programs designed to enhance both teaching and learning should also target ASCs, since these are reciprocally linked with academic achievement (Marsh & Yeung, 1997) .",

Based on the premise that the ASC facilitates many future academic accomplishments, aspirations, and choices (Marsh, 1991 (Marsh, , 2007 , maintaining a positive ASC is clearly crucial in helping students to reach their academic potential, and this has been shown to generalize both in English and Chinese LOI students (Marsh et al., 2002) . This, however, would also require teachers and parents to understand more deeply how such process might be best supported. Nevertheless, when asked about the perceived domain-specific academic competencies of the students, teachers (Marsh & Craven, 1997) and parents (Dai, 2002) indicated that their perceptions of students' competency in different domains were based primarily on external processes of evaluation and did not differentiate between domains nearly as much as students did themselves. In other words, it appears that a student who is good in math would also be perceived by parents and teachers as being good at verbal subjects, and vice versa. This indicates a difference in the views that the parents and teachers take in terms of the internal frame of reference aspect of students' ASCs posited in the I/E model theory. When students show reduced effort or interest in learning in their weak subjects, teachers and parents need to intervene in order to facilitate students' learning: both by enhancing their academic ability and by restoring their ASC in their weaker domains. Similarly, it would be helpful for curriculum developers to build strong connections between different school subjects, to promote the cultivation of students' confidence and interest in learning all their academic subjects, instead of just their best ones. Based on our finding that the I/E model is generalizable to both English and Chinese LOI students, this practice would be applicable to the students under both LOIs.",

However, this sampling composition is in agreement with the actual Hong Kong secondary school population in terms of LOI. In Hong Kong, in order for a school to adopt English-LOI practice, the students' academic ability needs to reach certain level in order for the English-LOI practice to be effective. Nevertheless, studies that can replicate our results based on samples with completely balanced ability compositions will certainly provide further robustness to our findings. Another feature of the sample that is worth noting in our study is that the ASC measures were collected approximately 1 year after the students started their secondary school. It is possible that changes in the processes related to the I/E model could take place depending on the duration of the immersion. Longitudinal studies that investigate the effect of LOI at different time points after students are immersed in new LOI environments will shed light on the processes that the effect of LOI takes place.",

The regression coefficient relating Chinese achievement to Chinese ASC was smaller than the corresponding value in the English and math domains. Since Chinese, as the native language of Hong Kong, is used pervasively outside of school, it is likely that Chinese ASC is more broadly based, while math and English ASC are based primarily on achievement tests and performance in classroom settings. Certainly, students use Chinese language more frequently and on more diverse occasions compared to the utility of English and math. The metaanalysis also showed that verbal achievement in native language predicted verbal ASC to a lesser extent compared to predictions from math achievement to math ASC. A study (Marsh, 1990) of Australian students showed that different components of English (native language) ASCs were only moderately correlated, this indicates that the English ASC itself might be able to be further divided. Hence, further in-depth information might be revealed if more domain specific assessments were implemented in Chinese ASC instruments, alongside the corresponding specific Chinese achievement measures.",

Whether this would hold true for other verbal domain subjects is beyond the scope of the present investigation. However, it would be interesting to test whether other domains classified as verbal-based subjects, as posited by Marsh and Shavelson (1985;  Figure 1B ), such as history or foreign languages other than English, belong to the same factor as English and Chinese. Future studies could explore this by collecting data in a multilingual context such as Singapore, where many languages coexist in society. Similarly it might be reasonable, for example, that math and physics combine to form a single frame of reference. Extending this logic, it is still not clear whether two contrasting frames of reference (math vs. verbal) would be able to incorporate all school subjects (e.g., history, geography, computer studies, but also art, physical education, industrial arts and home economics).",

Items pertaining to affect assess the level of interests and enjoyment the students have for a particular subject, whereas items pertaining to competency ask questions about whether they are competent and get good marks in a subject. Even though the correlations between competency and affect can be as high as 0.75 (e.g., Marsh, Craven, & Debus, (1999) , the relationship between different components of ASC might be differentially correlated with other variables. For example, in a recent study based on a sample of German students from third to sixth grades (Arens, Yeung, Craven, & Hasselhorn, 2011) , the competency component of the ASC was found to be more closely related with the achievement than the affect component. Since LOI has been shown to affect learning motivations (Salili & Lai, 2003) , it is important to examine the applicability of the I/E model to these more specific components of ASC. To achieve this, the study design would involve assessing both competency and affect from different LOI students, on multiple school subjects and using multiple indicators for both components.",

It is possible that the internal and external comparison processes generalize across different psychological constructs such as those posited in the Student Approaches to Learning instrument (SAL; Marsh, Hau, Artelt, Baumert, & Peschar, 2006) . Generalizability of the I/E model will be relevant to the concept of domain specificity, that is, how closely the constructs are correlated across different subject domains. If the construct's correlations across district domains are as low as ASC, then this construct is of high domain specificity, and it is likely that the frame of reference effect is present in the formation of this construct. Conversely, if a construct is of low domain specificity then the I/E model may be less or only partly applicable to this construct. Studies that examine domain specific-ity and the generalizability of the I/E models to a wider range of psychosocial variables will provide valuable contribution to the understanding of the development of the students' learning and motivation.",
