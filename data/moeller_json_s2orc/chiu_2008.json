                "text": "Educators of math and science have long researched self-concepts for their respective subjects. Research results reveal a consistent relationship between student math and science self-concepts and their corresponding achievements (e.g., Hannula, 2002; Lee & Brophy, 1996; Pietsch, Walker, & Chapman, 2003; Tuan, Chin, & Shieh, 2005; Whitebread & Chiu, 2004) . These two lines of research, however, fail to make reference to each other across subjects. The aims of both science and math education in constructivist curricula emphasize the links between different subjects of knowledge in order to enable students to deepen their understanding of knowledge and cultivate their abilities to apply knowledge in real life (e.g., Department for Children, Schools, and Families in the UK, 2008; Ministry of Education in Taiwan, 2007) . Students are very likely to link their math and science skills, as they are complementary in nature, and then to form their math and science self-concepts. The detailed cross-subject effects of achievements on self-concepts are still unknown for math and science. Marsh's (1986) Internal/External Frame of Reference (I/E) model proposes a clear theoretical framework to predict the effects of achievements on self-concepts across subjects. In addition, Marsh and Hau (2004) have successfully generalized the I/E model across 26 countries by analyzing the data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) study of 2000. Their study, however, focused on math and verbal skills, which are more likely to be regarded as two distinct or extremely different school subjects than is the case with math and science. The present investigation will analyze the data from the Trends in International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) of 2003, compiled by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA, 2005) to analyze the effects of achievements on self-concepts in a comparison of math and science across 28 countries. In other words, the aim of the present study is to examine the ''generalizability'' (Van de Vijver & Leung, 2000, p. 39) of the I/E model to math and science across cultures.",

The structure comprises a general self-concept on a higher level that incorporates within it two aspects at a lower level: a non-academic selfconcept and an academic one; for instance, ''I'm a popular person'' is a non-academic selfconcept and ''I'm good at science'' is an academic self-concept for a subject. Then the next lower level of non-academic self-concepts may include social, emotional, and physical selfconcepts and that of academic self-concepts may include English, math, and science selfconcepts. The hierarchy can be further extended to the next lower level; for example, emotional self-concept may comprise self-concepts of emotional awareness and emotional control. A variety of studies generally support a multidimensional perspective of selfconcept instead of a unidimensional one (e.g., Cheng & Watkins, 2000; Hagger, Asci, & Lindwall, 2004; O'Mara, Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 2006; Tam & Watkins, 1995) . In addition, there are consistently stronger relations between domain-specific achievements and self-concepts than between global academic achievements and self-concepts Marsh, Trautwein, Lu\u00a8dtke, Ko\u00a8ller, & Baumert, 2006) .",

The I/E model was developed with the intention to explain the high correlations between math and verbal achievements but low or close to zero correlations between math and verbal self-concepts (Marsh, 1986 (Marsh, , 1989 (Marsh, , 1990 (Marsh, , 1993 . The theory posits a paradoxical pattern of relations between math and verbal self-concepts and math and verbal achievements: (1) Based on external/social comparison, a high math achievement contributes to a positive math self-concept, and a high verbal achievement contributes to a positive verbal self-concept. (2) Based on internal comparison, a high math achievement contributes to a negative verbal self-concept, and a high verbal achievement contributes to a negative math concept (cf. Diagram A in Figure 1 ). Students are brought to an awareness of their own relative strengths across subjects by a process of internal (ipsative-like) comparison. The frames of reference are within the person. The second basis of the I/E model is social comparison theory. Individuals exercise a process of external (normative-like) comparison with some standards or others in certain settings. For instance, students in a high-achieving school will have a low self-concept and vice versa (Manger & Eikeland, 1997; Marsh, 1987; Marsh, Kong, & Kau, 2000) . The frames of reference are external norms.",

The I/E model was used in early studies to focus on two distinct school subjects: math and verbal skills (Bong, 1998; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988; Williams & Montgomery, 1995) . As a later development, Marsh, Kong, and Hau (2001) extended the I/E model to three subjects: Chinese, English, and math, and Marsh and Yeung (2001) extended the model to math, Spanish, and verbal skills. It is suggested that the I/E model will be best supported for distinct school subjects, for example, math versus verbal skills, and native versus non-native languages. analyzed longitudinal data and found that the results for the I/E model were quite Figure 1 . The frameworks for the I/E model in Marsh and Hau's (2004) study and in the present study. Note: The I/E model predicts (1) a smaller and negative (7) path leading from math (verbal) achievements to verbal (math) self-concepts, controlling for (2) a substantial and positive (\u00fe\u00fe) path leading from math (verbal) achievements to math (verbal) self-concepts. The present study provides no predictions for the cross-subject paths because math and science are likely to be viewed as different or supplementary. The construct intercept term (IT) is included to be estimated for each measured variable. stable over time. The use of the I/E model has been supported for not only general students but also gifted (Lee, Yeung, Low, & Jin, 2000; Plucker & Stocking, 2001 ) and able students (Williams & Montgomery, 1995) .",

There are three levels of equivalence: construct (or structural) equivalence, measurement unit equivalence, and scalar equivalence (or full score comparability). There is often evidence for construct equivalence but lack of scalar equivalence in cross-cultural studies (Van de Vijver & Leung, 2000) . SEM can identify a lack of construct equivalence (Van de Vijver & Leung, 1997) , and multigroup SEM is suitable for examining the external validity of a theory-based model (Sue, 1999) . Multilevel analysis can take account of the hierarchical data structures and separate the models for the various levels (Bryk & Raudenbush, 2002; Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, Congdon, & Du Toit, 2004; Snijders & Bosker, 1999) . A lack of scalar equivalence can be identified by inclusion of the intercept term for each measured variable in the measurement model of SEM (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2006) . The inclusion of intercept terms will allow the estimation of the means among data from different countries in multigroup SEM.

However, math and science are more likely to be regarded as complementary or supplementary than math-and verbalrelated subjects. Math and science show a structure whereby math as the study of pattern and logic (Burton, 1994) is one of the bases of science and can be a powerful tool to model a wide range of domains of world knowledge, especially science. This understanding can further be found in the test content designed for use in the TIMSS 2003 study: Science includes the subject areas of earth science, life science, physics, chemistry, and environmental science, which consist of a wide range of domains of knowledge. Math includes the areas of algebra, data, fractions/numbers, geometry, and measurement, which comprise the knowledge of signs, images, logic, and formula, all of which are widely utilized throughout each area of science. Math, therefore, may be perceived as the basis of science, with the fields of science being a later development, or as a combination of multiple abilities.

It is reasonable to hypothesize that there may be a positive path from math achievement to math selfconcept and a positive path from science achievement to science self-concept (Diagram B in Figure 1 ) based on past studies on affective issues in math and science education. There are, however, no predictions in this present study for the cross-subject paths, because math and science are likely to be regarded as different or supplementary. There are also high correlations between math and science achievements and between math and science selfconcepts. The two negatively worded items for each self-concept scale were set correlated in order to increase goodness-of-fit, which is a procedure similar to that used by Marsh (1994) . In addition, the measurement model includes the intercept terms for each measured variable in order to take account of scalar equivalence.",

                "text": "Second, for cultural difference, there is no literature on academic self-concepts that obviously documents cultural variations in the process of regarding math and science as two extremely different or supplementary school subjects. On the other hand, a continuum of individualism-collectivism (Cheng et al., 1998; Parkes, Schneider, & Bochner, 1999) has long been documented in the cross-cultural research on the nature of self-concept, although it is not completely supported by research (Wastlund, Norlander, & Archer, 2001) . A weak hypothesis therefore is posited: There is a continuum of countries varying from those that regard math and science as complementary or supplementary with an integrating process to those that regard them as distinctly different with a contrasting process. The process of comparison between different subjects, which are strongly based on perceptions of domain knowledge, is therefore termed domain comparison in the present study, and it is possible that culture may play a role in the process. In other words, the frame of reference is the nature or knowledge of domains, which is related to culture. To predict in more detail: For any specific country, with control for the effects of math and science achievements on their matching self-concepts, (1) if an extremely integrating process is undertaken, there will be a positive effect of math and science achievements on nonmatching self-concepts; in contrast, (2) there will be a negative effect of math and science achievements on nonmatching self-concepts if an extremely contrasting process is triggered, as predicted by the original I/E model (Diagram A in Figure 1 ); (3) cultural variations occur in between the extremely integrating and contrasting processes. In other words, there is no need to utilize symmetric cross-subject paths, or the sizes of the two cross-subject paths may not be the same size or moving in the same direction (Diagram B in Figure 1 ).",

All the values of the 18 items were transformed into standardized z scores (M \u00bc 0, SD \u00bc 1), respectively, based on the data of all students from the 28 countries. The relative position of each student in the total group remained the same for each indicator, and, therefore, this procedure will not eliminate cultural differences in analysis. This standardization procedure can facilitate the use of SEM processes and data presentation formats, which is of especial use in this present study as there are large differences in the score ranges between achievements and self-concepts. For instance, if raw scores are used for the multigroup SEM procedure, the common metric standardized solutions for all the achievement scores will be larger than 100.00 and those for self-concepts will be smaller than 1.00. In fact, analyses of the raw scores and standardized scores result in the same standardized solutions of parameter estimates (e.g., those in Table 1 ) and values of fit indices (e.g., those in Table 2 and Table 4 ).

(3) Tight cross-validation: All parameter estimates are invariant across groups, such as factor loading, interfactor covariance, and error variance equivalence. Tight cross-validation is ideal but hard to achieve, especially in the aspect of error variance equivalence. Loose cross-validation is utilized as the basis of invariance tests as each group is examined for their individual goodness-of-fit to a model; no comparison fit is made between the groups. As for partial cross-validation, error variances are regarded as the least important parameters and allowed to be freely estimated across groups first. Path parameters are normally the focus in a study and viewed as the most important estimates. The next important parameters are factor loadings. Some other parameters are of middle degrees of importance, for example, construct intercept terms, factor covariance, factor variances, and covariance between latent variables.

The solutions for both single-level analysis (TG1) and multilevel analysis (TG2) ( Table 1) revealed that the data showed a good fit to the proposed framework. All CFI and NNFI values were above .900 and RMSEA values below .100 (Table 2) . Table 1 shows that some parameter estimates in a standardized format from the singlelevel SEM were the same as those from the multilevel SEM. The parameter estimates revealed that the a priori model was proper, with no problems of multicollinearity (Marsh, Dowson, Pietsch, & Walker, 2004) . The path coefficients were consistent with the predictions of the original I/E model (Diagram A in Figure 1 ): (1) negative paths from math achievement to science self-concept (-.49) and from science achievement to math self-concept (-.15) and (2) positive paths from math achievement to math self-concept (.20) and from science achievement to science self-concept (.34). The values of uniqueness were all significant at the .05 level. All the standard errors of each of the parameter estimates were .00 or .01. (The standard errors are not presented, as the estimates in Table  1 are standardized solutions.) The correlations between the latent constructs (i.e., the standardized solutions shown as variance-covariance matrices) were all below .90. But correlations between math and science achievement were slightly high (.85). In comparison with the results in Marsh and Hau's (2004) study, the correlation between math and verbal achievement was .78 for the single-level total group solution. It is not surprising that there is a much higher relationship between math and science achievements. In Marsh and Hau's study, the correlation between math and verbal self-concepts is .11, and here the correlation is .46. The high correlation between math and science self-concepts violates the starting point of the original I/E model: high correlations between math and verbal achievements but zero to weak correlations between math and verbal self-concepts. An odd phenomenon is that there were negative correlations between math achievement and science self-concept (-.20) in this present study and between science achievement and science self-concept (-.07). In Marsh and Hau's study, these two correlations were close to zero. Further discussion of this finding will be presented in the general discussion.",

                "text": "Multigroup CFA was used to examine whether the measurement model is invariant across groups (e.g., the 28 countries here), while multigroup SEM was used to examine the degrees of goodness-of-fit for the proposed model across groups. The models with more constraints (i.e., MG4, 5, 9, and 10) were a poor fit to the data (CFI and NNFI below .900 and RMSEA above .200); the models with fewer constraints (i.e., MG1, 2, and 6-8) revealed an acceptable fit to the data (CFI and NNFI above .900; RMSEA slightly larger than .100). A critical comparison was made between the two nested models, MG7 (path Table 1 . Parameter estimates for total-group solution, three-level total-group solution, and multigroup solution. coefficient (PC), construct intercept terms (IT), and uniqueness free) and MG8 (IT and uniqueness free). The multigroup equivalence tests offer an acceptable support for the claim of an equivalence of the path coefficients across countries because there were only small differences between fit-index values of the two models (DCFI\u00bc.002, DNNFI \u00bc .000, DRMSEA \u00bc .000; though Dw 108 2 \u00bc 11423.293, p 5 .05). Table 1 shows that the parameter estimates obtained by Model MG10 analysis (cf. Table 2) were the same as those obtained by the Model TG1 and TG2 analyses; this suggests the stability of the parameter estimates over the three kinds of SEM procedures. In the first line of Table 3 , the total group solution is obtained by an analysis of Model MG10. The path coefficients were consistent with the predictions of the I/E model. In summary, the results of multigroup cultural equivalence tests show acceptable support for the prediction of the original I/E model. However, if we take a closer look at the parameter values of the cross paths, we can find a wide variation in the values across countries. In other words, the results for the proportions of countries as completely contrasting or integrating countries tell a different story. The proportions of countries with a complete fit to the I/E model (contrasting process) were .77 (\u00bc20/26) in Marsh and Hau's (2004) study and .39 (\u00bc11/28) here. An explanation for the low proportion of countries that completely fit the I/E model here can be referred to in the origins of the I/E model. In Marsh and Hau's study, the mean factor Table 2 . Goodness-of-fit indices for the I/E model fit to the total group and multiple groups. correlation between math and verbal skills for all the countries is .76 (SD \u00bc .05), and here it is .70 (SD \u00bc .09) between math and science. The difference is small. There is, however, a large difference in the factor correlations of the two self-concepts between the two studies. In Marsh and Hau's study, the factor correlations between the two self-concepts were between -.20 and .52 (M \u00bc .06, SD \u00bc .17) across countries, and here between .03 and .59 (M \u00bc .37, SD \u00bc .14). It is also clear in Marsh and Hau's study that a complete fit to the I/ E model occurred for the 20 countries with smaller factor correlations (-.20 to .18) between math and verbal self-concept and that the correlations were positive and larger (.13 to .52) for the other six countries. Here, the results for the three integrating countries showed the highest correlations between math and science self-concepts (.56, .54, and .59) among the 28 countries. An interesting phenomenon is that a complete I/E-model-fit (contrasting process) did occur even though the correlations between math and science self-concepts were high in the 11 countries as shown in Table 3 . This issue will be discussed further in the next section on the ''Cultural comparison test of the I/E model.'' The results of the country equivalence tests reveal an acceptable fit, but there are slightly different parameter values across countries and less than adequate fits in the case of more constrained models. In other words, some countries show an integrating process, that is, with significantly positive cross-subject paths, though the values are small (.05 to .09). It is therefore sensible to let each country produce their own respective accounts of the I/E model fit. Marsh and Hau's (2004) study showed a generally good I/E-model fit across countries, which is perhaps why they did not decide to look further into the matter for each country.",

                "text": "The data of each country were separately examined for their fit to the a priori model (Diagram B in Figure 1 ) using the procedure of multilevel SEM at the levels of classes and students. The procedure can be regarded as a loose cross-validation. The fit indices revealed a good fit for each country (all CFI and NNFI 4 .900 and RMSEA 5 .100) (Table 4) . As is similar to the case for the factor correlations in Table 3 , the factor correlations between math and science self-concepts were all positive and mostly not small (.04 to .62, M \u00bc .37, SD \u00bc .14) and those between math and science achievements were consistently large (.50 to .83, M \u00bc .70, SD \u00bc .08). The correlations between math and science self-concepts were .13 to 43 for the 10 contrasting countries and .45 to .62 for the four integrating countries. Marsh developed his theory of the I/E model based on the repeated findings that there were large correlations between math and verbal achievements (.42 to .94) and small correlations between math and verbal self-concepts (-.10 to \u00fe .19) (cf. Marsh, 1986 ). The present findings revealed that a fit to the I/E-model occurred in 10 countries even though their math and science self-concepts were positively correlated (.13 to .43). A speculation is that the students in the 10 countries were representative of students who may function psychologically using a contrasting process. The students in the 10 countries have a clear, differentiated system of academic self-concepts in regard to a comparison of math and science. They make a clear distinction between their math and science abilities, although their math and science achievements were highly correlated and their math and science self-concepts were also correlated. On the other hand, the four integrating countries showed a relatively less differentiated system of self-concepts for math and science; they tend to regard math and science as relatively supplementary to each other. Their achievements in either math or science could increase not only their matchingsubject self-concepts but also their nonmatching subject self-concepts. A final note to make is that there are more contrasting countries than integrating countries (10:4), which explains why the results of the overall population test were consistent with the predictions of the original I/E model. On the other hand, there are four significantly integrating countries and 14 countries in between the two extreme poles along the continuum of contrasting-integrating. Among these 14 countries, (1) four countries provide partial support for the contrasting (I/E) prediction, that is, one of the cross paths is significantly negative and the other is nonsignificant; (2) three countries lend partial support to the supplementary prediction, that is, one of the cross paths is significantly positive and the other is nonsignificant; (3) three countries lend partial support to both the contrasting and supplementary predictions, that is, one of the cross paths is significantly negative and the other is significantly positive; and (4) four countries failed to provide support for either the contrasting or the supplementary prediction, that is, none of the cross paths is significant (Table 4 ). The fact that countries vary in degrees of support for contrasting or supplementary predictions suggests a need for a new view of the theory of the I/E model.",

The original I/E model focuses on two psychological processes: internal comparison and external comparison. Studies utilizing the I/E model have traditionally focused on extremely distinct school subjects, for example, math and verbal skills, and then there has been little or no interest in a comparison based on the nature of school subjects or domains of knowledge. Math and science are two highly related school subjects in nature, and so another psychological process, termed ''domain comparison'', based on transition points along a continuum of integration-contrast, can be distinguished. In other words, there may be at least three psychological processes underpinning the development of multidimensional academic selfconcepts: internal, external, and domain comparison.",

This claim is supported by the present findings, which include (1) high correlations between math and science self-concepts, and (2) differential country performance, with 4 out of 28 countries showing an integrating process and 10 countries showing a contrasting process. Cultural differences in the integrating or contrasting processes suggest the likely presence of local cultural stereotypes as to the nature and relations of domains of knowledge. Perspectives as to whether different domains are supplementary or different will influence the behavior of students in making a career choice and their allocation of time and effort in building up their expertise. Calibration of academic self-concepts may be beneficial only if the knowledge of the results of the calibration is beneficial in supporting the positive development of students' competence and skills (cf. Pintrich, 2003) . The inclusion of the process of domain comparison into the model of multidimensional self-concept or the I/E model will help serve such a purpose. Future research may tackle this issue more directly by the collection of data on students' perspectives on the relations of different domains along a continuum of different (contrasting) to supplementary (integrating).",

First, 4 out of the 28 countries showed an integrating process, and 10 countries showed a contrasting process (Table 4) , but we can hardly offer any straightforward answer regarding transition points given the small sample size. There is, however, a trend in that most integrating countries are located in the Middle East (3 out of 4) and that most contrasting countries (9 out of 10) use English as part of their official language(s). If this difference is attributed to the dichotomy between individualism and collectivism, a phenomenon highly documented in crosscultural studies, it may provide an easy but premature answer. Future research can be done on this issue further. Second, the negative relations between math achievement and science self-concept (-.20 in Table 1 ) dictate the possibility that there is a critical country factor ''moderating'' (Baron & Kenny, 1986) these relationships. A likely country factor is the big-fish-little-pond effect, whereby the same able students in high-achieving groups tend to have a lower self-concept than those in low-achieving groups (Manger & Eikeland, 1997; Marsh et al., 2000; Marsh & Parker, 1984; Marsh & Rowe, 1996) . As Leung's (2002) study indicated, students in the high-achieving Asian countries participating in the TIMSS study confessed a lower self-concept in learning math than those in some other countries. The multilevel SEM performed here did not aim to identify effective country factors in moderating the proposed processes (Figure 1 ). There are other kinds of multilevel analysis procedures that can be utilized to identify specific country moderators (e.g., Bryk & Raudenbush, 2002; Muthe\u00b4n & Muthe\u00b4n, 1998 Raudenbush et al., 2004; Snijders & Bosker, 1999) . Combining mediators and moderators into the I/E model will make the theory more complicated but may be a way to further elaborate the theory.",

First, the proposed study framework failed to address the issue of reciprocal relations between self-concepts and achievements; such reciprocal or causal relations can be investigated using a number of waves of data. Second, the measurement model is not completely acceptable universally. Although both general and multigroup CFAs reveal an acceptable fit, the reliability coefficients for the internal consistency of the self-concept scales in some countries are below .50 (Table 3 ) and all the factor loadings of the negatively worded items (MSC3, MSC4, SSC3, and SSC4) were below .50 ( Table 1) . Items that are negatively worded appear to be unreliable in cross-cultural studies. A similar phenomenon was found in the PISA 2003 study; one negatively worded item on verbal skills was reported as undesirable and had to be excluded from analysis, as reported in Marsh and Hau's (2004) study. Marsh (1994) raised a similar issue in analyzing the data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988. He dealt with the problem by setting correlated errors between the negatively worded items and suggested that positively and negatively worded items have different constructs in measurement. The present findings imply that interpretations of negatively worded items may vary across countries. Future research can investigate construct differences between negatively and positively worded items across culture.",
