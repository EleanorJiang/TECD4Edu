In the past 10 years, however, there has been a discernable increase in theoretical and empirical contributions on emotions in education. This increased interest is reXected in three recent special issues (Efklides & Volet, 2005; Linnenbrink, 2006; Schutz & Lanehart, 2002) and an edited volume (Schutz & Pekrun, in press ) on this topic. However, despite this increased interest in academic emotions, relatively few studies have focused on positive emotions like enjoyment, pride, and hope as experienced in educational settings (Pekrun, Goetz, Titz, & Perry, 2002a) . To date, educational studies have mainly focused on negative emotional experiences such as test anxiety (Zeidner, 1998) . The lack of educational research on positive emotions is surprising, given that the importance of positive emotions has been documented by a large number studies conducted in the context of positive psychology (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) .",

However, while these studies assessed constructs that are considered to be related to emotions (Roseman & Smith, 2001 ), they did not examine the nature of positive emotions per se (Hidi, Renninger, & Krapp, 2004) . Consequently, this related body of research should be distinguished from research focusing explicitly on emotions, and more speciWcally, students' positive emotional experiences. Pekrun et al. (2002a) suggested that positive emotions are worthy of investigation because they \"help to envision goals and challenges, open the mind to thoughts and problem-solving, protect health by fostering resiliency, create attachments to signiWcant others, lay the groundwork for individual self-regulation, and guide the behaviour of groups, social systems, and nations\" (p. 149). In the same vein, Fredrickson (2001) stated that \"positive emotions are worth cultivating, not just as end states in themselves but also as a means to achieving psychological growth and improved well-being over time\" (p. 218).",

Pekrun, Goetz, Titz, and Perry (2002b) highlighted the relevance of positive academic emotions with respect to self-regulation, strategy use, motivation, and activation of cognitive resources in students. Aspinwall (1998) also argued that positive academic emotions can eVectively contribute to self-regulatory processes in students. Furthermore, positive emotions have been found to positively relate to student involvement in terms of course enrollment, career aspirations, and occupational choices in speciWc domains (cf., WigWeld, Battle, Keller, & Eccles, 2002) . For example, if students experience fewer positive emotions related to mathematics, they are signiWcantly less likely to pursue a career in this domain, irrespective of their performance in this subject area. Taken together, extant research suggests that positive emotional experiences play an important role in academic achievement settings, and can have a considerable impact on students' cognitions, behavior, and ultimate success in the academic domain.",

According to this model, the subjective evaluation of one's performance is based not only on social comparisons (external frame of reference), but also on cross-domain or dimensional comparisons (internal frame of reference) implying a comparison of one's own achievement in a subject area with achievement in other subjects. Empirically, this assumption has repeatedly been conWrmed by Wndings showing negative relationships between achievement indicators in one subject and self-concept in another subject, when achievement in the second subject was controlled for (e.g., Skaalvik & Rankin, 1995) .

This theory implies that two types of appraisals are of speciWc relevance for the arousal of achievement-related emotions: appraisals of control over achievement activities and their outcomes, and of the value of these activities and outcomes. Achievement-related expectancies (including self-eYcacy and outcome expectancies; Pekrun, 1992) , causal attributions for achievement outcomes (Weiner, 1985) , and self-concepts of ability are seen as control-related cognitions, and subjective values as well as achievement goals are seen as implying value appraisals. Any achievement-related emotion is assumed to be a joint product of control and value appraisals, including students' enjoyment which is posited to be aroused when learning is perceived as both controllable and valuable (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun, Elliot, & Maier, 2006) . Since self-eYcacy expectancies, causal attributions, self-concepts of ability, subjective task values, and achievement goals have all been found to be domain-speciWc, one of the corollaries of the control-value theory is that achievement emotions should also show weak between-domain relations.",

The scale consisted of three items (e.g., \"I enjoy my math classes\"). For enjoyment related to language classes (i.e., German), the same items were used, with the term \"German\" used instead of \"math.\" The response format for both scales consisted of a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Reliabilities were D .88 (M D 8.66; SD D 3.32) for the math-related enjoyment scale and D .91 (M D 8.74; SD D 3.57) for the language enjoyment scale. Means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations for all enjoyment items are shown in the Appendix A. A previous mathematics-speciWc study by Goetz (2004, N D 784 , grades 5-10, 54% female) indicated high validity of the class-related enjoyment scale (correlations were r D .63 with learning-related enjoyment, .70 with test-related enjoyment, \u00a1.59 with class-related boredom, .65 with academic self-concept, and .41 with achievement).",

Subsequently, we tested for invariance of the latent structures in each model by comparing a model having freely varying structural weights with a model having both gender-invariant measurement weights, and gender-invariant structural weights. If this stepwise inclusion of invariance constraints resulted in little or no change in model Wt, it could be inferred that the models were structurally equivalent for both subsamples.

While controlling for these within-domain eVects, the anticipated I/E eVect was observed in terms of signiWcant negative cross-domain eVects in both directions, with mathematics achievement being negatively related to verbal enjoyment (\u00a1.20, p < .01), and verbal performance being negatively related to enjoyment in mathematics (\u00a1.21, p < .01). These cross-domain relationships were signiWcant, though weaker, than the within-domain relationships.",

Because the 2 diVerence test can be considered a very conservative test in view of our large sample size (Brannick, 1995; Kelloway, 1995) , as noted above, this provides strong support for gender invariance of the measurement weights for the constructs under investigation. When the structural weights were also constrained to gender invariance, the 2 diVerence test again indicated no signiWcant loss of the Wt of Models A through C (see Table 3 When assessing loss of model Wt due to the imposed equivalence of measurement and structural weights, the CFI was found to remain constant. In terms of the RMSEA, the more constrained models were in fact found to Wt the data better (see Table 3 ). Overall, the results of these nested model comparisons strongly support the premise that the pattern of structural relations between achievement, self-concepts, and enjoyment for male vs. female students did not diVer signiWcantly. That is, these results suggest that gender did not moderate the relations between our study measures, thus corroborating the assumed cross-gender universality of these relations.",

In view of our Wndings on the domain-speciWc organization of academic enjoyment, it can be assumed that teachers' domain-general conceptions can lead to false inferences regarding the emotions experienced by individual students in diVerent domains. For example, a teacher may incorrectly assume that a student who is bored in his or her class also feels bored in most other classes.

Our study revealed that academic enjoyment is strongly related to domain-speciWc academic self-concepts which, in turn, are related to antecedent academic achievement. By implication, it can be assumed that teachers could attempt to enhance students' academic enjoyment by focusing on improving students' academic skills, a process described by Marsh \"as the best way to improve self-concept and interest\" (Marsh et al., 2005, p. 413) .

As a corollary, this skill improvement may also have deleterious consequences for students' enjoyment in other domains. How can this dilemma be resolved? To deal adequately with this problem requires more knowledge about why achievement in one domain has negative eVects on students' self-concept in other domains. That is, further knowledge concerning the cognitive processes underlying dimensional comparisons is needed.",

Thus, improving academic skills may not be the most eVective means of enhancing students' self-concepts and positive emotions. One solution to this problem may be to encourage teachers to deemphasize social comparison in the classroom, and instead adopt an individual frame of reference when providing achievement-related feedback (i.e., ipsative teacher feedback).",

As argued above, gender stereotyping (e.g., the perception of mathematics as a male-oriented academic domain) is assumed to be one critical factor underlying these gender diVerences. At the same time, however, the results of this study suggest that the interrelations between achievement, self-concept, and enjoyment are invariant across the two genders. This Wnding is encouraging for educators in implying that any intervention attempting to foster students' emotions by enhancing their achievement and self-concepts should be equally eVective for male and female students.",
