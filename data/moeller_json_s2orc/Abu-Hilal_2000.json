                "text": "multidimensional, hierarchical structure and construct validity of SC. Numerous within-network and between-network studies in the West have established the multidimensionality, hierarchy, and construct validity of SC. This paper examined the generalizability of results derived from: (a) the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ), Shavelson, Hubner & Stanton (1976) theory of SC, and (b) Marsh's revisions to the theory and the internal/external (I/E) frame of reference model. This study is important in that it provides an opportunity to examine the situated generalizability of results in the context of different linguistic and cultural boundaries. Marsh (1993) stated that \"self-concept researchers often evaluate age or gender effects in different components of self-concept\" (p.843) in an implicit indication that SC is a developmental construct. Shavelson et al. (1976) and Marsh (1985) posited that children's self-concepts become more differentiated with age. Marsh (1988) explained that as children grow \"they incorporate more external information into their self-concepts\" and \" as children incorporate more information about their actual skills and abilities as well as feedback from others, into the formation of their self-concepts in different areas, their self-concepts will also become differentiated\" (p.124). Accordingly, maturity would lead to smaller correlations among various dimensions of SC, and to larger correlations between SC and external constructs. Shavelson et al. (1976) demonstrated that self-concept becomes multifaceted with age. Marsh, Barnes, Cairns and Tidman (1984) found that younger children scored significantly higher than older children did on most of the SDQ scales. Marsh et al. (1984) compared the responses of preadolescent children with those of adolescent children and concluded that the effect of age was linear for preadolescent years and non-linear during adolescent years. However, Marsh (1990) reported that studies that employed overall scores for SC had found no evidence for any age effect. The evidence for age effect on SC dimensions, or even overall SC, is scarce in the published work of Arab researchers. Since age has been one of the main features of the Shavelson et al.'s theory of SC, it is important that the relationship of SC with age, as indicated by grade level, be considered with nonwestern samples. Shavelson et al. (1976) proposed a model of SC which has been considered by many as a well-defined model, and which has been supported by subsequent research (e.g., Byrne & Shavelson, 1986; Marsh, 1988; 1990) . Some important modifications, however, have been added to the model (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985; Shavelson & Marsh, 1986) . These revisions pertain to academic SC and the revised form of the model has been designated the Marsh /Shavelson Model of Academic SC. Marsh and Shavelson (1985) and Shavelson and Marsh (1986) posited that academic SC is not a uni-dimensional construct. Rather, math and reading SCs have been proposed and found to form two weakly-related facets. This position was supported by the majority of studies conducted in the West (see Marsh 1986 , 1988 , and 1990 , Marsh & Shavelson, 1985 ; however, it was not supported by non-western samples (Abu-Hilal & Aal-Hussain, 1997) .",

Lyon (1993) highlighted the importance of the relationship between SC and academic achievement, and stated that \"academic self-concept is theoretically more closely related to academic achievement than most other cognitive variables\" (p. 203). Marsh, Parker and Barnes (1985) indicated that the substantial correlations between different areas of SC and academic ability and performance measures provide evidence for the construct validity of SC. Marsh (1986) presented the relationship between achievement and SC in a novel and unique fashion with his phenomenal internal/external (I/E) frame of reference model. The I/E model has been considered as \"a major development in self-perception theory\" (e.g., Skaalvik & Rankin, 1995) which provides an explanation for the surprising relationship among SC dimensions. Also, it clarifies the cross-links between math and verbal achievements, and math and verbal SCs. Based on the correlations between math and verbal achievements (r's=.50 to .80), Marsh expected that math and verbal self-concepts would be similarly related. Surprisingly, Marsh and his associates have found that math and verbal SCs are nearly uncorrelated-leading to the revision of the original Shavelson et al. (1976) model and to the proposal of the I/E model (see Marsh, 1988 Marsh, , 1990 Marsh, Byrne & Shavelson, 1988) .",

Marsh and Shavelson (1985) stated that \"\u2026 students based their academic self-concepts in particular subjects on how their ability in that subject compares with other students (external comparison) and how their ability in that particular subject compares with their abilities in other subjects (internal comparisons)\" (p. 120). Based on the substantial correlation that he and his associates had found between math and verbal achievements, Marsh (1986) proposed that the external comparison process should produce a positive correlation between math and verbal SCs. The internal comparison, however, should lead to a negative correlation between the same two constructs of SC, because math and verbal achievements are compared with each other. Also, Marsh and Yeung (1998) hypothesized that the internal comparison process predicts that good math skills lead to lower English SC and good English skills lead to lower math SC. On the other hand, the external comparison process, as Marsh and Yeung (1998) argued, \"predicts that good math skills lead to higher math self-concept and that good English skills lead to higher English self-concept.\" (p. 711). The joint operation of both processes will lead to a correlation between math and verbal SCs that is substantially lower than the correlation between math and verbal achievements. These predictions of the I/E model have received considerable support by several studies in the West (e.g., Byrne & Shavelson, 1987; Marsh, 1986 Marsh, , 1988 Marsh, , 1994 Marsh, Byrne & Shavelson, 1988; Marsh, Walker & Debus, 1991; Marsh & Yeung, 1998) .",

The correlation between the academic and non-academic secondorder factors was 1.0. Model 4A, in which parents SC loaded on the two secondorder factors, produced a \u03c7 2 of 838.22, df=341. In Model 4A, the correlation between the two second-order factors was .92. Model 5A which posited three second-order factors -academic/verbal, academic/math, and non-academic-resulted in a \u03c7 2 of 804.31, df =337. In model 5A, the two second-order academic factors (verbal and math) were highly correlated (r = .83). These results suggest that elementary students were not able to distinguish between their worth in the two academic areas. Even the distinction that elementary students made between academic and non-academic SCs was weak, as the correlation between the two constructs reflects. Based on the substantial difference in \u03c7 2 statistic (\u2206\u03c7 2 =52.2, df = 4), between models 2A and 5A, model 5A seemed to fit data better did than the other three models, and provided support to the positions of Marsh and Shavelson (1985) that verbal and math SCs break into two distinct constructs. However, our results indicated that the two constructs are strongly related-in contradiction to Marsh and Shavelson -who found that the two constructs were non-correlated. Junior high students sample. Table 3 shows that models 2B and 3B provided the poorest fit to data. Model 4B had much improved fit over models 2B and 3B. The \u03c7 2 statistic for model 4B was 737.21, df =341. The correlation between academic and non-academic constructs was rather large (r = .55). Model 5B, however, was the best fitting model of all competing models (\u03c7 2 =714.44, df =337). Model 5B fits the data nearly as well as model 1B. The correlation between verbal and math SCs was still substantial (r = .37), though significantly smaller than the correlation between the two constructs for elementary students. Despite the significant correlation between verbal and math SCs, the results of the HCFA supported the proposition of Marsh and Shavelson (1985) that SC is hierarchically organised, with three distinct factors at the apex. However the results of this study revealed that these constructs are significantly related, particularly verbal and math SCs.",

The present study provided reasonable support to the multidimensionality and, to a lesser degree, to the hierarchy of SC. The pattern of relations between verbal and math achievements and verbal and math SCs was tested in the I/E model shown in Figure 1 . For elementary students, the \u03c7 2 for this model was 242.98, df = 32, CFI = .87, TLI = .80, and RMSEA = .16. For junior high students, the \u03c7 2 for the model was 171.07, df = 32, CFI = .93, TLI = .90 and RMSEA = .13. Consistent with predictions and with the findings of previous research, verbal and math grades were highly correlated for elementary students (r = .82) and for junior high students (r = .64). The correlations between verbal and math SCs, however, were substantially lower than the correlations between verbal and math achievements (r =. 24 for elementary students, r=.02 for junior high students). Figure 1 shows the path coefficients and correlations among the four constructs for each of the two samples. The I/E model predicts positive paths from verbal achievement to verbal SC and from math achievement to math SC. These paths were significantly positive for both elementary and junior high students. However, math achievement had greater influence on math SC than verbal achievement had on verbal SC. These results are consistent with the findings obtained by Marsh, Smith, Barnes and Butler (1983) with a western sample.",

Specifically, the autocratic and rather protecting practices at home do not encourage children's independence. Compared to the western family, Sharabi (1975) found that the Arab family raises its children in such a way that its children become less independent and less responsible. Similarly, the rigid autocratic school system does not seem to encourage students to be independent: it does not give children the opportunity to evaluate themselves. The implication of this kind of socialisation and education for SC formation and development is that dependent children lack the skills to evaluate their worthiness clearly in various areas of school and life. While collecting the data for this study, the researcher noticed that students were surprised when they heard the items that required them to evaluate their skills and performance in various school subjects. More than one student commented 'are you sure you want us to judge our performance? I think that teachers can tell you better than we can.'

Marsh (1985) and Stipek (1981) found the SCs of young western children to be unrealistic and less differentiated. Arab and western younger children do not differ greatly in how good they perceive themselves to be, however, they do differ in the way in which they value themselves across various areas of SC. Whereas western children are able to distinguish their worth in various areas, Arab students seem to genralize their worth across SC areas. That is, if one sees him/herself as being good in one area, then he/she generalizes this perception to other areas. For example, if an Arab child perceives him/herself to be good in math it is very likely that he/she thinks that he/she is good in language, good in school in general, and good in his/her relations with parents, etc. Older Arab children (junior high students), however, were more able to distinguish their worth across SC areas than younger Arab children were, but not to the level at which one can claim independence among some of those areas. Therefore, whereas western researchers (e.g., Marsh, 1990) found that math and verbal SCs, for example, were uncorrelated, the present study failed to provide support for this supposition.",

As for younger Arab students, it is either that their perceptions of self are ambiguous, or their levels of comprehension of the items were not adequate to elicit the proper responses.

Also, in order to understand how internal and external processes operate, some explanation of the two subjects (Arabic language and math) included in the I/E model in terms of content, difficulty, and assessment is required. Arabic language, which represents verbal achievement, comprises reading, composition, dictation and grammar. These areas are new, and therefore more challenging, to elementary students. Math, on the other hand, deals with simple calculations and computations. As students move to higher grades, the situation reverses. Students become better readers; they can write more skilfully and most topics of grammar have been covered in lower grades. In other words, students become more accustomed to the topics of language. However, the topics of math become more difficult and more diverse.",

Students can identify their strengths and weaknesses in math more easily and clearly than they can identify their strengths and weaknesses in language. For teachers, the assessment of math is much more objective and straightforward than the assessment of language. Furthermore, very little is known about the psychometric characteristics of teacher-made tests and overall evaluation either in these two subjects or in other subjects. However, from the statistics produced in this study one can speculate that inflation in the grades is possible, especially for younger students. The means of verbal and math scores for elementary students are 74.84 and 70.24, respectively. In contrast, the means for junior high students for the two subjects are equal (M = 68.9) indicating consistency in assessment. Thus, the argument of Marsh (1990) that high verbal skills detract from high math SC and vice versa may apply to junior high students, but not to elementary students. In sum, the relationship between achievement and SC for elementary students is more complex than the I/E model can explain. This is probably due to the high correlation between verbal and math scores, and to the weak reliability in verbal scores. Whatever the explanation, it is recommended that this study be replicated with larger samples of elementary students, with various indicators for achievement (e.g., standardised tests) to further test the SC structure and I/E model in non-western educational settings.",

Younger students scored higher than older students on five of the seven subscales, but significantly higher on two (math and school) of those five. This research favors the argument of Marsh (1990) that the decline in SC with age should evoke praise, and not blame for the school. Marsh argued further that \"as children grow older they gain more realistic appraisals of their relative strengths and weaknesses\u2026. Perhaps it would be unfortunate if self-concept did not become more realistic on the basis of additional life experience.\" (p. 110). Indeed, the decline in SC with age occurred in the academic areas of SC in which students usually get feedback. In non-academic areas, however, students get less systematic and frequent feedback than in academic areas. Hence, older students become more realistic and can more easily differentiate SCs in the academic areas.",
