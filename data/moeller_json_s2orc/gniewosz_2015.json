In this study, we investigate the possible influence of the achievementrelated feedback provided by the school and parents on the academic self-concept and subjective task value. In early adolescence, a lot of changes take place. For instance, during secondary school transition, the feedback structures and frames of references in the school context change tremendously (for an overview see Wigfield, Eccles, Schiefele, Roeser, & Davis-Kean, 2006) . As a consequence, academic beliefs and values have to be restructured (e.g., Cole et al., 2001; Eccles, 1993; Watt, 2004) . Developmentalists have argued that transitions offer a unique opportunity to study developmental change because individuals experience many changes. Ruble (1994) argued that at these times of major transition there is an increased need for external information about own competencies in order to adapt to new context characteristics. Therefore, early adolescents should be more susceptible to contextual feedback during this time of an ecological transition (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) than in times of stable beliefs and values, for instance after the transition (Cole et al., 2001 ). Parents and academic grades are two common sources of such information at this developmental period.",

In turn, task values are hypothesized to be influenced by the individual's general self-schemas, such as academic self-concept, as well as socializers' beliefs and behaviors. Moreover, the socializers' beliefs and behaviors as well as the students' academic experiences should also affect the academic self-concept. This study is based on these hypotheses (see Figure 1) .",

Recent research suggests that students' academic self-concepts are influenced by achievement-related feedback (grades, test scores) from multiple academic domains (Chen, Yeh, Hwang, & Lin, 2013; Dickh\u20ac auser, 2005; M\u20ac oller, Pohlmann, K\u20ac oller, & Marsh, 2009) . A prominent model addressing this line of thought is the internal-external frame of reference model (Marsh, 1986; M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) . Within an academic domain, there is usually a strong positive relation between grades and academic self-concept due in part to external social comparison processes. In contrast, there is often a weak negative relationship between the grades in one subject area (e.g., mathematics) and individuals' ability self-concept in another subject area (e.g., language arts) due to internal comparison processes associated with between-subject area comparisons within a person. Thus, we predict a positive association between grades and academic self-concepts within a subject area and negative associations between grades and academic self-concepts across subject areas.",

Parents communicate their views about the ability of their children through a variety of mechanisms. For example, parents provide different learning opportunities according to their views of the children's abilities and make differential attributions for their children's academic successes and failures (Eccles, 1993) . This serves as feedback for the students' own appraisals of their academic competence. Thus, we expect positive associations between parental beliefs and their children's academic ability beliefs within an academic domain. As we expect the parents to be a valid source of domain-specific feedback for the adolescents, it seems likely that the same processes associated with cross-domain comparison discussed in the previous paragraph will also lead to a negative association between parental beliefs in one subject area and their children's ability self-beliefs in a different subject area. Therefore, we expect negative cross-subject area associations of parents' competence perceptions and the early adolescents' academic self-concepts. Other studies have shown that parents' estimates of their children's academic abilities are highly associated with their children's grades within a subject area (Dai, 2002) and that the association of grades with children's academic ability self-concepts are mediated by the association of grades with parents' perceptions of their children's abilities (Eccles, 1993) . Accordingly, we hypothesize that the association of academic grades with students' self-concepts will be mediated through their parents' views of their relative competencies.",

As the literature review showed, there are pieces of this model that are partially supported by empirical evidence. This study aims to put these jigsaw pieces together and test the EVM assumptions in one comprehensive mediation model. Moreover, we extend the theoretical framework by bringing in the multidomain frame of reference perspective. Thus, we investigate the following mediational pathways: grades ? parents' competence perceptions ? self-concept ? intrinsic task value. At each stage of this meditational pathway, we apply a frame of reference perspective by including two academic domains and their interrelations. This study goes beyond existing research in the following ways. First, the mediational pathway predicting how feedback is associated with the development of early adolescents' value and belief system, as indicated in the EVM, has not been tested comprehensively. Second, grades and parental competence beliefs have rarely been considered as feedback sources together even though they likely coexist for most children. Third, we investigate this mediational chain both within and across two major academic domains and thus provide insights into how feedback sources (school and family) as well as feedback domains (mathematics and language) jointly contribute to the development of early adolescents' academic self-concepts and task values. Fourth, we include both maternal and paternal data. Because most research on parental influences on adolescents' academic development is based on maternal predictions, very little is known about the paternal role in this area of study. According to a parent-equivalent model (O'Bryan, Fishbein, & Ritchey, 2004), we do not expect differences in the association patterns between mothers and fathers. Finally, by including two similar but yet different samples, we will both demonstrate the replicability of our findings and know more about the generalizability of the findings. Consistent with Robins (1978) , we think that \"In the long run, the best evidence for the truth of any observation lies in its replicability across studies\" (p. 611).",

This information serves as an independent and domain-specific source of information for the adolescents. Within domain, these positive effects were shown in both the mathematics and the language domains. The predicted negative cross-domain effects were mainly found in the mathematics domain. Here, parents' estimates of their child's language competence negatively predicted changes in the early adolescents' mathematics ability self-concept. Thus, these findings are consistent with our hypothesis that both sources of domain-specific achievement-related feedback are integrated into the students' competence beliefs in the mathematics domain. Parents can communicate their beliefs to their children in several ways (Eccles, 1993) : (1) directly by encouraging them to do better in school or praising them for good grades and (2) indirectly through their behaviors such as helping with schoolwork or organizing private tutoring.

The relevance of our results is based on the integrative description of the theoretical line of argument starting with the achievement-based feedback and showing the transmission of this information through both parents and students' competence perceptions to the intrinsic task value in two academic domains. This study contributes to the understanding of how feedback information might be transformed into motivation-relevant values. There is strong evidence that these values, in turn, mediate effects of academic self-concepts and values on subsequent achievement (Roeser & Eccles, 1998) . Despite the differences between the samples, school systems, and contexts in which the studies were conducted, the patterns of associations and mediation and in most cases even the effect sizes were by and large parallel for both samples and in both maternal and paternal models. Thus, we think that we can generalize the reported results to other samples, but this remains to be shown empirically. The processes feeding into the formation and stabilization of academic self-concepts and the intrinsic task values seem to be similar in both contexts and feedback sources.",

In this respect, our study can be seen as an application of Bronfenbrenner's ecological model (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) . Our findings suggest that the microsystem family as represented by the parents and the microsystem school as represented by its provision of academic marks to both children and parents likely influence the development of academic self-perceptions and values in both direct and indirect ways. In addition, mesosystemic influences are evident in the fact that the impact of the academic marks provided by schools appears to be mediated, in part, by their association with parents' perceptions of their children, perhaps through parents' role as interpreters of reality in the construction of children's and adolescents' academic self-concepts. Parents' perceptions of their children's competence can serve as a filter for the adolescents' own competence belief con-structions and, in the end, the development of the children's intrinsic task values. On the one hand, inconsistencies between parents' perceptions and teachers' feedback may confuse students, making the formation of accurate ability self-concepts more difficult. Thus, a cooperation of parents and schools that provides parents with the information needed to build accurate beliefs about their child's academic competences is called for. Direct teacher feedback for the parents on their children's achievement might increase accuracy. On the other hand, positive information from one of these two sources may help to protect students' ability self-concepts from negative feedback from the other source. This compensatory effect might be particularly important in cases where teachers stereotype students and base their grading and their teaching practices accordingly.",

Each of these scholars has shown that parents' stereotypes, causal attributions, and mind sets relate first to the specific ways in which parents interpret their children's academic performances for them and second to the way information and parental support is provided. This possibility is especially important for understanding gender biases in children's self-concepts of their mathematics ability. In both samples, the parents rated their daughters as being better in English than they did their sons at the zero-order correlational level. Coupled with the fact that the only consistent cross-domain association between parents' perceptions and changes in their early adolescents' ability self-concepts occurred for language perceptions to mathematics ability self-concepts, these findings suggest that the competence-related information parents provide is at least partially responsible for the sex difference in their children's mathematics ability self-concepts (e.g., Crowley, Callanan, Tenenbaum, & Allen, 2001; Tenenbaum & Leaper, 2003) . It is interesting to note that no between-parent differences in the effect patterns were found. Thus, the processes seem to be the same for mothers and fathers. If gender differences arise from parental stereotypes, mothers and fathers have to hold similar stereotypes and provide the same information for their offspring. To test this assumption, mixedand same-gender dyads have to be compared in future research to rule out the possibility that the dyad composition moderates these processes.",

The fact that this difference in patterns for mathematics versus language arts occurred in both countries suggests that what is going on is different across these two subject areas. One explanation can be that the definition of what is a correct answer or a successful performance is more objective in mathematics than in language arts. It is likely that grades in mathematics are more directly related to clearly defined performance criteria than are grades in the language arts. This interpretation is supported by the result that both parents' and students' competence perceptions were more closely associated with grades in the mathematics domain than in the verbal domain (for parents, see Dai, 2002; for students, see M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) . It could also be due to the greater focus played in the elementary school years in both countries on reading than on mathematics, perhaps leading to a more stable set of beliefs related to the language arts than to mathematics by the end of Grade 5.",

This was due to the restriction to parallel items in both data sets. Still, the results obtained with the parsimonious indicators were largely comparable to other studies. Thus, we can assume that we have captured the relevant variables to a sufficient extent in both data sets. Second, in the German sample, there was a slight overrepresentation of students attending the college-bound school track. There might be different within-family processes that could influence the results. However, we have controlled for the attended school track in all models. Thus, we can rule out the possibility of school trackrelated third variable effects regarding the reported results. Moreover, the proportion of students attending the higher school track in the sample roughly parallels the proportion in the population in this German federal state. Third, the study is limited to mathematics and English/German language as academic domains. Including more academic domains could increase generalizability of the results of future research. Fourth, the samples used in this study differed in the timing of the secondary school transition. In the U.S. sample, the transition took place between the measurement occasions, while in the German sample the students already attended secondary schools. On the one hand, this fact makes the samples less comparable. On the other hand, it strengthens our claim of general processes, because although the samples are not perfectly comparable, the result patterns are very similar. Fifth, maternal and paternal data in the German data set are not independent. Therefore, mother-father differences have to be referred to the German data set. To draw general conclusions about between-parent differences, data on U.S. fathers would have been needed. Finally, in the reported analyses, concurrent measures of dependent and independent variables ratings were used. We deliberately deviated from the common procedure of cross-lagged modeling as we expected short-term processes to operate. As the premeasurements of the dependent variables were controlled in each analysis, changes in student's perceptions and values were predicted by the independent variables. We suggest interpreting the respective paths in terms of directed effects as specified in our hypotheses. Although this procedure cannot be considered a test of causal effects, it clearly goes beyond cross-sectional approaches to the questions of concern.",

Feedback regarding two academic domains that was obtained in two developmentally important contexts is, in a first step, integrated in early adolescents' academic self-concepts. In a second step, these competence beliefs inform the development of intrinsic task values. Our longitudinal data provided us with the opportunity to interpret our results as directed effects. As comparable effects were shown in two independent samples, we consider our findings as strong evidence for the working of general processes. For further research, it seems appropriate to consider the complex interplay of various sources of information on different academic domains when investigating motivation and achievement in educational settings.

These expected reductions are due to a mediation through the within-domain academic self-concepts (indirect effects: U.S. sample: mathematics: b = .21**; English: b = .15**; German sample: mathematics: b = .47**\\.42**; German: b = .19**\\.14*).",

MA = mathematics domain; LAN = language domain (English and German); PPSC = parental perception of student's competence; SCA = student's self-concept of ability; INVA = student's intrinsic task value. Small within-domain grade effects were found (U.S. sample: mathematics: b = \u00c0.12**; English: b = \u00c0.02; German sample: mathematics: b = \u00c0.12 \\\u00c0.14*; German: b = \u00c0.18*\\\u00c0.18**).

As hypothesized, the predictions by within-domain grades were mediated through the within-domain academic self-concept (indirect effects: U.S. sample: mathematics: b = .11**; English: b = .18**; German sample: mathematics: b = .23** \\.18**; German: b = .24**\\.27**).
