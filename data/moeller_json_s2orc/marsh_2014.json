    "abstract": "In a comprehensive study (15,356 Dutch 9th grade students from 651 classes in 95 schools) we empirically tested the dimensional comparison theory (DCT) propositions formulated by M\u00f6ller & Marsh (2013) as an extension of I/E theory, exploring methodological, theoretical, and substantive insights. According to DCT, academic self-concepts (ASC) are formed in relation to dimensional comparisons in different school subjects, as well as to social and temporal comparisons. In support of DCT predictions, paths from achievement to ASC in matching domains were substantially positive, but paths to non-matching domains (e.g., math achievement to verbal self-concept) were significantly negative. Extending DCT, we show that the more dissimilar the subjects, the more negative the cross paths (far comparisons), whereas cross paths relating more similar subjects (near comparisons) are much less negative and sometimes positive. Extending previous self-concept research and its integration with DCT, we found that positive paths for matching domains and negative paths for non-matching domains were larger for class marks based on classroom performance than for standardized test scores. Controlling for direct measures of social comparison (meVclass ratings of how each student compares to classmates) substantially reduced positive paths from achievement to ASC in matching domains, but also reduced the size of the negative paths from non-matching domains. Supplemental analyses suggest that dimensional comparison processes in both subjective rankings and actual class marks are consistent with those found in ASCs.",

In educational settings, a positive academic self-concept (ASC) is both a highly desirable goal and a means of facilitating subsequent academic achievement, academic accomplishments, and educational choice behaviors such as subject choice, coursework selection, academic persistence, and long-term educational attainment (e.g., Chen, Yeh, Hwang, & Lin, 2013; Guay, Larose, & Boivin, 2004; Marsh, 1991; Pinxten, De Fraine, Van Damme, & D'Haenens, 2010; Parker, Marsh, Ciarrochi, Marshall, & Abduljabbar, 2013) . Theoretical models of ASC formation underscore the importance of frames of reference (Marsh, 2007) : The same objective achievements can lead to highly different self-concepts, depending on the standards of comparison or frames of reference that individuals use to evaluate themselves, and can have important implications for future choices, performance, and behaviors.",

However, in their theoretical founding of dimensional comparison theory (DCT), M\u00f6ller and Marsh (2013) emphasize that: \"Although social comparison (Festinger, 1954) and temporal comparison (Albert, 1977) theories are well established, dimensional comparison is a largely neglected yet influential process in self-evaluation\" (p. 544). DCT (Marsh et al., 2014; M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) incorporates the extensive body of educational psychology research based on the I/E model, placing dimensional comparisons into a broader theoretical foundation in relation to more general psychological models of self-evaluation, person perception, frames of reference, and social comparison.

The theoretical processes posited in the I/E model are that ASC in a particular school subject is formed in relation to an external (social comparison) reference in which students compare their perceptions of their own performances in a particular school subject with the performances of other students in the same school subject, and an internal (dimensional, ipsative comparison) reference in which students compare their own performance in one school subject with their own performances in other school subjects. Thus, students may have a favorable MSC if math is their best subject, even though they are not particularly good at math relative to other students. The joint operation of these theoretical processes, depending on the relative weight given to each, is consistent with the near-zero correlation between MSC and VSC, which led to the revision of the Shavelson, Hubner, and Stanton (1976) multidimensional, hierarchical model of self-concept (see Marsh, 2007) .",

Theoretically, the external comparison process predicts that good math skills lead to higher MSCs and that good verbal skills lead to higher VSCs. According to the internal dimensional comparison process, however, good math skills lead to lower VSCs once the positive effects of good verbal skills are controlled: The better I am at mathematics, the poorer I am at verbal subjects, relative to my good math skills. Similarly, better verbal skills lead to lower MSCs once the positive effects of good math skills are controlled. In models used to test these theoretical predictions (see Fig. 1A ), the horizontal paths leading from math achievement to MSC and from verbal achievement to VSC (matching paths) are predicted to be substantially positive, but the cross paths leading from math achievement to VSC and from verbal achievement to MSC (Fig. 1 ) are predicted to be negative.",

In a meta-analysis of 69 data sets M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, et al. (2009) reported that math and verbal achievements were highly correlated (.67), but self-concepts were nearly uncorrelated (.10). The horizontal paths from achievement to ASC in the matching domains were positive (.61 for math, .49 for verbal), but cross paths were negative from math achievement to VSC (\u2212.21) and verbal achievement to MSC (\u2212.27). Strong support for the generalizability of the I/E predictions led these authors to conclude, \"The results of our meta-analyses indicate that the relations described in the classical I/E model are not restricted to a particular achievement or selfconcept measure or to specific age groups, gender groups, or countries\" (p. 1157), making it one of the most robust empirical findings in educational psychology research.",

Although several I/E studies have considered additional domains (e.g., Bong, 1998; Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2001; Marsh & Yeung, 2001; M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & K\u00f6ller, 2006; Xu et al., 2013) , none of these was based on the new theoretical DCT framework, which incorporates domains other than the math and verbal domains emphasized in the classic I/E model ( Fig. 1B) . Hence, a critically important theoretical contribution of DCT is its expansion of the scope of the theoretical perspective to include a wider variety of domains, in which the cross-paths involve \"near\" and \"far\" comparisons in relation to how similar or dissimilar different school subjects are to each other. This ordering of school subjects along an a priori verbal-to-math continuum is based on theoretical and empirical research that led to the Marsh/Shavelson revision (Marsh, 1990; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) of the original Shavelson et al. (1976) multidimensional, hierarchical model of self-concept (see Marsh, 2007) , thus integrating DCT with established self-concept theory and empirical results. In this theoretical model of the structure of ASC, the ordering of different domains is based on relations among the domains derived from a higher-order factor analysis of the multiple ASC domains ( Fig. 2 ). Of particular relevance to the present investigation, there is a substantial literature showing that ASCs in native and foreign languages are more closely related to each other than to math self-concept (e.g., Xu et al., 2013) .",

In the broader social psychology literature, covering a diversity of domains-mostly not academic in nature-there is also a predominance of contrast effects (e.g., Diener & Fujita, 1997) . Even though some theoretical models in the social psychology literature suggest assimilation effects (e.g., Brickman & Bulman, 1977; Collins, 1996; Tesser, 1988 ; sometimes referred to as positive contextual effects, reflected glory effects, or contagion effects), replicable support for assimilation effects continues to be elusive (Diener & Fujita, 1997; Marsh et al., 2008 Marsh et al., , 2010 . Hence, a critical feature of the expansion of the I/E model into DCT is to highlight this theoretical distinction between near and far comparisons, testing the a priori prediction that contrast effects based on \"near\" comparisons will be substantially less negative and might The 'Classic' Internal/External Frame of Reference (I/E) Model relating verbal and math achievement to verbal and math self-concept. According to predictions from the I/E model, the horizontal paths from achievement to self-concept in the matching domains (content area) are predicted to be substantial and positive, whereas the cross paths from achievement in one domain area to self-concept in a non-matching domain are predicted to be negative (as contrast). B: Extending I/E model to include two closely related verbal domains. Far cross paths (relating math and the two verbal domains) are again predicted to be negative. However, the near cross paths (relating the two verbal domains) are predicted to be significantly less negative, non-significant, or even positive (assimilation). even be positive rather than negative (i.e., assimilation effects). Hence, similar subjects (e.g., native and foreign languages) might be seen as complementary, rather than contrastive, such that achievement in one domain contributes positively to self-concept in a complementary, near domain. This is also important in building bridges between research based on the classic I/E model studied in educational settings, and the more diverse social comparison literature.

Class marks provided by classroom teachers typically are the most immediate and salient source of feedback that students receive about their academic accomplishments, and thus have high ecological validity. However, class marks have idiosyncrasies that complicate their interpretation. For example, teachers tend to grade on a curve, such that the best and worst students in each class tend to get the highest and lowest marks, independently of the average ability levels of students within each class. Furthermore, grading standards and the marking basis of class marks (e.g., various combinations of standardized tests, classroom tests, homework, projects, good behavior, and classroom participation) also tend to be somewhat idiosyncratic to particular subjects and individual teachers. Standardized test scores have the advantage of providing a common metric to evaluate the achievement of all students, independently of their class, teacher, or school. However, typically this is a less immediate, less salient source of feedback to studentsparticularly for low-stakes tests in which students might not even receive feedback about their performance. Although previous selfconcept research has emphasized the importance of this distinction in relation to the size of correlations based on matching areas of achievement and self-concept, here we build upon it by integrating it more fully into DCT.",

This rationale is also consistent with theoretical perspectives from social psychology research on the local dominance effect (Alicke, Zell, & Bloom, 2010; Zell & Alicke, 2009) , in which the most local frame of reference is the most important determinant of self-evaluations. In these social comparison studies of the local dominance effect, in which \"local\" and more \"general\" frames of reference are experimentally manipulated, participants consistently used the most local comparison information available to them, even when they were told that the local comparison was not representative of the broader population and they were provided with more appropriate normative comparison data. Because class marks are more local than test scores, the local dominance effect predicts that class marks should be more related to ASCs. Thus, the rationale from social psychology is complementary to the rationale developed within selfconcept research in educational psychology.",

More specifically, the correlation between math and verbal achievement was substantially larger when based on standardized test scores than on class marks, whereas academic self-concepts were more strongly correlated with achievement in the matching domain when based on teacher-assigned marks rather than standardized tests. However, the meta-analysis results were inherently weak, in that conclusions were necessarily based on different studies that variously considered either class marks or test scores, rather than specifically comparing results for the two indicators of achievement based on the same students in a single, large-scale study. Extending the logic of DCT, we predict that cross-paths based on far comparisons should be more negative when based on class marks than when based on standardized test scores. Although this is not specifically evaluated in the M\u00f6ller et al. (2009) meta-analysis, their results apparently do not support this prediction. However, we again note that their meta-analysis-based largely on studies either of test scores or class marks-is not particularly strong in terms of evaluating differences between test scores and class marks, so that it is relevant to explore further support for this theoretical prediction.",

Our study is based on a large, representative sample of Dutch secondary schools (15,356 9th grade high school students from 651 classes in 95 schools). In the Dutch school system, classes within schools are highly tracked. Students in the high-track classes perform substantially better than students in lower-track classes, when evaluated by achievement measured along a common metric (i.e., standardized tests). Furthermore, the composition of each class is the same for different school subjects, so that students are only exposed to other students of similar abilities who are in the same track. However, class marks in these highly tracked classes depend substantially on how students compare with other students in the same class, whereas standardized tests rank all students in relation to a common metric that is independent of the class, track and school. Hence, the distinction between class marks and standardized test scores is stronger and more clearly defined in the Dutch system than is typical in previous research on this topic. Following from our integration of this previous research into DCT, we hypothesize that:",

They provided strong empirical support for their theoretical tenet that meVclass ratings are a pure indicator of social comparison processes, for the construct validity of meVclass ratings, and for the claim that their research was the first empirical demonstration that negative contextual effects associated with class-average ability were actually due to social comparison processes. In the present investigation, we extend this work by incorporating meVclass ratings in specific school subjects and integrating them into DCT, to provide new tests of the distinction between social and dimensional comparison processes. In particular, we argue that by controlling for meVclass ratings, we are controlling for all or most of the social comparison effects, thereby isolating the dimensional comparison effects and substantially unconfounding the otherwise confounded effect of social and dimensional comparison effects.

The Dutch secondary system has five different tracks, which differ in difficulty level, duration, content, and admission rights for further education. The lowest three tracks are classed together as prevocational education (basic track, middle track, theoretical track) and include four years of schooling, after which these students typically follow senior vocational education. The next track is senior general secondary education and includes five years of schooling, which qualifies students for higher professional education. The highest track is pre-university education, which takes six years, after which students qualify for university. Placement in the first year of secondary education is determined largely by the score on a standardized test taken at the end of primary school (students aged 11 or 12), based on language, arithmetic/mathematics, and learning skills, and by recommendations from primary school teachers. Given the test score and recommendations, the children and their parents select a secondary school. Although many schools have mixedability classes in the first year of high school, by the third year (the basis of the present investigation) almost all classes contain students from a single track. Moreover, the class-the group of students sitting in the same classroom-is the same for different school subjects. Because student class composition is the same for all school subjects, it greatly facilitates evaluations of contextual predictive effects, as the composition of classmates (and thus, the frame of reference) does not vary for different school subjects (e.g., Seaton et al., 2008) .",

Based on data in the present investigation, the coefficient alpha estimates of reliability for each of these three item scales were: .77, Dutch; .86, mathematics, .83, English.

These data were collected during the first half of 2011. All secondary schools were informed about the COOL project and the probability that they would be asked to participate. The initial sample of secondary schools was designed to maximize inclusion of the number of students who had previously been involved in a related study, made when these students were in primary schools, but also their new classmates. Some schools only agreed to collect data from students who had been in the previous study, or for a sample of students. However, in many schools-those considered in the present investigation-all students who were in attendance on the day of data collections, in all classes in the year group, participated, although a small number of individual students or their parents had refused participation. There is also a missing-by-design issue in that, while at all schools, all students completed Dutch and mathematics tests, schools could choose to take English language or civics or both. However, class marks, meVclass ratings, and ASC responses were collected for all students in Dutch, mathematics, and English.",

The critical advantage of this procedure is that the average values are based on results of appropriate latent variable models; model-based, more appropriate standard errors for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests can then be obtained by applying the multivariate delta method (see Raykov & Marcoulides, 2004 , for an accessible introduction).",

Thus, the ASC factors are remarkably distinct, in comparison to correlations among the corresponding class marks (Mn r = .259, SE = .010) and particularly the test scores (Mn r = .539), which were all positive.

This pattern of results, the extreme domain specificity of ASCs in different school subjects in relation to each other and to measures of achievement, and the substantially higher correlations with class marks than with test scores, is consistent with previous research and with a priori predictions (e.g., Marsh, 2007 ; also see earlier discussion). The results provide strong support for both the convergent and discriminant validity of the ASC responses. It is also interesting to note that support for the domain specificity of the class marks, and particularly for the test scores in different school subjects, is much weaker than for ASCs.

Although this academic continuum is posited in relation to ASCs rather than to achievement measures, it is interesting to note that the same pattern of differences is also evident in correlations among the class marks, even though all the correlations are positive. However, correlations among the three test scores are all similar (.519 to .574), and not even the direction of the small differences is consistent with our near and far distinction.

They are important in testing processes underlying the I/E model, but are also of interest in their own right. Consistent with a priori predictions and the discriminant validity of meVclass ratings, the global meVclass ratings are substantially less correlated with achievement and ASC measures than with the domainspecific meVclass rating in the matching domain. Indeed, the domain specificity-both the size and pattern-of the meVclass ratings is surprisingly similar to those observed for the ASC factors (Mn r = .030, SE = .007). Furthermore, the correlations between these singleitem meVclass ratings and matching latent ASC factors are very high (r = .706 to .854, Table 1 ; Mn r = .795). There is also support for the convergent and discriminant validity of the meVclass ratings in relation to test scores (Mn r = .272, SE = .010), and particularly to school marks (Mn r = .587, SE = .006). However, the extreme domain specificity of the meVclass ratings also leads to the rejection of our prediction that intercorrelations among the meVclass ratings would be substantially greater than intercorrelations among ASC factors, and more similar to intercorrelations among the corresponding test scores. Although correlations among meVclass ratings are significantly larger than those among the ASC factors (Mn r = \u2212.043, Note: Correlations are based on Model CFA3, described in more detail in the Supplemental Materials. Self-concepts in the three subjects are latent variable factors based on multiple indicators (see factor loadings in Supplemental Materials) while all other variables are manifest variables based on single indicators. Comparison ratings are based on student ratings of how they compare with other students in their class in each subject, and globally (meVclass). SE = .007), the differences are small, and they are substantially less than intercorrelations among class marks (Mn r = .229, SE =.010).",

In traditional I/E models, the focus is on verbal (native-language) and math constructs. In all five models summarized in Table 3 , there is clear support for the traditional I/E model ( Fig. 1A) based on math and verbal (Dutch) constructs. In particular, the horizontal paths relating predictors to matching ASCs (i.e., math predictors to MSC, Dutch predictors to DSC) are substantially positive, while the cross-paths relating predictors to nonmatching ASCs (i.e., math predictors to DSC, Dutch predictors to MSC) are significantly negative. Although they are clearly supportive of the traditional I/E predictions, these results are not surprising, given the substantial body of support for these predictions.

In this model, the horizontal paths are very large (Mn = .781, SE = .009), far cross-paths are significantly negative (Mn = -.072, SE .006), and the mean of the near cross-paths is not statistically significant (Mn = .000, SE = .006).

In interpreting these results, it is important to emphasize that the teachers for each subject were different, so that the process is unlikely to be the result of strategies used by individual teachers in assigning class marks. Rather, we interpret the results to be a function of student strategies. Thus, we conjecture that students are more motivated, more conscientious, and put in more effort in those subjects in which they feel more competent. At least in the short term, these psychological processes are likely to have more influence on class marks assigned by teachers on the basis of classroom performance, than on low-stakes standardized tests that have no direct implications for the students.

Here we briefly evaluate how the effects change when additional background/demographic variables are included as covariates (Model 4A in Table 5 ): academic track, gender, age, SES, and ethnicity (Western vs. non-Western). The only coefficients to change in terms of statistical significance or direction were the two near paths from English Test to Dutch Self-concept (\u2212.001 SE = .015 in Model 4 to .032 SE = .016 in Model 4A, Table 5 ) and Dutch Test to English Self-concept (.021 SE = .011 in Model 4 to .090 SE = .011 in Model 4A, Table 3 ). Hence, in both cases these small differences associated with the inclusion of these covariates are in the direction of a priori predictions. Other changes are that the positive effects of test scores on ASCs in the matching area became more positive. In summary, inclusion of additional covariates had little effect on support for DCT and led to marginally stronger support for the distinction between near and far paths.",

The effects of age and SES were non-significant for all three domains. Although gender differences were small, girls scored significantly lower on all three self-concepts, but less so for Dutch selfconcepts. Interestingly, students with parents born in a non-Western country scored slightly higher than those of students with parents from a Western country. This is consistent with the wellestablished \"immigrant paradox\", in which immigrant students show better adaptation outcomes than their native-born counterparts (Fuligni, 1998; OECD, 2006; Sam & Berry, 2010) as demonstrated in previous Dutch research (van Geel & Vedder, 2010) . However, the strongest effect of these background demographic variables is the negative effect of being in a higher academic track after controlling for individual student characteristics. This negative contextual effect is consistent with the well-established \"big-fish-littlepond\" effect (e.g., Marsh & Hau, 2003; Marsh et al., 2008; Nagengast & Marsh, 2012) in which students tend to have lower ASCs when they are in schools and classes in which the average achievement levels are higher than equally able students in schools and classes where the average achievement levels are lower. Hence, although further analyses of the effects of these covariates are beyond the scope of the present investigation, the effects are largely consistent with previous research. In summary, comparison of Models 4 and 4A (Table 5) demonstrates that support for DCT predictions is little affected by-or is even slightly stronger with-the inclusion of these covariates.",

Indeed, a critical source of selfknowledge is knowing one's relative strengths and weaknesses in different domains, since this is the basis of many future academic choices, and influences competing strategies such as accurate selfevaluation, self-improvement, self-maintenance, and selfenhancement. The I/E model that underpins DCT is based mostly on how math and verbal achievements are related to MSC and VSC Table 5 Five models predicting three academic self-concept factors (Dutch, English, and Math) based on alternative sets of predictor variables: standardized path coefficients as a ratio of standard errors relating achievement measures to ASC factors (Dutch, English, Math).",

Grounded on an impressive array of correlational, longitudinal, cross-cultural, experimental, and qualitative studies, there is clear support for theoretical predictions that better math achievement leads to lower VSCs and that better verbal achievement leads to lower MSCs-the critical, seemingly paradoxical prediction of the I/E model. In the present investigation, we explore new methodological, theoretical, and substantive insights into the extension of the I/E model into DCT. Within a traditional construct validity perspective, it is typical to distinguish between convergent and discriminant validity. In validating ASCs in relation to achievement, convergent validity is represented by the horizontal paths in the I/E model (Fig. 1) , whereas discriminant validity is related to the cross paths. In this respect, our results show that support for both the convergent and the discriminant validity of ASCs is stronger in relation to class marks than to standardized test scores. Using this same logic in reverse, it is also possible to argue that support for the convergent and discriminant validity of achievement measures is stronger for class marks than for test scores-at least in relation to ASCs. This is also evident in that correlations among the standardized test scores (.523 to .574) are much higher and less differentiated than correlations among the class marks (.157 to .335). Indeed, test scores are only modestly correlated with class marks (Mn r = .272) and no more highly correlated with class marks than ASCs (Mn r = .296). Thus, it is not surprising that the predictive validity of test scores dropped substantially when class marks were included in the prediction of ASCs (e.g., Model 4 in Tables 3 and 4 ). These results are consistent with our a priori predictions based on previous research, showing that class marks are more highly correlated with ASCs than test scores. Thus, class marks are a more \"locally dominant\" indicator of achievement, a more direct measure of achievement, and also more responsive to the motivational influences that it shares with ASC. Based on our findings, we argue that future DCT research-and educational research more generally-should more fully differentiate between class marks and standardized test scores as distinct indicators of achievement. In relation to ASC research in particular, class marks are a more useful measure of achievement than are standardized test scores. However, class marks also present greater challenges, in that they tend to be idiosyncratic in relation to specific subjects, individual teachers, and type of assessment (e.g., tests, homework, projects, classroom participation).",

Previous I/E studies have mostly focused on math and verbal domains, maximally dissimilar school subjects in relation to the theoretical continuum of ASCs in Fig. 2 . However, the theoretical basis of the I/E model and its extension to DCT posits that negative cross paths (contrast) associated with maximally dissimilar (far) domains will diminish and may even become positive (assimilation) for maximally similar (near) domains. In the present investigation we operationalized this extension and proposed new statistical tests of these predictions. Consistent with a priori predictions, far cross paths (math compared to English and Dutch) were consistently negative, whereas near cross paths (English compared to Dutch) were consistently much smaller (small positive, non-significant, or small negative). However, more research is needed to develop this extension more fully in relation to a wider array of academic subjects, and to other conditions that may prompt students to contrast or assimilate information from different domains in the formation of ASCs (also see related work on assimilation and contrast in social comparison research; e.g., Huguet et al., 2009; Suls & Wheeler, 2000) . Furthermore, although there is a strong theoretical and empirical basis for this continuum-and support for it in the present investigation-it would be useful to extend this area of research further by asking students to directly rate the perceived similarity between different academic domains. This could be used to vali-date the continuum but also provide more nuanced tests of DCT predictions such that the perceived \"nearness\" or \"farness\" of different domains might influence the size of the observed relations over and above the more objective positioning of constructs on the continuum.",

Extending this innovation, we posited that the use of meVclass ratings would allow us to disentangle social comparison and internal dimensional comparison processes, which are at the heart of DCT. In some respects these meVclass measures worked well, in that these ratings were surprisingly free of response biases; the grand means across all respondents were almost exactly equal to the average response category (see earlier discussion) and meVclass ratings had good convergent and discriminant validity in relation to ASCs, class marks, and test scores. However, empirical tests only partially supported our hypothesis that inclusion of meVclass ratings would substantially reduce or eliminate the horizontal paths that reflect external social comparisons but have little or no effect on cross paths that reflect internal dimensional comparisons. In particular, we found that the horizontal paths were still substantial (even though substantially reduced) and that negative cross paths became less negative (even though the reduction was much smaller than for the horizontal paths). Several features of the meVclass ratings and the supplemental analyses offer further insight into why support was only partial. Of critical importance, correlations among three (Dutch, English, math) meVclass ratings were surprisingly small (Mn r = .030), which leads us to suspect that internal dimensional comparison processes might influence meVclass ratings. Support for this ex post facto supposition comes from a series of models in which meVclass ratings (instead of ASCs) are regressed on measures of achievement. These showed that far cross paths from test scores, and particularly school marks, were significantly negative. These analyses with meVclass ratings as outcomes provide particularly strong support for the generalizability and robustness of a priori DCT predictions, generalizing to measures that would seem not to have even an implicit demand for internal comparisons.",

Because different teachers assigned the class marks in each subject, the result is unlikely to reflect teacher strategies in assigning class marks. Our tentative suggestion is that the internal comparison process has motivational properties that are reflected in the class marks achieved in different school subjects. Thus, students might over-achieve in their relatively best subjects (through some combination of academic choice behavior, greater motivation, effort, and conscientiousness) and under-perform in their relatively worst subjects (through some combination of procrastination, academic choice behavior and reduced motivation, effort, and conscientiousness). We suspect that this explains in part why far cross paths are negative even when meVclass and class marks are the outcome variables (but not when test scores are the outcome-see Model 8). This explanation is also consistent with correlations among the class marks, and particularly among the meVclass ratings, being so much lower than those among the test scores. These speculations, if confirmed by subsequent research, will have important implications for DCT, frame of reference research, and the use of meVclass ratings as a (perhaps) not-so-pure measure of social comparison processes. However, the implications are even more important for understanding student motivation in the pursuit of mastering materials in what they perceive as their best and worst school subjects. Indeed, over time this sort of process could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, much as they are consistent with the results, these are post-hoc speculations requiring further work.",

An obvious direction for further research is expanding the range of achievement domains to be considered. In particular, the inclusion of different science domains is important in terms of increasing emphasis in educational psychology on student development in science and selection of STEM courses. Fundamental to this expansion is the theoretical continuum of academic subjects along the math-toverbal continuum (Fig. 2) . Importantly, this continuum has a strong theoretical and empirical basis in the Marsh/Shavelson multidimensional, hierarchical model of self-concept. Nevertheless, further research is needed as to whether pair-wise differences between the perceived complementarity/antagonism of a whole range of academic domains can be adequately represented by this continuum in relation to DCT (e.g., Goetz et al., 2010 quantified differences between school subjects based on the academic emotions).",

When teachers, parents, and \"significant others\" are asked to infer students' self-concepts (see Dai, 2002; Marsh, 2007; Marsh & Craven, 1997) , the responses apparently reflect the external comparison process mainly, such that inferences are not nearly as domain specific as self-responses by students themselves. The responses of teachers, parents, and others imply that, consistent with corresponding measures of achievement, students who are bright in one area tend to be seen as having good ASCs in all academic areas, whereas students with lower ability in one area are seen as having poor ASCs in all areas. However, if teachers and others better understood the formation of self-concepts in different academic domains, they would be able to understand their students better and provide more appropriate, credible feedback, particularly for less able students. Even bright students might have an average or below-average self-concept in their weakest school subjects; this is somewhat paradoxical, in relation to their good achievement (i.e., relative to other students but not relative to their own performance in other school subjects). In a similar vein, even poor students may have an average or above-average self-concept in their best school subject; this appears paradoxical on the basis of their belowaverage achievement in that subject (an external, social comparison), but not when considered in relation to their other school subjects (an internal, dimensional comparison). In the present investigation we add to these insights the distinction between near and far comparisons. Hence, feedback from teachers and others should particularly reinforce the complementarity of near domains, where accomplishments in one domain might have positive effects in other, similar domains. Teachers should also reinforce the complementarity of accomplishments in a student's best school subject with far school subjects, to undermine the negative contrast effects that undermine self-belief in relation to these subjects.",

Particularly in the present investigation, where classes are highly tracked, these two indicators of achievement are only moderately correlated, so it is clear that class marks and test scores represent distinct constructs. Student self-concepts are substantially more highly correlated with class marks than with test scores, and many previous studies show that self-concepts are highly predictive of students' academic choices, aspirations, and long-term attainment. However, what is new in the present investigation is the finding that high class marks in one subject are even more detrimental to self-concepts in different domains than high test scores, particularly when based on far comparisons. There is also some suggestion that this becomes a selffulfilling prophecy in that, relative to standardized achievement scores, students get better than expected class marks in their best subjects and, perhaps, lower than expected class marks in their weakest subjects. Although these interpretations are still highly speculative and require further research, this interpretation of our results is consistent with dimensional comparison processes, the main focus of the present investigation.",
