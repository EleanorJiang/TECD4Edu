    "abstract": "Students' cognitive and motivational profiles have a large impact on their academic careers. The development of such profiles can partly be explained by the reciprocal internal/external frame of reference model (RI/E model). The RI/E model predicts positive and negative longitudinal effects between academic self-concepts and achievements within and across 2 academic domains (i.e., the mathematics and verbal domains). In the present study, we replicated the RI/E model in 2 samples and extended it by simultaneously investigating the longitudinal associations of academic self-concepts and achievements in 3 academic domains (i.e., mathematics, German as a native language, English as a foreign language). We examined 2 domains across 4 measurement occasions in 2 independent student samples who were in Grades 5-8 (Study 1: N \u03ed 1,529) or Grades 5-7 (Study 2: N \u03ed 639). In a 3rd study, we examined a subsample of the 2nd sample (N \u03ed 465) in 3 domains. Results demonstrated support for the RI/E model for 2 as well as 3 academic domains. We found positive reciprocal effects of academic self-concepts and achievements within a domain, positive reciprocal effects between achievements across domains, negative effects of achievements on subsequent cross-domain self-concepts, negative effects of academic self-concepts on subsequent cross-domain achievements, and some support for negative effects of academic self-concepts on subsequent cross-domain self-concepts. Furthermore, we found that RI/E model effects were of comparable size across time. To conclude, the RI/E model provides significant insights into the development of distinct motivational and cognitive profiles and, thus, of becoming either a math or verbal person. Implications for research and educational practice are discussed.",

                "text": "Most previous research on academic self-concepts has concentrated on the mutual relations between academic self-concepts and academic achievements (e.g., Huang, 2011) . More specifically, an ever-growing body of (a) longitudinal research on reciprocal and mutually reinforcing effects between academic self-concepts and academic achievements within a single academic domain (i.e., reciprocal effects model [REM] ) has been accompanied by a growing body of (b) cross-sectional research on the internal/ external frame of reference model (I/E model) that predicts (among others) negative contrast effects of achievement in one domain (e.g., mathematics) on academic self-concept in another domain (e.g., German as a verbal subject). Importantly, these two models were typically studied in isolation until M\u00f6ller, Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, and Marsh (2011) presented their pioneering work. In their study, M\u00f6ller et al. integrated the two models in the reciprocal internal/external frame of reference model (RI/E model) to simul-taneously examine (a) reciprocal effects and (b) contrast effects between academic self-concepts and achievements in different academic domains in the long run. Of note, by considering the development of academic self-concept and achievement within and across different academic domains, the RI/E model provides insights into the joint development of students' cognitive and motivational profiles. Thus, the RI/E model is important for promoting a better understanding of the developmental tasks and academic trajectories that depend on such profiles. This involves forming one's self, selecting specialized courses, or deciding on a career choice.",

                "text": "Given its immanent importance for educational theory, research, and practice, further research on the RI/E model is necessary. To date, however, there have been no replications of the RI/E model. Furthermore, some predictions derived from the RI/E model need to be subjected to empirical scrutiny. Notably, the potential negative long-term effect of academic self-concept on cross-domain achievement needs further clarification (see next paragraph). The present study therefore aimed to further empirically examine the RI/E model by analyzing the mutual longitudinal relations between achievements and self-concepts in mathematics and German (as a verbal subject). Importantly, to carefully explore the generalizability of the RI/E model, we analyzed two large independent samples of data that both included four waves of data collection: Study 1 included Grades 5 to 8, and Study 2 included Grades 5 to 7. Capitalizing on this broad empirical data base, we were also able to extend the RI/E model by simultaneously investigating academic self-concepts and achievements in mathematics and a native (i.e., German) as well as a foreign (i.e., English) language. This significant extension of the RI/E model across three different academic domains has not been conducted before. Additionally, we were interested in the question of whether the strengths of the relations between academic self-concepts and achievements differ in different phases of students' school careers (e.g., new learning groups in the first months of secondary school vs. stable learning groups in higher grades). If yes, this would indicate phasedependent developmental differences in students' formation of cognitive and motivational profiles. To our knowledge, this question had not been investigated yet.",

Thus, high achievement in one domain (e.g., mathematics achievement) is assumed to exert a negative influence on academic self-concept in a contrasting domain (e.g., verbal self-concept). This internal frame of reference effect thus describes dimensional comparison effects (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013 ; see also Marsh, 2006; M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001a; . Of note, most research on the I/E model has drawn on cross-sectional data (e.g., Marsh, 2006; M\u00f6ller et al., 2009) and has not tested the predictions longitudinally (see Brunner et al., 2010, for an exception) .",

Furthermore, they should even hold after controlling for baseline measures within and across the verbal and mathematics domains (i.e., achievements and academic self-concepts)-going beyond conventional REM and I/E model research (M\u00f6ller et al., 2011) . Figure 1 presents all assumptions of the RI/E model (M\u00f6ller et al., 2011) . As is true for the REM and I/E models, the RI/E model predicts (a) skill development effects (indicated by \u2423), (b) self-enhancement effects (indicated by \u2424), (c) autoregressive effects (indicated by \u03b5), and (d) internal frame of reference effects (indicated by \u2425). Furthermore, by extending the rationale of the I/E model longitudinally, the RI/E model predicts (e) positive cross-domain effects of achievements on subsequent achievements in the contrasting domain (i.e., positive reciprocal cross-domain effects between achievements; indicated by ) and (f) weak or null effects of academic self-concepts on subsequent noncorresponding self-concepts across domains (i.e., the prior verbal self-concept only marginally or does not affect the subsequent mathematics self-concept and vice versa; indicated by ). However, a new prediction emerges by combining the REM with the I/E model: (g) Prior academic self-concept should negatively affect subsequent achievement in the contrasting domain (e.g., mathematics selfconcept should negatively affect subsequent German achievement) when prior achievements are controlled for (indicated by \u2426 in Figure 1 ). Such negative cross-domain contrast effects of academic self-concepts have been neglected in academic self-concept research to date. Prior academic self-concept research has focused almost exclusively on the positive effects of academic self-concept (e.g., Marsh & Martin, 2011) , considering self-concept to be \"a negative cross-domain contrast effects of academic self-concepts by suggesting either null relations or very small negative effects of academic self-concept in one domain on achievement in another domain.",

Overall, findings supported the seven core predictions of the RI/E model (as mentioned above). Yet, compared to other postulated effects, support for negative effects of academic self-concepts on subsequent achievements across domains (i.e., cross-domain contrast effects of academic self-concepts) was considerably weaker: M\u00f6ller et al. found only indirect support for negative cross-domain contrast effects of academic self-concepts. Although none of these effects reached statistical significance (at p \u03fd .05), restricting the corresponding paths to zero resulted in significant decreases in model fit (i.e., for chi-square difference testing via model comparison). In sum, these results point to the need for more research on this effect in particular and on the RI/E model in general. To date, the model has not been replicated.",

However, I/E model research juxtaposing two domains that are typically perceived as closely related-such as two verbal domains (i.e., German and English) or two numerical or science domains (i.e., mathematics and physics)-has delivered rather mixed results. For example, M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, and K\u00f6ller (2006) extended the I/E model to two verbal and two science domains (i.e., mathematics, physics, German, and English). They identified positive cross-sectional correlations between English achievement and German self-concept, between mathematics achievement and physics self-concept, and between physics achievement and mathematics self-concept, respectively. In line with this, Xu et al. (2013) recently found no internal frame of reference effects among the native (i.e., Chinese) and foreign (i.e., English) languages of students, but they found negative contrast effects of mathematics achievement on Chinese and English selfconcepts. In addition, Chinese and English achievements were negatively related to mathematics self-concept. By contrast, Chiu (2012) found negative internal frame of reference effects between mathematics and science. Of note, all of these findings are based on crosssectional data. For longitudinal data, Brunner et al. (2010) reported negative longitudinal internal frame of reference effects from Grades 6 to 8 between French and German as verbal subjects in a Luxembourgish sample (of note, both languages are vital in Luxembourg; see Brunner et al., 2010 , for a discussion). Taken together, more longitudinal research on internal frame of reference effects between closely related domains is needed.",

One could assume that the impact of academic self-concepts on corresponding achievements (i.e., self-enhancement effects) increases during transition periods such as when students enter secondary school and, therewith, when they enter a new learning environment in which they have to cope with uncertainty regarding their academic standing (Preckel, G\u00f6tz, & Frenzel, 2010; Wagner, 2001 ). On the other hand, skill development effects may be more powerful in learning environments that are perceived as rather stable (Helmke, 1992) . By examining students from the beginning of secondary school (i.e., Grade 5) to Grade 8 (Study 1) and from the beginning of Grade 5 to Grade 7 (Study 2), we were able to test potential developmental differences in the strength of selfenhancement and skill development effects-and the other effects postulated by the RI/E model. Variations in the magnitudes of the observed effects over time could indicate that these developmental processes depend on phases in secondary school during which the students' learning environment becomes increasingly stable across time. In the methodological literature, the stability of effects is called stationarity (Kenny, 1975; T. D. Little, Preacher, Selig, & Card, 2007) . In the present study, we examined the stationarity of RI/E model effects in an important transition phase within students' educational careers. To our knowledge, this has never been done before.",

Bonett (2012) stated, \"replication evidence is the gold standard by which scientific claims are evaluated\" (p. 410), yet only about 1% of psychology publications are actually replications (Makel, Plucker, & Hegarty, 2012 ; for further arguments on the importance of replications, see, e.g., Pashler & Harris, 2012) . Accordingly, our first important research aim was to replicate the RI/E model because the RI/E model has not been replicated to date. Second, we aimed to significantly extend the RI/E model in two directions: (a) We investigated not only the domains of mathematics and native language but also a domain that is closely related to the latter-that is, English as a foreign language (replication-extension study; Bonett, 2012) . (b)This study is the first to analyze the temporal stability of RI/E model predictions across time. To these ends, we conducted three studies that capitalized on large data sets from two independent samples of German secondary school students.",

We were also able to broaden the empirical body of RI/E model research by considering more points of measurement (see, e.g., Bonett, 2012; Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2001 ). First, to complement M\u00f6ller and colleagues' (2011) sample, which comprised students from different types of secondary schools, Studies 1 to 3 in the present study focused only on students attending the top track of the highly selective German secondary school system (i.e., the German Gymnasium). In comparison to the other scholastic tracks, the Gymnasium differs with respect to school quality and learning environment such that instruction in the Gymnasium is more cognitively demanding and activating (Becker, L\u00fcdtke, Trautwein, K\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 2012) . We examined the generalizability of the RI/E model by focusing on a selected subgroup of secondary school students to learn whether the effects found for a heterogeneous sample of the German student body would also hold for students in the Gymnasium, who comprise a more homogeneous subgroup (differences in results would indicate a moderation effect due to specific demographic features of this subgroup). Second, Study 1 on the one hand and Studies 2 and 3 on the other hand varied in their time lags with regard to when performance feedback was given and when academic self-concepts were assessed (differences in results would indicate an effect of time-lag length). Third, M\u00f6ller et al. examined a panel study with three waves of measurement, whereas all of the three studies in the present article contained four waves of measurement.",

Students reported their grades shortly after they received their midterm reports at Times 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Although meta-analytic research suggests that self-reported grades can be positively biased to a certain extent (Kuncel, Cred\u00e9, & Thomas, 2005) , recent research from Germanspeaking countries has demonstrated that self-reported school grades are not subject to systematic reporting biases (Dickh\u00e4user & Plenter, 2005) . Hence, these self-reported grades can be considered to represent reliable and valid indicators of students' mathematics and German achievements, respectively. In Germany, a 6-point grading system is used.

Little et al., 2007) . Herein, academic self-concepts were specified as latent variables with three indicators each, and academic achievements (i.e., midterm records in mathematics and German) were modeled as manifest single-indicator variables. For the latent variables, we allowed the residuals of corresponding indicators to correlate across the points of measurement (i.e., correlated uniquenesses; T. D. Little et al., 2007) . Figure 2 illustrates the resulting SEM. Hence, we investigated our research aims by considering three subsequent time spans: (a) the time span of approximately 4 months from the beginning of secondary school in the fifth grade (i.e., Time 1) to the beginning of the second semester of the fifth grade (i.e., Time 2), (b) the time span of 1 year from the beginning of the second semester of the fifth grade (i.e., Time 2) to the beginning of the second semester of the sixth grade (i.e., Time 3), and (c) the time span of 2 years from the beginning of the second semester of the sixth grade (i.e., Time 3) to the beginning of the second semester of the eighth grade (i.e., Time 4). Note that these observed time intervals were not of the same length. Because the magnitudes of the coefficients' absolute values will shift as the lags become shorter or longer, the observed magnitudes of the path coefficients were not directly comparable across these three time spans (Oud & Delsing, 2010) . However, the recorded midterm grades were always provided to the students about 2 weeks before they answered the questionnaire on academic self-concepts. Thus, these lags were of comparable length. Figure 2 illustrates corresponding paths of comparable length by identical letters. Accordingly, the panel design applied in Study 1 allowed us to compare the magnitude and, therewith, test the stability (i.e., stationarity; Kenny, 1975) of (a) skill development effects and (b) internal frame of reference effects. To test the assumption of stationarity, we set all corresponding paths to equality across time (as presented in Figure 2 ; i.e., all a paths, b paths, c paths, and d paths, respectively). This approach enabled us to explore whether skill development effects and internal frame of reference effects changed across time. The tenability of the equality constraints could be tested via nested model comparisons (T. D. Little et al., 2007) .",

Table 3 presents the model fit statistics; all models had acceptable to good fit. However, the first b path (i.e., from fifth-grade mathematics achievement to the subsequent mathematics self-concept at Time 2) was significantly different in magnitude than the second and third b paths, which, for their part, showed similar magnitudes across time and were, therefore, set equal (see Table 3 ). This indicates that skill development effects (i.e., the b and d paths) were similar in size over time except for the first b path (i.e., within the domain of mathematics). Furthermore, all internal frame of reference effects (i.e., the a and c paths) fit the assumption of stationarity across time.

By contrast, two of the three tested paths between prior English achievements and subsequent German self-concepts were negative and significant. The same applied for the longitudinal relations between prior German achievements and subsequent mathematics self-concepts. Again, two of the three tested paths were negative and significant. Concerning the internal frame of reference paths between German achievements and subsequent English self-concepts, the results were not consistent across time: In the first two time slots, the associations were significant and negative; in the third time slot, however, this association was significant and positive. In sum, the results provide some support for longitudinal internal frame of reference effects across one numeric and two verbal domains. All but one of the seven significant paths were found to be negative.",

As students' academic self-concept is strongly related to motivational and affective variables (e.g., interest, academic emotions) and behavioral outcomes (e.g., course selection), academic self-concept is one key variable in educational research. More holistic than conventional self-concept models (e.g., the REM or the I/E model), the RI/E model reflects the joint development of students' motivational (i.e., self-concept) and cognitive (i.e., achievement) profiles by modeling positive reciprocal and negative contrast effects across time-thereby considerably advancing self-concept research.",

Accordingly, our first research aim was the replication of the RI/E model to thereby probe its generalizability. In addition, our second research aim was to significantly extend the RI/E model by examining its predictions across more than two academic domains (i.e., replication-extension study; see Bonett, 2012) and to test whether corresponding empirical relations would be stable across time (stationarity). Overall, our results supported the RI/E model framework. We found evidence for both positive reciprocal effects and negative contrast effects of academic self-concepts and achievements in the long run. Concerning the generalizability of the RI/E model across independent samples, the resulting patterns of longitudinal associations were remarkably similar between Studies 1 and 2. Furthermore, the RI/E model predictions held across the academic domains investigated (i.e., across the domains of mathematics and German, mathematics and English, or German and English; see Study 3). Additionally, for the examined time span in secondary school, we found that the tested RI/E model effects were stable across time. Of note, M\u00f6ller and colleagues (2011) examined students in secondary school as a whole, whereas we tested the RI/E model framework by focusing on students in the top track of the German secondary school system (i.e., German Gymnasium). Only by controlling for between-secondary-school differences can researchers investigate whether the psychological processes depicted in the RI/E model occur in all subgroups (i.e., certain secondary school types). By focusing on one track, we were therefore able to test the generalizability of the RI/E model framework for this selected group (cf. Shadish et al., 2001 , for quasi-experimental designs to generalize causal inferences).",

Notably, we found support for contrasting internal frame of reference effects between the two verbal domains German and English. Herein, we found five of six tested paths to be significant; all but one were negative. Thus, students seem to contrast their grades in German or English with their self-perceived ability in the other verbal subject. These results are of particular interest because the appearance of longitudinal contrast effects between two verbal domains has been repeatedly doubted in favor of positive assimilation effects (M\u00f6ller et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2013 ; see the introduction; see also M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) . We found no evidence for positive long-lasting effects of verbal self-concepts on cross-domain verbal achievements or vice versa. In addition, the internal frame of reference effects between the domains of mathematics and English did not reach statistical significance. After controlling for five concurrent internal frame of reference paths per examined time span, effects might be too weak to reach significance (see limitations below). Between mathematics and German, five out of six internal frame of reference paths were negative; two of them reached statistical significance. Of note, Studies 1 and 2-which could more reliably detect smaller effects (see section on limitations)-revealed internal frame of reference effects between mathematics and German more consistently. However, we found further evidence for negative cross-domain contrast effects of academic self-concepts: Mathematics self-concept was consistently negatively related to subsequent English achievement. Similarly, mathematics selfconcept was significantly negatively related to subsequent German achievement (after controlling for baseline measures; cf. Studies 1 and 2). Additionally, we found a negative and significant direct path between mathematics self-concept and subsequent English self-concept (after controlling for baseline measures; without controlling for shared variances, German self-concept was found to be positively related to subsequent English self-concept).",

However, because we did not replicate this finding in the second sample (i.e., Studies 2 and 3), we have no evidence to generalize it. Thus, we did not interpret this single path any further. Taken together, we found no evidence for variations in the strength of (a) positive skill development effects or (b) negative internal frame of reference effects (i.e., Studies 1, 2, and 3). Furthermore, our findings suggest stability in the relative strengths of these RI/E model effects across time (i.e., Studies 2 and 3): (c) positive self-enhancement effects, (d) negative cross-domain contrast effects of academic self-concepts, (e) positive autoregressive effects (for achievements), and (f) positive reciprocal cross-domain effects between achievements. To conclude, there seem to be no phase-dependent variations in the strengths of the associations between academic self-concepts and achievements (or between adjacent achievements) across time.

Such integrative models have several advantages for the examination of academic self-concept development compared with models that consider only the mutual relation between (global or one specific facet of) academic self-concept and achievement. Notably, numerous longitudinal relations can be investigated while controlling for shared variances. Besides methodological advantages, more integrative models also feature conceptual advantages: RI/E model research offers genuine and novel insights into the dynamics of students' motivational and cognitive profile formation-also in hinting at academic self-concept's dark side, which has been largely neglected in prior research (see the introduction). Of note, more integrative models are also more complex models. In Study 3, we investigated three domains. Here, statistical power might be an issue for two reasons. First, in Study 3, we used a subsample of Study 2. Thus, as a consequence, we estimated the more complex model in Study 3 with a smaller sample than we did for the less complex model in Study 2. Therefore, Study 3 had less statistical power to estimate the single RI/E model predictions, resulting in a more conservative test than in Studies 1 and 2. Second, the power was further restricted by the fact that we did not have complete data for all students at any time of measurement (power was considerably less of an issue in Studies 1 and 2, where more data were available to estimate the single RI/E model predictions). Thus, Study 3 offered less reliable tests to detect smaller effects. Nevertheless, all RI/E model estimates were properly estimated in Study 3 and were-above all-in line with the RI/E model predictions.",

In fact, the RI/E model provides important insights into the underlying mechanisms of becoming a math or verbal person-or even more subject-specifically, for example, a person who has good native language skills or is good at learning foreign languages. In particular, the RI/E model accentuates the propulsive role of academic self-concepts in developing distinct motivational and cognitive profiles. Whereas students' academic attainment for its own sake seems to benefit further attainment even in noncorresponding domains, academic self-concepts seem to strengthen achievement in corresponding domains but simultaneously weaken those in domains that are assumed to contrast with each other. Furthermore, we found some support that academic self-concepts are directly and negatively longitudinally related to cross-domain self-concepts. This, in turn, would additionally stimulate students' profile formation. Taken together, thinking of oneself as being either a math or verbal person seems to enhance future corresponding achievements, but-at the same time-it also seems to weaken future noncorresponding achievements and selfconcepts (at least indirectly).",

Hence, academic self-concepts probably benefit niche-picking processes wherein students actively choose selfcongruent environments (i.e., environments that fit their personalities; Caspi, Roberts, & Shiner, 2005) . Thus, the RI/E model framework might also be viewed as a promising heuristic for counseling. According to Eccles's (1994) expectancy-value model of educational and occupational choices, peoples' career choices mainly depend on a function of perceptions of task values and expectations for success, wherein the latter are modeled by academic self-concepts. Thus, the RI/E model can substantially refine central facets of Eccles's model by shedding light on underlying developmental dynamics of academic self-concepts in contrasting domains. Other models reflecting academic profiles have also considered cognitive ability (see, e.g., Lubinski & Benbow, 2000) . Herein, understanding RI/E model dynamics should help researchers to better understand the gaps between students' actual and perceived abilities.",

Thus, an examination of the RI/E model that takes into consideration further cognitive variables (e.g., domainspecific ability), variables of perceived task value (e.g., academic interest), and attribution styles (e.g., performing well in mathematics and German as a result of ability or of effort) would more completely depict the process of self-regulation in educational contexts. Additionally, potential mediators of the longitudinal relations among academic self-concepts and achievements should be investigated. In fact, the underlying modes of action of the influence of academic self-concept on achievements are still unclear to some extent (M\u00f6ller et al., 2011) . A plausible explanation would be that high domain-specific academic self-concepts result in more engagement and time invested in corresponding academic domains (Marsh & Yeung, 1997; M\u00f6ller et al., 2011) . In fact, some research supports these predictions (see Trautwein & L\u00fcdtke, 2007; Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, Roberts, Schnyder, & Niggli, 2009) . Certainly, there is a need to more rigorously examine the potential mediators of the longitudinal relations between academic self-concepts and achievements (Marsh, 2006) . At any rate, over and above feedback regarding one's own actual achievements, academic self-concepts seem to influence students' perceptions of their learning environment and, thus, their overall engagement in learning opportunities.",

Marsh and colleagues (2005) already integrated academic interests into the REM model framework. However, an integration of academic interest (and/or further cognitive/affective variables as mediators or moderators) in the more holistic RI/E model framework still remains to be implemented. A practical implication of the present study clearly concerns the question of how students can be made to feel good about themselves in several academic domains at the same time. Metaanalytical research on self-concept interventions revealed that interventions focusing on praise and/or feedback yielded the highest effect sizes (d \u03ed 1.13; O'Mara, Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 2006) . Herein, the robustness of RI/E model principles (i.e., across time and different domains) clarifies the importance of providing comprehensible and appreciative performance feedback to students (cf. Marsh & Hau, 2004) . Furthermore, the RI/E model framework helps us to understand why even students who have a lot of potential in several domains may develop a below-average academic self-concept in one particular domain (cf. Marsh & Hau, 2004) and may even become domain-specific underachievers (cf. Snyder & Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2013) . Herein, we shed light on the need to simultaneously consider both students' achievements and academic self-concepts in different domains. Maybe more inclusive instructional strategies can help to substantially reduce the negative contrast effects that result in the disadvantage of particular academic domains in the long term, for example, combining elements from different academic domains in instruction (e.g., occasionally teaching mathematics in foreign languages or broaching the issue of radiocarbon age determination in history classes). Such inclusive strategies would emphasize the commonalities between academic fields instead of contrasting supposedly independent academic field skills. Of course, this assumption is speculative in nature and needs to be empirically tested. By presenting our findings, we hope to stimulate further research in this area.",
