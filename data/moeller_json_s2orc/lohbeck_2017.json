    "abstract": "The big-fish-little-pond model (BFLP) and the internal/external (I/E) frame of reference model highlight the great influence of social and dimensional comparison effects on academic self-concepts (ASCs). In the present study of 291 elementary school children in Grade 2, both models were tested in a unifying framework based on math and reading self-concepts and achievements. The aim was to test the BFLP model, the I/E model, and the revisited I/E model integrating both the predictions of the BFLP model and the I/E model. Results showed significantly positive within-domain achievement-self-concept relations, but no significantly negative cross-domain achievementself-concept relations. Moreover, there were higher relations between individual achievements than between ASCs, while no support was found for positive compensatory effects of class-average achievements on ASCs. The within and cross-domain effects were generally smaller than the ones reported for older students. This research indicates that social and dimensional comparison effects on ASCs are of less importance in second graders.",

A substantial body of studies has cross-culturally confirmed the robustness of the BFLPE in various academic domains (i.e., Dijkstra, Kuyper, van der Werf, Buunk, & van der Zee, 2008; Trautwein, Gerlach, & L\u00fcdtke, 2008) , even in younger age groups such as elementary school children (i.e., Arens & Watermann, 2015; Roy et al., 2015; Szumski & Karwowski, 2015; Wouters et al., 2015) . For instance, using a series of three studies, Szumski and Karwowksi (2015) investigated the moderators of the BFLPE among ten-year-old students with and without intellectual disability in Poland. Results provided support for the BFLPE and its moderation by emotional and social integration as the BFLPE was stronger in students who were highly socially integrated with peers, but poorly emotionally integrated into school. In addition, many studies have examined the BFLPE just before transition to secondary school, respectively (i.e., Arens & Watermann, 2015; Arens, Yeung, Craven, Watermann, & Hasselhorn, 2013; Becker & Neumann, 2016; Gniewosz, Eccles, & Noack, 2012; Trautwein & Baeriswyl, 2007) . For instance, Arens and Watermann (2015) tested the BFLPE with early-academic-track students and compared its psychosocial consequences with students who stayed at elementary school. Results provided evidence of the BFLPE at the transition into an academic track, while there were no differences in ASCs of students who remained at elementary school. Similarly, drawing on a sample of fourth graders who transitioned from elementary school to secondary school, Becker and Neumann (2016) found that the BFLPE existed in both elementary school and secondary school contexts. However, the BFLPE from elementary school successively decreased and diminished after one year. Thus, given the robustness of the BFLPE in previous research, it can be assumed that the BFLPE will also appear with younger age groups such as elementary school children in Grade 2 who are focused in the present study. However, due to younger children's lower cognitive level and less differentiated ASCs (Harter, 2012) , it can also be suggested that the size of the BFLPE will be smaller than in older students. An explanation of this suggestion is that ASCs of younger children are usually highly positive and are still not highly correlated with external factors such as academic achievement (Harter, 2012; Marsh et al., 2015) . By contrast, with more life experience, children know their strengths and weaknesses much better leading to more realistic ASCs and higher correlations with academic achievement. For instance, Marsh, Craven, and Debus (1998) found a higher reliability, and a more consistent factor structure of self-concept scales with increasing age (children 5-8 years of age) as well as higher correlations of self-ratings in older students with inferred self-concept ratings of teachers. Similar developmental perspectives have also been stated in earlier studies (Chapman & Tunmer, 1995; Harter, 1999; Marsh, 1989; Marsh & Ayotte, 2003; Marsh et al., 2015; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992 ).",

                "text": "The I/E model developed by Marsh (1986) assumes that the relations between academic achievement and ASCs depend on two comparison processes: (1) The social (external) comparison reference process refers to social comparisons, that is, students comparing their academic achievement with that of their classmates in a specific domain. For instance, when students compare their lower math achievement with the higher math achievement levels of their classmates, they are likely to show a more negative math self-concept. By contrast, (2) the dimensional (internal) comparison reference process relates to students who compare their own academic achievement across domains. Due to these contrasting effects, math achievement, for instance, has a negative influence on verbal self-concept, while verbal achievement negatively affects math self-concept. As a result, math and verbal achievement are highly correlated, while ASCs are not or only weakly interrelated. Numerous studies have provided support for the assumptions of the I/ E model (Chiu, 2012; Marsh et al., 2014c; Marsh et al., 2015; M\u00f6ller, Zimmermann, & K\u00f6ller, 2014) . A considerable work on testing the generalizability of the I/E model is, in particular, the meta-analysis conducted by M\u00f6ller et al. (2009) . Using 69 datasets with 125,308 students, results showed that the relations posited by the I/E model did not differ across measures, gender, ages or countries even if the size of the relations among the I/E variables varied from study to study. A shortcoming of this study is, however, the underrepresentation of younger children (only 3 of 69 samples of children in Grade 4 or younger), and thus the developmental generalizability of the I/E model's predictions. Using stronger statistical models and more appropriate tests, Marsh et al. (2015) tested the I/E model with fourth and eighth graders based on data of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). By systematically comparing the results from nationally representative samples of elementary and secondary school students across countries, they found stronger achievement-self-concept relations for eighth graders than fourth graders (more positive within relations and more negative cross-domain relations). However, these developmental differences varied across countries.",

                "text": "According to earlier studies (i.e., Harter, 2012; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992; Wigfield et al., 1997) , younger children usually have an overestimated ASC which is not strongly related to academic achievement. As a consequence, studies on testing the I/E model with elementary school children (i.e., Ehm et al., 2014; M\u00f6ller, Kuska, & Zaunbauer, 2011b; Pinxten et al., 2015) are inconsistent in terms of the size of the achievement-self-concept relations across different grade levels. For instance, using a sample of 1114 German children from Grade 1 to Grade 3, Ehm et al. (2014) tested the I/E model's predictions in the three domains of math, reading, and writing. In the reading domain, the within achievement-self-concept relations varied from 0.27 (Grade 1), 0.41 (Grade 2) to 0.49 (Grade 3), in the writing domain from 0.17 (Grade 1), 0.29 (Grade 2) to 0.45 (Grade 3), and in the math domain from 0.30 (Grade 1), 0.50 (Grade 2) to 0.58 (Grade 3). Conversely, cross-domain achievement-self-concept relations were mixed: Only math achievement showed a significantly negative effect on reading self-concept in Grade 3 (\u03b2 = \u22120.18, p b 0.01), but not in Grade 1 (\u03b2 = \u22120.04) or in Grade 2 (\u03b2 = \u22120.09). Further, math achievement did not significantly negatively affect writing self-concept in all three grade levels (\u03b2 = \u22120.08/\u22120.05/\u22120.08). Similarly, reading achievement had a significantly negative effect on math self-concept in Grade 3 (\u03b2 = \u22120.17, p b 0.05), but not in Grade 1 (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.05) or in Grade 2 (\u03b2 = \u22120.09), and there were no significantly positive effects of reading achievement on writing self-concept in all three grade levels (\u03b2 = 0.03/ 0.04/0.07). Moreover, in all three grade levels, writing achievement significantly positively influenced reading self-concept (\u03b2 = 0.16/0.24/ 0.27, p b 0.01), while writing achievement showed no effect on math self-concept (\u03b2 = \u22120.06/\u22120.05/\u22120.01). In support of the I/E model's predictions, the cross-domain achievement relations were mainly higher than the cross-domain self-concept relations, especially in the math and reading domain (achievements: \u03b2 = 0.45/0.40/0.40 vs. selfconcepts: \u03b2 = 0.30/0.18/0.15) as well as math and writing domain (achievements: \u03b2 = 0.51/0.44/0.40 vs. self-concepts: \u03b2 = 0.36/0.36/ 0.33). However, in the reading and writing domain, the cross-domain relations were significantly positive in all three grade levels (achievements: \u03b2 = 0.55/0.59/0.63 vs. self-concepts: \u03b2 = 0.57/0.44/0.33). Thus, consistent with earlier studies (i.e., Harter, 1999; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992) , the results reported by Ehm et al. (2014) suggests that children's ASCs are more highly related to academic achievement with increasing age. As a result, for the present study on second graders, it can be assumed that the achievement-self-concept relations are weaker than the ones reported for older children in Grade 3 or Grade 4 who were examined by Ehm et al. (2014) .",

Results provided support for the predictions of the BFLP model and the I/E model when integrating both models in the revisited I/E model: Class-average achievement showed a significantly negative influence on ASCs (math domain: B = \u22120.47, p b 0.001; Dutch domain: B = \u22120.36, p b 0.001), while individual achievement had a significantly positive effect on ASC in corresponding domains (math domain: B = 0.54, p b 0.001; Dutch domain: B = 0.41, p b 0.001).

However, these positive compensatory effects were small and a model constraining both compensatory paths to zero fitted the data equally well. Similar results were also found by Marsh (1990a Marsh ( , 1994 indicating significantly positive cross-domain effects of school-average math achievement on English self-concept, and of school-average English achievement on math self-concept. By contrast, results of Parker et al.

The DIRG includes four subtests: The subtest \"BASE\" which was chosen for this study is suitable for application in Grades 1 and 2. It contains addition and subtraction problems up to 20 with and without transition. The subtest \"M100\" refers to multiplication problems, while the subtest \"D100\" includes division problems, and in the subtest \"AS1000\", children are requested to add and subtract three-digit numbers. All subtests have a specific time limit. The retest reliability coefficients of the four subtests reported in the test manual are high, with values ranging from 0.80 to 0.93. Support for the validity of these tests has been reported in many studies (i.e., Ehm et al., 2014; Lindberg, Linkersd\u00f6rfer, Ehm, Hasselhorn, & Lonnemann, 2013) . Thus, using the subtest \"BASE\", the following four arithmetic domains were assessed in the present study: addition with ten transition, addition without ten transition, subtraction with ten transition, and subtraction without ten transition (i.e., 3 + 3). The time limit for each arithmetic domain was four minutes. The manifest scores on these four domains were summed up to a total global score.

                "text": "Before inferential analysis, the total global scores for math and reading achievement were created by calculating the average of the manifest scores on math and reading achievement. As missing values ranged between 1.4 and 5.8% on the item level and the sample size was small, missing scores were imputed by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which provides robust estimates of the asymptotic covariance of the maximum likelihood estimates and warrants more power. When testing the three models, a multilevel latent-manifest covariate confirmatory factor analysis approach was used with Mplus, Version 7.0 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, (1998 which is the standard established method in testing of the BFLPE (Marsh et al., 2009) to account for the nested levels (children nested within classes and schools) within data and correct standard errors accurately. Using this approach, the three self-concept items were Level 1 (L1; student level) indicators of the latent self-concept factors, while the Level 2 (L2; class level) classaverage achievement factor was based on the results to simple (manifest) class-average values of the corresponding L1 indicators of achievement. Thus, the L2 indicators of achievement represented manifestaggregate variables and it can be assumed that class-level achievement variables (Level 2) were estimated accurately with no sampling bias when aggregating children's L1 individual achievement scores (Level 1). School level was not considered in this study because data was available for only an average of 18 students from each school. Before analysis, all L1 indicators of achievement and self-concept items were grandmean centered, while group-centered class-average achievement scores were not re-standardized after being computed. When testing the BFLPE, the within and between-group estimates were calculated and the within-group estimates were subtracted from the betweengroup estimates (Marsh et al., 2009) . The BFLPE was supported if the difference between the coefficient for the class-average achievement and the coefficient for children's individual achievement was significantly negative. In accordance with previous studies (Parker et al., 2013; Pinxten et al., 2015) , effect sizes (ES) of the L2 effects were additionally estimated by using the Model Constraint command in Mplus and the formula ES = 2 \u00d7 B \u00d7 SD predictor /SD criterion (see Marsh et al., 2009) . Small, moderate and large effects are comparable with Cohen's d (1988) , that is, 0.20, 0.50 and 0.80. Given the superiority of weighted least squares (WLS) estimator over maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for variables with less than five categories, the WLSMV estimator was used which includes correction to means and variances of diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) and is specifically designed for use with smaller and moderate samples and less than five categories. Its parameter estimates are based on diagonal weight matrix providing robust standard errors, and a robust mean-and variance-adjusted chisquare statistic to non-normality and non-independence (Byrne, 2012) . When testing social and dimensional comparison effects on children's ASCs directly, some of the parameters were constrained to be equal: For testing social comparison effects directly, cross-domain paths were set to be equal, while for testing dimensional comparison effects directly, within-domain paths were set be invariant. Intraclass correlations (ICC's) for children's math and reading self-concepts at the class level were moderate (math self-concept: ICC = 0.079, reading self-concept: ICC = 0.061). Given the high sensitivity of chi-square statistic to sample size, the following fit indices (Hu & Bentler, 1998) were assessed to evaluate the fit of the models: the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis-index (TLI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) with its confidence interval. A good model fit was established as long as the RMSEA was b0.08 and the CFI and the TLI were \u22650.95 (Hu & Bentler, 1999) . Table 1 shows descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, kurtosis skewness, and intercorrelations for all study variables under investigation.",

Effect sizes of these within achievement-self-concept-relations were high and moderate (math domain: ES = 0.71, reading domain: ES = 0.53). However, the presumed negative cross-domain effects of individual achievements on ASCs were not found, even if the effects were in the expected direction: Individual math achievement showed a more negative effect on reading self-concept (\u03b2 = \u22120.17, ES = \u22120.29), while individual reading achievement revealed a very slightly negative regression coefficient (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.00, p N 0.05, ES = \u22120.01). As a result, in accordance with previous studies, the correlations between ASCs (r = 0.08, p N 0.05) were much smaller than those of achievements (r = 0.41, p b 0.001). Thus, in sum, even if the cross-domain achievement-self-concept-relations missed the significant level, this research suggests that internal comparisons (negative cross-domain relations) and external comparisons (positive horizontal relations) are of importance for second graders' math and reading self-concepts. However, this notion is limited as there was only partial support for direct social and dimensional comparison effects: When testing social comparison effects directly, the difference in chi-square of the less and more restricted models was not significant (\u0394\u03c7 2 = 11.509, \u0394df = 15, p N 0.05), while a significant change in chi-square of the less and more restricted models was found when testing dimensional comparison effects directly (\u0394\u03c7 2 = 45.431, \u0394df = 15, p b 0.001). These results indicated that social comparison effects on second graders' ASCs were stronger than dimensional effects, and that dimensional comparison effects were only of significance for second graders' ASCs if social comparison effects were eliminated.",

However, even if the central assumptions of the I/E model were mainly established, there was no empirical support for the BFLPE, again. Results of the revisited I/E model are presented in Fig. 2 . While class-average reading achievement showed no effect on reading self-concept (\u03b2 = 0.03, p N 0.05, ES = 0.02), the BFLPE was only evident in the math domain, again (\u03b2 = \u22120.07, p b 0.05). However, the effect size of this BFPLE was small (ES = \u22120.23). Moreover, no significantly positive cross-domain compensatory effects of class-average achievement on children's ASCs were found. Rather, results indicated slightly negative effects of class-average achievement in one domain on ASC of a non-corresponding domain (class-average math achievement on reading self-concept: \u03b2 = \u2212 0.03, p N 0.05, ES = \u2212 0.09; class-average reading achievement on math self-concept: \u03b2 = \u22120.07, p N 0.05, ES = \u22120.05).

This result is surprising and not fully in line with Hypothesis 1 given the robustness of the BFLPE in previous research (i.e., Marsh et al., 2014a; Marsh et al., 2014b; Nagengast & Marsh, 2012) -even in samples of elementary school children (i.e., Pinxten et al., 2015; Roy et al., 2015; Szumski & Karwowski, 2015; Wouters et al., 2015) . An explanation for this result may be ceiling effects due to younger children's common over-confidence and cognitive limitations or their less differentiated ASCs (Cimeli, Neuenschwander, R\u00f6thlisberger, & Roebers, 2013; Harter, 2012; Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, & Wigfield, 2002) . By contrast, the BFLPE in the math domain can be explained by the measurement of second graders' math abilities because both addition and subtraction problems with and without transition were assessed in this study. However, the effect size of the BFLPE in the math domain was only moderate. Also, Szumski and Karwowski (2015) reported that a smaller BFLPE was caused by the measurement of a wider range of competencies, but also by differences between school curricula across grade levels. Thus, as the present investigation was conducted in Germany with second graders, it is possible that the missing BFLPE in the reading domain and the relatively small BFLPE in the math domain are caused by the German elementary school system which distinguishes from that of secondary school students or from other school systems around the world: Elementary school children in Germany are recruited in the same class until the end of elementary school years and are, therefore, able to know their classmates much better than secondary school students who are placed in specific classes and groups for different school domains. In addition, second graders in Germany predominantly get verbal achievement feedback and still have no grades which could increase the use of social comparisons and the BFLPE. Rather, achievement feedback is mainly based on temporal comparisons focusing on children's improvement and motivation for learning (Arens et al., 2016) . Consequently, further research must take a broader range of children's math abilities into account and compare social and dimensional comparison effects across different grade levels and school systems more specifically.",

                "text": "In accordance with earlier studies (i.e., Chiu, 2012; Ehm et al., 2014; M\u00f6ller et al., 2009; Pinxten et al., 2015) , all achievement-self-concept relations posited by the I/E model were as expected. However, the cross-domain achievement-self-concept relations were only slightly non-significantly negative indicating that second graders used less dimensional comparisons. These results are comparable to the ones reported by M\u00f6ller et al. (2011b) for third graders in Germany: The effect of German grades on math self-concept was \u22120.15, while the effect of math grades on German self-concept was \u2212 0.01. As in the current study, achievements were higher correlated (r = 0.45, p b 0.01) than ASCs (r = 0.24, p b 0.01). Similar effects were found by Ehm et al. (2014) for second graders in Germany: While no significantly negative cross-domain achievement-self-concept relations were evident (both \u2212 0.09), there were relatively high within-domain achievement-selfconcept relations (math domain: r = 0.50, p b 0.01, reading domain: r = 0.41, p b 0.01) and higher cross-domain relations between achievements (r = 0.40, p b 0.01) than between ASCs (r = 0.18, p b 0.01). However, when comparing the effects of the present study with the ones reported by M\u00f6ller et al. (2009) , (see also M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) , not only the cross-domain relations were smaller (\u22120.17 vs. -0.21 for the effect of math achievement and \u22120.00 vs.-0.27 for the effect of reading achievement), but also the within-domain relations (0.33 vs. 0.49 for the reading domain and 0.39 vs. 0.61 for the math domain). Thus, this research suggests that second graders' ASCs differ from that of secondary school students (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) . As discussed earlier, this might be due to younger children's over-confidence or less differentiated ASCs which is often not congruent with their achievement (Nicholls, 1979; Stipek & MacIver, 1989) . In addition, another reason may be the specific characteristics of the German elementary school system: Classroom teachers in Germany know children's abilities, academic achievement, and endeavor much better than secondary school teachers as elementary school teachers in Germany accompany children through more grade levels than secondary school teachers. Moreover, it must be noted that children at the beginning of their education are still less familiar with grades and learning objectives than older students so that it is reasonable to assume that younger children use less social and dimensional comparisons. However, Hypothesis 2 of the I/E model's predictions can only be partially confirmed by this research.",

Even if the central assumptions of the I/E model were mainly established, the presumed BFLPE was only evident in the math domain, again, but not in the reading domain. Further, there were no significantly positive cross-domain compensatory effects of class-average achievements on ASCs. Thus, these results suggest that class-average achievement in a specific domain is of no importance for second graders' ASCs of a non-corresponding domain, indicating that second graders do not use dimensional comparisons so frequently. Consequently, the results of the present study only partially support Hypothesis 2 and earlier studies (Marsh, 1990a (Marsh, , 1994 Pinxten et al., 2015) . An explanation of the non-significantly effects of class-average achievements on ASCs in this study may be the positive correlation between class-average math and class-average reading achievement (r = 0.24). Pinxten et al. (2015) , for instance, found a much higher correlation (r = 0.72) between class-average math achievement and class-average Dutch achievement indicating that positive compensatory cross-domain effects of group-average achievement variables are of more significance when more differentiated achievement domains are considered.",

This implies that social and dimensional comparisons are of less importance for math and reading selfconcepts in second graders compared to older students, particularly, in terms of dimensional comparisons. However, when testing social and dimensional effects directly, results indicated that dimensional comparisons could also have a significant effect on second graders' ASCs if social comparisons were eliminated. Thus, at least partially evidenced by this research, it can be assumed that second graders do not only compare themselves externally to their peers, but also indirectly, that is, comparing their ability internally across domains (Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002) .",

Given, respectively, the cross-cultural support for reciprocal relations between domain-specific academic achievements and ASCs (i.e., Marsh, 2007; M\u00f6ller, Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2011a; Niepel, Brunner, & Preckel, 2014; Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, & M\u00f6ller, 2014) , further studies must confirm these results longitudinally. Second, the achievement measures used in the present study focused on basic arithmetic skills and reading comprehension, only. Thus, future studies should assess a broader scope of children's math and reading abilities to reveal whether the effects are stronger when considering multiple domains of math and reading skills. Finally, the results were only based on self-reports of second graders in the North of Germany and no characteristics of schools and participants such as the curriculum or the presence of children with special educational needs and children repeating a grade were taken into account. As a result, it would be worthwhile to test the three models by also using school grades or teacher ratings of children's skills or academic achievement in other elementary school systems across countries and cultures.",

Moreover, teachers must keep in mind that both dimensional and social comparisons can have an influence on students' ASCs, and social comparisons often negatively affect students' ASCs. Noteworthy is, in particular, a study conducted by Roy et al. (2015) who examined which students were the most affected by the BFLPE and which teaching practices could attenuate its negative consequences on students'ASC. Results showed that the frequent use of differentiated instruction strategies decreased the BFLPE. Effective strategies for the development of positive psychology school-based programs were, for instance, recently reported by Chodkiewicz and Boyle (2016) giving insight of how strategies can be effectively translated into classroom practice.",
