The present study extended this model by adding another school subject that has not been previously investigated, namely physical education (PE). The central goal was to verify whether Ach in PE positively or negatively predicts academic SC in the mathematics and verbal domains. Design: Prospective study over one school year. Methods: Participants were 451 French high school students (mean age = 13.5). Ach scores in mathematics, French and PE were gathered at the beginning of the school year. At the end of this one, students completed a questionnaire to assess their SC in the three school subjects. Results: Structural Equation Modelling results revealed, according to the I/E model, negative paths between mathematics Ach and verbal SC, and between verbal Ach and mathematics SC. Results also revealed singular relationship patterns between the two traditional school subjects and PE. A positive path between PE Ach and mathematics SC was observed whereas the path with the verbal SC was non-significant. Conclusion: PE could have benefits to increase SC in other school subject such as mathematics. Broader implications of results for the I/E model are discussed.",

In the past decades, researchers have explored the relations between achievement and self-concept in various school subjects (e.g., Byrne, 1986) . Studies have highlighted the paradoxical finding that students' achievements can simultaneously enhance and decrease self-concept. Specifically, self-concept studies generally indicate that mathematics and verbal achievements are strong predictors of corresponding self-concepts in these school subjects, but at the same time, achievement in one school subject negatively predicts self-concept in another subject after controlling for previous achievement in the matching domain. This indicates that selfconcept in a given subject is influenced not only by specific achievement in that subject, but also by achievement in other subjects. These patterns of relations have been investigated under the well-known Internal/External Frame of Reference Model (I/E model, Marsh, 1986) , which has proven quite robust in many different cultures (Marsh & Hau, 2004) .",

However, could achievement in certain less academic school subjects produce a different picture? For example, could achievement in physical education have positive effects on mathematics and verbal self-concepts, after controlling for achievement, instead of negative effects, as predicted by the I/E model? In fact, a host of studies have shown that physical activity has beneficial effects on students' grades, coursework selection, and academic self-concept (see Marsh & Kleitman, 2003) .",

                "text": "According to the I/E model, students' academic self-concepts are influenced by both internal and external comparisons. External reference refers to a social comparison process by which students compare their self-concept of ability in a particular school subject with the accomplishments of other students in the same school subject. This is based on the assumption that social membership provides a frame of reference, or standard of comparison, which is used by the group members in their self-evaluations (e.g., Chanal, Marsh, Sarrazin, & Bois, 2005) . Internal comparison refers to the process by which students compare their performance in a particular school subject to their performance in another subject, independently of social comparison (e.g., Marsh, Smith, & Barnes, 1985) . The external comparison process predicts that better accomplishments in one domain would lead to higher self-concepts in the matching domain. According to the internal comparison process, however, better accomplishments in one domain should lead to lower self-concepts in the non-matching domain, once the positive effects of matching accomplishment are controlled for. For example, students with average achievement in mathematics would gauge their mathematics self-concept depending on whether their achievement in the verbal domain is below or above average. Below average achievement in the verbal domain would lead students to have slightly above average mathematics selfconcepts, because the internal comparison process would lead them to slightly overestimate their abilities in mathematics. Conversely, above average achievement in the verbal domain would lead students to have slightly below average mathematics self-concepts. Thus, the I/E model hypothesizes: (1) a strong and positive correlation between mathematics achievement and verbal achievement; (2) a positive path between academic achievement and self-concept in the same domain; (3) a weak correlation between verbal and mathematics self-concepts; and (4) a negative path between achievement in one school subject to self-concept in another subject (see Marsh & Hau, 2004) .",

For example, Marsh and Kleitman (2003) showed that the more students participated in physical activity, the higher their grades and self-esteem. Studies have also established a positive relationship between physical fitness and academic achievement. For example, Castelli, Hillman, Buck, and Erwin (2007) showed that physical fitness indices (i.e., aerobic capacity and body mass index) were related to academic achievement in third-and fifth-grade students. More precisely, children who displayed better physical health (as assessed by high aerobic capacity and low body mass index) showed, among others, better performance in mathematics and reading.",

Although various positive effects of physical activity on academic achievement and selfconcept have been found, the results were mostly observed in contexts where physical activity was not a compulsory academic school subject for all students. Therefore, when assessing the effects of achievement in physical education on self-concepts in other school subjects, would we observe negative or positive effects? In fact, students might form their self-concepts in various school subjects using the internal and external comparison processes of the I/E model, for a negative effect of achievement in physical education on mathematics and verbal self-concepts. Alternatively, we could argue that students might use their achievement in physical education to foster their mathematics and verbal self-concepts. Specifically, some models (e.g., Broh, 2002) suggest that physical activity may contribute to academic skills by fostering work ethics, respect for authority, and perseverance. Moreover, the positive effects of physical activity on children's cognitive functioning have been supported in recent meta-analyses (e.g., Etnier & Sibley, 2003) . Thus, better grades in physical education could indicate that students have developed cognitive skills (e.g., problem solving skills, attention process, and decision making) that are beneficial for more academic school subjects. In turn, these skills could foster higher self-concepts, thereby leading to a positive relationship between achievement in physical education and self-concepts in other school subjects. Finally, we could assume that students might be unable to use an internal frame of reference based on their achievement in physical education when it comes to assessing self-concept in more academic school subjects. In fact, physical education differs significantly from other school subjects, principally because achievements in this area reflect physical rather than intellectual skills. Therefore, the internal frame of reference effect might be less likely to occur between achievement in this subject and self-concepts in school subjects that require intellectual skills.",

Student achievement in our study is determined by the mean of grades received in the various activities performed during the trimester (from two to four activities). Previous studies have demonstrated the relevance of using grades instead of standardized tests (e.g., Guay, Marsh, & Boivin, 2003) , and that grades are a very good indicator of student achievement (Jussim & Harber, 2005) .

To ascertain model fit, we used the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA), the chi-square test statistic, the chi-square/degrees of freedom ratio (c 2 /df), and the Non-normed Fit Index (NNFI). A non-significant chi-square indicates that the model adequately represents sample data. Browne and Cudeck (1993) suggest that RMSEAs less than 0.05 are indicative of a ''close fit'' and that values up to 0.08 represent reasonable errors of approximation. The Chi-Square/Degrees of Freedom (c 2 /df) Ratio is a test of model misfit (c 2 ), compared to the parsimony of the model as indicated by the model's degrees of freedom (df). In general, a c 2 /df ratio of less than 2 indicates a relatively good model fit. The NNFI varies along a 0-1 continuum, where values greater than 0.95 typically correspond to excellent fit to the data.",

In other words, students with high achievement in mathematics also had high achievement in verbal, and to a lesser extent, physical education. These positive relationships between academic results and physical education are in line with previous results (e.g., Marsh & Hau, 2004; Marsh & Kleitman, 2003) , and they emphasize the particularity of achievement in physical education in the school context. In fact, albeit positive, the relationships between achievement in physical education and achievements in academic school subjects are low, perhaps because abilities assessed in physical education (i.e., motor abilities) are not related to abilities assessed in academic school subjects.",

The nonsignificant relationship between achievement in physical education and verbal self-concept could be explained by the non-academic status of physical education. In effect, there is a hierarchy among school subjects in which physical education (as well as art, music, and other less academic school subjects), is largely considered by students, parents, and teachers as a less important subject than mathematics or verbal subjects. As a result, achievement in physical education does not seem to be involved in the internal comparison process for verbal self-concept. In other words, students do not gauge their verbal self-concept based on their achievement in physical education. In contrast, there is a negative relationship (\u00c00.18) between verbal achievement and physical education selfconcept, after controlling for physical education achievement. Thus, physical education self-concept appears to be gauged by verbal achievement. This relationship is in line with the predictions made for the I/E model.",

Two explanations may be advanced to account for this positive association: (1) transfer of learning skills that are applicable to all subjects; and/or (2) transfer of learning skills that are specific to certain subjects. First, learning in physical education might foster some students' academic skills (e.g., Broh, 2002) , cognitive functioning (e.g., Sibley & Etnier, 2003) , and self-regulation skills (e.g., Milosis & Papaioannou, 2007) that are compatible with learning in more academic school subjects. For example, in an intervention study based on the multidimensional model of goal orientations, Milosis and Papaiaannou (2007) found that students who were taught to use and transfer certain selfregulation skills (i.e., goal setting and self-talk) in physical education classes had better self-concepts in mathematics and verbal domains. However, although these explanations support a positive association between achievement in physical education and other school-subject self-concepts, they do not explain why a beneficial effect on selfconcept was found only for mathematics and not the verbal domain.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated correlations between mathematics performance and spatial ability (e.g., Battista, 1990; Kaufmann, 1990; Hegarty & Kozhevnikov, 1999; Sherman, 1979) . Specifically, the better the students' spatial ability, the better they performed in mathematics. From this perspective, experience in spatial activities (e.g., gymnastics) in physical education classes might be an important cause of improved spatial abilities. Therefore, we can speculate that physical education could increase students' spatial abilities, leading to better achievement in mathematics, which would lead in turn to the development of a better mathematics self-concept. This skill transfer might explain why beneficial effects were observed only for mathematics and not the verbal domain. Nevertheless, this reasoning is speculative, and further studies are required to support this notion before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
