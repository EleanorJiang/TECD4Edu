Shavelson et al. (1976) reviewed theoretical and empirical research and developed a theoretical definition of self-concept and proposed a model that posits self-concept as a multifaceted, hierarchically ordered construct. Shavelson's definition of self-concept, his model, and his proposed self-concept dimensions were the basis of the SDQ used in the present study. Despite the assumption of multidimensionality in the Shavelson model, factor analyses of the most commonly used instruments have typically failed to identify the scales they were designed to measure, although this may be due to the poor construction of many of these instruments (Marsh & Smith, 1982; Shavelson et al., 1976; Wylie, 1974 Wylie, , 1979 . More recently, researchers have developed self-concept instruments specifically to measure facets of self that are at least loosely tied to a theoretical model, and factor analyses of responses to these instruments have provided stronger support for the multidimensionality of self-concept (e. g., Boersma & Chapman, 1979; Dusek & Flaherty, 1981; Fleming & Courtney, 1984; Harter, 1982; Soares & Soares, 1977) . The strongest support for the multidimensionality of self-concept, particularly the facets proposed in the Shavelson model, comes from work with the SDQ (Marsh, Barnes, Cairns, & Tidman, 1984; Marsh, Relich, & Smith, 1983; Shavelson & Marsh, in press ).",

Marsh and Shavelson (in press ; also see Harter, 1982) distinguished between three implicit definitions of the term general self-concept: a total score across a broad collection of selfreport items; a higher order factor inferred to be the apex of a hierarchy of more specific self-concept facets; and a separate, distinguishable facet that is viewed as a superordinate dimension and is sometimes called self-esteem. They indicated the need to empirically examine these different definitions of general self. In response to this need, the SDQ was revised to include a General Self scale that is based on the Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale. Thus, one purpose of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of this new scale and to determine if it can be distinguished from self-concepts in more specific areas.",

With EFA the researcher is unable to define the model to be tested beyond specifying the number of factors and perhaps the extent of correlation among the factors, and the obtained solution is not unique. When the observed factor structure does not correspond to the hypothesized structure there is no way to determine how well the hypothesized structure would fit the data. In CFA the researcher is able to define the specific model to be examined, to test its ability to fit the data, and to compare the goodness of fit of the hypothesized model with alternative specifications. Confirmatory factor analysis has been used to test the hypothesized factor structure underlying academic self-concept (Shavelson & Bolus, 1982) , to confirm the factor structure underlying responses to the SDQ, and to examine the higher order structure of the SDQ facets (Marsh & Hocevar, 1985; Shavelson & Marsh, in press) .",

Such a test is important in its own right and also because factorial invariance is an implicit assumption in the comparison of mean responses for different subgroups so that its violation renders the interpretations of mean differences dubious. Although many researchers have examined sex differences in selfconcept, we know of no CFA to test the invariance of the factor structure of selfconcept across responses by boys and by girls. A few studies have compared EFAs of responses by male and female subjects (e.g., Dusek & Flaherty, 1981) , but the advantages of CFA over EFA for such a purpose are so important that Alwin and Jackson (1981; also see Marsh & Hocevar, 1985) concluded that \"the issues of factorial invariance are not adequately addressed using exploratory factor analysis\" (p. 250) and that \"the use of exploratory factor analysis in its conventional form to examine issues of factorial invariance is of limited utility\" (p. 253).",

She suggested, however, that differences in specific components of self-concept may be lost when responses to items are summed to obtain a total score. Dusek and Flaherty (1981) , in their longitudinal study of adolescent self-concepts, reported differences in specific areas of selfconcept that were consistent with sex stereotypes: Boys had higher self-concepts in masculinity and achievement/leadership and lower self-concepts in congeniality/sociability. Research on the SDQ has typically found sex differences favoring boys in self-concept of Physical Ability and favoring girls in Reading in preadolescent and adolescent (Marsh, Parker, & Barnes, in press) responses and sex differences favoring boys' Math selfconcept during adolescent years. Fleming and Courtney (1984) found significant sex effects in self-concepts of university students, but concluded that only the difference in Physical Ability favoring male subjects was large enough to be practically significant. In summary, although there appears to be little evidence of sex differences in total self-concept, there do appear to be systematic sex differences in particular dimensions of self-concept that are consistent with sex stereotypes.",

Meece, Parsons, Kaczala, Goff, and Futterman (1982) reviewed this literature and reported that sex differences in achievement and self-concept were not large in the elementary school years, but that girls have lower levels of achievement and self-concept in junior and senior high school years. These findings are consistent with SDQ research that found no sex differences in Math self-concept for preadolescents (Grades 2 to 5; ) but significant differences favoring boys in high school (Grades 7 to 11; Marsh et al., in press) . The Meece et al. review suggested that as students go through their junior and senior high school years math self-concept declines, but the decline begins sooner and is larger for girls than for boys. This pattern of sex differences occurs despite the finding that during elementary and junior high school years, girls generally perform as well as boys on standardized tests of math achievement (e.g., Fennema, 1974; Sherman, 1980) . Meece et al. asserted that the decline in math self-concept precedes the decline in math achievement and that socialization processes that affect math selfconcept are one cause of the decline in achievement. Particularly persuasive support for this assertion would be the demonstration that girls have significantly lower math self-concepts even though their actual school performance and/or achievement in mathematics equals or surpasses that of boys. Extrapolating from the Meece et al. review, such an occurrence would be most likely during late primary or early junior high school years; the examination of such a possibility was the third purpose of the present investigation. It must be emphasized, however, that because the present investigation was not a longitudinal study, this hypothesis could not be fully tested. Hence, such a finding would be meaningful only in the context of other research that demonstrates that by high school years girls have lower math scores in achievement and in self-concept.",

For example, Marsh, Relich, and Smith (1983) showed that mathematics achievement was correlated substantially with Math selfconcept (.55), less correlated with self-concepts in other areas (Reading .21 and General School .43), and uncorrelated with selfconcepts in four nonacademic areas.

This expectation was incorporated into the Shavelson model, in which academic selfconcepts in particular subject areas were posited to form a general academic selfconcept. Hence it was surprising that Math and Reading self-concepts have been found to be nearly uncorrelated in SDQ research. In studies with older students (Marsh & O'Niell, 1984; Marsh et al., in press) indicators of achievement in mathematics and in verbal areas were highly correlated with each other and with self-concepts in these two areas, even though the two self-concepts were nearly uncorrelated. Paradoxically, once the effect of mathematics achievement was controlled for, the correlation between verbal achievement and Math self-concept was negative, and once the effect of verbal achievement was controlled for, the correlation between mathematics achievement and Verbal selfconcept was also negative. In response to proposed counterexplanations of this finding, Marsh, Smith, and Barnes (1983) demonstrated that this lack of correlation was consistent across responses by girls and boys and across items that reflected academic ability and academic interest that were contained in the SDQ. This finding led to a revision of the Shavelson model (Shavelson & Marsh, in press) in which self-concepts in particular subject areas were posited to form verbal/academic and mathematical/academic self-concepts.",

Hence, the development and testing of the internal/external (I/E) frame of reference model to explain this paradoxical phenomenon was the fourth purpose of the present investigation.

Across all the children in the study, academic abilities were around average. The Self Description Questionnaire (SDQ) was administered by one of the authors to intact classes of no more than 34 students. Several practice examples were given as well as instructions to ensure that pupils understood what was expected of them, and then the items were read aloud at a fairly rapid pace. (Children had copies of the instruments in front of them and could read along with the researcher.) At the same time, the classroom teacher was asked to complete a rating sheet on each child that included ability ratings for reading, math, and school subjects in general. Teacher ratings were made with a 9-point response scale from 1 (very poor) to 9 (very good).

In the CFA models solutions were hypothesized where each measured variable was allowed to define one and only one factor, the factors were correlated, and error/uniqueness terms for the measured variables were uncorrelated. 1 The ability of the pro-posed models to fit responses to the SDQ was determined by an examination of the parameter estimates, the ratio of the chi-square to the degrees of freedom, and coefficient d (Bentler & Bonett, 1980) . There are no universally accepted guidelines for evaluating goodness-of-fit (Fornell, 1983) , although the ratio of the chi-square to degrees of freedom is the most commonly used index. Some researchers argue that chisquare/degrees of freedom ratios as high as 5 may indicate a good fit (e.g., Wolfle, 1981) , and others claim that a ratio of 2 or less is required (e.g., Alwin & Jackson, 1981) , but most agree that ratios of less than 2 indicate a good fit. In the CFA models, analyses were performed on variance-covariance matrices representing responses for boys and for girls. In the first model, no parameters were assumed to be the same for boys and girls, while in alternative models various subsets of parameters were set to be invariant across the two samples so that for the most restrictive model all parameters were hypothesized to be the same. A more detailed presentation of CFA, goodness of fit, and factorial invariance across different groups was beyond the scope of the present study, but these topics are discussed elsewhere (Alwin & Jackson, 1981; Bentler & Bonett, 1980; Joreskog & Sorbom, 1981; Marsh & Hocevar, 1983 , 1985 Maruyama & McGarvey, 1980; Wolfle, 1981) .",

Nevertheless, the results of the path models confirm the paradoxical set of relations among the achievement and self-concept variables that has been found with responses by older students.

Previous research has generally used exploratory factor analysis. However, limitations inherent in the application of exploratory factor analysis render it relatively unsuitable for many important problems in self-concept research, such as testing the invariance of factor structures 2 An anonymous reviewer questioned whether two aspects of the sample, the disproportionately large proportion of boys and the missing values for the achievement indicators, may have biased the results. The original purpose of the study was to study selfconcept/academic achievement relations, and no attempt was made to balance the sample in terms of sex; the use of seven predominantly single-sex schools made it likely that there would not be equal numbers of boys and girls. Although the unequal numbers of boys and girls is somewhat embarrassing and could have been controlled for in the original design, there is no reason to suspect that it produced any bias in the results. The potential bias due to missing values in the achievement indicators-the test scores and teacher ratings-was discussed briefly in the statistical analysis portion of the Method section where it was indicated that correlations, and thus the path analyses in Figure 2 , were similar whether based on pairwise or casewise deletion of missing data. It is important to emphasize that virtually no students had missing values for both test scores and teacher ratings, that these two achievement indicators were substantially correlated, and that each provides a reasonable basis for inferring achievement. Hence the similarity of the findings based on test scores, which excluded subjects with missing test scores (Model 1 in Figure 2) ; on teacher ratings, which excluded subjects with missing teacher ratings (Model 2 in Figure 2) ; and on the average of all available achievement indicators, which excluded virtually no subjects (Model 3 in Figure 2 ) provides further evidence that the missing values for these indicators did not produce a bias in the results. Similarly, the modest but statistically significant sex differences favoring girls over boys in reading and mathematics achievement was observed for both test scores and teacher ratings. In summary, it seems unlikely that either of the potential problems with the sample identified by the reviewer is likely to have had a substantial impact on the findings of this study. across subgroups. Confirmatory factor analyses described here replicated previous findings with the earlier version of the SDQ, but this is the first confirmation of the new General Self scale on the revised instrument, and this scale has important theoretical implications (Marsh & Shavelson, in press ).",

This pattern of results is consistent, however, with the internal/external frame of reference model depicted in Figure 1 . According to this model, a student compares his or her abilities with those of other students (an external comparison) and also compares his or her own abilities in different academic areas. Hence a student whose academic abilities are low in both math and reading (compared with those of other students-an external comparison) but whose ability in math is better than in reading (an internal comparison) may have an average, or even above-average self-concept in mathematics.

Hence, once the effect of reading achievement is controlled for, it is the difference between reading and math achievements that determines reading selfconcept, and the direct effect of math achievement is predicted to be negative.

Consequently, in these studies we had to assume that selfperceptions of academic ability are reasonably well represented by actual ability/ achievement; support for the model justifies this assumption. Nicholls (1979) , however, asked children between the ages of 6 and 12 to rank their own reading ability compared with other children in their classroom and found that the accuracy of their perceptions varied substantially with age: Self-ratings and teacher ratings for the youngest children were nearly uncorrelated. The validity of the internal/external frame of reference model does not depend on self-perceptions' being accurate, but tests of the validity of the model will be more difficult to formulate if they are not. Consequently, although the model appears valid for a wide range of ages, it has not been tested with very young children under the age of 10, with whom tests of its validity may be more difficult to formulate.",

Each model inTable 2was tested with covariance matrices rather than correlation matrices. For Model 1, in which there were no invariance constraints, the observed chi-square values would be the same for either metric, but for each of the other models observed chi-squares would be smaller and goodnessof-fit indicators superior if the models were tested with the correlation metric.This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.",
