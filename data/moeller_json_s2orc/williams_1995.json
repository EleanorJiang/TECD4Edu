Differentiated from social, behavioral, physical, or other domains of self-concept, academic self-concept is the belief one has about one's general ability relative to school performance. The overall association of academic self-concept to academic achievement appears to make intuitive sense: the better one thinks one can do in school, the better one performs. On the other hand, current research with gifted students (e.g., Van Boxtel & Monks, 1992) indicates that multidimensional self-concept models (see Byme & Shavelson, 1986; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) are necessary in differentiating the effects of achievement on self-concept. Recent findings demonstrate distinct cognitive differences between students who are gifted in mathematics and students who are gifted in verbal areas (Benbow & Minor, 19901 and these findings lend support for further differentiating academic self-concept into verbal and mathematic areas for able learners.",

According to this theory, students concurrently compare both their individual academic achievements across subject areas (internal comparisons) and their ability level relative to others within their learning environment (external comparisons). For example, an internal comparison is the perception that one's performance is better in mathematics than language; thus, this student exhibits higher mathematics self-concept. An external comparison refers to the belief that one's mathematics performance is better than other students in the mathematics class; subsequently, this student reports high mathematics self -concept. The theoretical model depicted in Figure 1 was developed to explain the frame of reference theory (Marsh, 1986) . The model predicts a substantial positive correlation between verbal and mathematics achievement and is based upon well-documented reports in the literature. Strong positive direct effects for both verbal achievement on verbal self-concept and for mathematics achievement on mathematics self-concept are predicted. These expected effects are due to the external comparison process on student verbal and mathematics selfconcepts. The model also posits a weak negative direct effect of verbal achievement on mAthematics self-concept and mathematics achievement on verbal self-concept due to the internal comparison process. In support of the strong positive-weak negative predicted pattern of effects, research has found achievement in specific academic areas to be more highly correlated with self-concept in matching areas than in other areas (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) . Finally, because students theoretically combine both external (positive effects) and internal (negative effects) processes, the relationship between verbal and mathematics self-concepts is specified to be approximately zero.",

Although the internal/external process posited in the frame of reference theory has been supported through research using average-ability students, the model has apparently not been examined with high-ability students.

The majority of the participants were white, middleto upper-middle-class students nominated by parents or teachers for placement in the honors science program. All students participated in at least two honors courses during their academic year. High achievement scores (85th percentile) in any area could be used as support for program placement, but those scores were not the sole criterion and therefore some variance in achievement was to be expected.

All items were then altered to direct the student's attention to mathematics and then to language or English. For example, the statement \"I am smart\" became \"I am smart in English\" or \"I am smart in Math.\" \"I do well on tests\" became \"I do well on Math tests\" and \"I do well on English\" tests. Students responded to the final 35-item, domain-specific self-concept scales by either agreeing or disagreeing with each statement. Possible scores ranged from 0-35, with one point given for each item of agreement. Thus, higher scores indicated higher perceived languageherbal or mathematics self-concept. Coefficient alpha estimates calculated on the student sample for each modified self-concept scale revealed good internal consistency reliabilities (verbal = .854j mathematics = .855).",

                "text": "The theoretical linkage presumed to exist among the variables is graphically presented in Figure 1 . (See Table 1 for descriptive statis- tics.) This model was tested with conventional path analysis, which is used to estimate model parameters via a series of multiple regressions (Pedhazur, 1982) . Figure 2 contains the estimated path coefficients (standardized regression coefficients) presented along the unidirectional arrows. The relative size of each coefficient is indicative of that variable's predictive importance in the model. Additionally, when a path coefficient is squared, this value represents the percentage of explained variance for each path. Bivariate correlations between the achievement and self-concept variables in the model are given in parentheses on the diagram. As predicted, a strong positive correlation was obtained between verbal and mathematics achievement; about 49% of the variance was shared, and verbal and mathematics self-concepts were not significantly related (r = .0295). Significant positive effects of verbal achievement were anticipated and achieved on verbal self-concept, and significant positive effects of mathematics achievement were anticipated and achieved on mathematics self-concept (support for an external frame of reference). Whereas, verbal achievement had a significant negative effect on mathematics self-concept, mathematics achievement had a low negative effect on verbal self-concept (support for an internal frame of reference). Thus, the pattern of the results in the path analysis shown in Figure 2 indicates that the theory withstood the statistical test and was not disconfirmed. The lack of correlation between the self-concept dimensions suggests that the academically able students used both internal and external frames of reference in determining their academic self-concepts.

The current study reveals that achievement in mathematics and verbal areas are highly correlated, whereas academic self-concepts are not. Interpreted in light of the theoretical model presented in Figure 1 , this means that perceptions of differential ability in mathematics or verbal areas (internal) and perceptions of ability differences relative to others in the class (external) appears to affect the formulation of academic self-concept for the students in the study. However, the coefficients represent-ing the internal comparison processes are negative as hypothesized, but they are not of the same magnitude. The negative path from verbal achievement to mathematic self-concept reaches statistical significance while the path from mathematics achievement to verbal self-concept does not. This pattern of results replicates findings with the general population currently being reported elsewhere (Skaaivik & Rankin, 1990; Tay, Licht, Tate, & Simpson, 1994) . Although both self-concepts appear to be influenced by internal and external processes, verbal self-concept is more influenced by external and less influenced by internal processes than is mathematics self-concept. In other words, for two able learners with similar achievement in mathematics, the student with the lower verbal achievement tends to exhibit higher mathematics self-concept. On the other hand, given similar verbal achievement, those with lower mathematics achievement do not necessarily report higher verbal self-concept.",
