    "abstract": "The internal/external frame of reference model (I/E model) posits that individuals' achievement-related self-concepts are formed through social comparisons (e.g., self vs. peers) within academic domains and dimensional comparisons (e.g., math vs. verbal) between distinct domains. A large body of research has supported the theorized pattern of positive within-domain and negative cross-domain effects of achievement on self-concept. However, research on moderators of these effects has been scarce. In this article, we report results from 2 samples of 7th graders (N sample1 \u03ed 1,045 and N sample2 \u03ed 1,966) in which we investigated whether students' perceptions of teachers' domain-specific competence in judging students' achievement moderated the relation between teacher-assigned grades and students' self-concepts in the I/E model. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the I/E model, which also included teachers' perceived diagnostic competence in each domain (i.e., math and verbal) and 4 latent interaction variables derived from that competence and from school grades in both domains. Both studies found support for the predictions of the I/E model. The cross-domain effect on math self-concept was consistently moderated in both studies: The lower students perceived their teachers' competence in diagnosing math achievement, the stronger the negative path from verbal grade to math self-concept. Furthermore, the results tentatively imply that the positive within-domain effect of verbal grade on verbal self-concept is stronger when students' perceptions of teachers' diagnostic competence in judging verbal achievement are higher. The results extend knowledge on the conditions of academic self-concept formation and provide valuable insights into possible ramifications of teachers' judgment accuracy. Educational Impact and Implications Statement This study suggests that students' beliefs in their competence partly depend on their beliefs in their teachers' ability to judge the students' achievement correctly. That means, for example, when students perceive their teachers' competence in diagnosing verbal achievement to be high, verbal grades may more strongly impact students' verbal competence belief. Our results show in particular that, when students perceive their teachers' competence in diagnosing math achievement to be low, students' math self-concept is influenced more strongly by other sources than math grades, namely, by contrasting with verbal achievement. The results point out the importance of teachers' diagnostic competence.",

Self-concept features prominently in major theoretical accounts of motivational research, including expectancy-value the-ory (Eccles, 1983) , self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2002) , and Pintrich's (2003) delineation of motivational science. Eccles (1983) , for example, proposed that academic self-concept is influenced by prior scholastic failure and success and plays a central role in the development of motivation and academic choice behavior. High academic self-concept is indeed associated with positive scholastic outcomes such as motivation and achievement (e.g., Valentine et al., 2004) .",

                "text": "Scholars from various theoretical approaches have emphasized that academic self-concept is affected by students' achievement, possibly through comparison processes (Marsh, 1986; Marsh & Craven, 2006; M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013; Mussweiler, R\u00fcter, & Epstude, 2006; Suls & Wheeler, 2000) . Two of the more prominent in explaining the formation of self-concept are social and dimensional comparisons. Social comparisons use others as a standard for evaluating oneself, whereas dimensional comparisons involve using one's own achievements in other domains as the standard for evaluation (Biernat & Eidelman, 2007; Eccles, 2009; Festinger, 1954) . In his internal/external frame of reference model (I/E model), Marsh (1986) described the juxtaposition of social and dimensional comparisons and their impact on an individual's domain-specific academic self-concepts. The I/E model is quite popular in research on self-concept development. In their metaanalysis on 69 studies, M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, K\u00f6ller, and Marsh (2009) found strong support for the central assumptions of the I/E model. For example, the findings indicated that the effects of social and dimensional comparisons are not restricted to specific age groups, gender groups, or countries. The potential moderators investigated in the meta-analysis largely failed to explain the variance in effects between studies, which existed regarding the cross-domain effects in particular. It is interesting to note that there is little research explicitly investigating moderation to explain the variance in effects in the I/E model at the student level. The purpose of this study was to investigate the conditions under which the achievements of others and one's own achievements in different domains contribute to the formation of domain-specific academic self-concepts. To that end, we introduced into the I/E model students' perceptions of their teachers' competence to assess achievement as a potential moderator of the relationship between achievement and self-concept. The idea is that students who perceive the reliability of their teacher-assigned grades as low are less inclined to use social comparison information, which is based on these grades but, due to the need of other information sources, more strongly use dimensional comparison information. In the following sections, we first describe the social and dimensional comparison processes posited by the I/E model and second describe teachers' competence to diagnose achievement.",

Regarding the four path coefficients that are central to the evaluation of the I/E model, multigroup analyses revealed significant moderation of the positive within-domain paths by (a) the type of achievement measure (grades assigned by teachers vs. standardized tests) and (b) the type of self-belief measure (academic self-concept vs. self-efficacy). The only significant moderation regarding the negative cross-domain paths involved the path from math achievement to verbal self-concept, and this was due to the sample size of the data sets as a methodologically relevant moderator.",

The group differences suggest that dimensional comparisons are moderated by students' perceived relationship between achievements in the contrasting domains. In a similar vein, students' theories about math and verbal abilities in general, that is, whether they believe that both are negatively interdependent or rather independent of each other, moderated dimensional comparisons (more consistently than did social comparisons; M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, Streblow, & Kaufmann, 2002; M\u00f6ller, Streblow, & Pohlmann, 2006) : The cross-domain paths in the I/E model were more pronounced when students believed that verbal and math skills were rather distinct. Using an experimental research design, Helm, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, Nagy, and M\u00f6ller (2016) demonstrated the causal effect of perceived subject similarity on domain-specific self-concepts: Lower perceived subject similarity led to stronger dimensional comparison effects than did higher perceived subject similarity.

Research on the I/E Model and beyond has underscored the role of teachers' assessments of achievement in students' self-related cognitions (M\u00f6ller et al., 2009; Zimmermann, Sch\u00fctte, Taskinen, & K\u00f6ller, 2013) . What are the consequences for students of teachers' accuracy in judging their achievement? Urhahne, Chao, Florineth, Luttenberger, and Paechter (2011) , for example, showed that misjudgment of students' mathematics achievement had consequences for the students' academic self-concept, expectations of success, and test anxiety. The social and dimensional comparison processes described in the I/E model may depend on the extent to which the feedback provided by grades from a teacher is perceived as a reliable and credible basis on which students can evaluate their own abilities. Social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) posits that people strive to evaluate their abilities. The motivations for social comparisons may differ (Festinger, 1954) . People may be motivated to (a) evaluate their strengths and weaknesses accurately to gain an understanding of their behavioral effectiveness (Anderson & Lux, 2004; Mead, 1934; Ruble, Boggiano, Feldman, & Loebl, 1980) , (b) maintain their self-view or (c) enhance their self-image when comparing themselves with others (Tesser, 1988) , or (d) improve their abilities by learning from more accomplished students (Dijkstra, Kuyper, van der Werf, Buunk, & van der Zee, 2008). With social comparison theory setting the stage for the recently introduced dimensional comparison theory, M\u00f6ller and Marsh (2013) postulated that these motivations also apply to dimensional comparisons.",

For example, students who perceive that their math teacher is not really capable of diagnosing their math achievement should be less inclined to use the grades that the teacher gives as a basis for evaluating their own skills in mathematics and be more inclined to use other sources to evaluate their ability.

The interindividual variance in teachers' competence to diagnose achievement may be reflected in the teachers' diagnostic competence as perceived by the students or may be even greater given the subjectivity of their individual perceptions. How students subjectively perceive their teachers' competence in assessing achievement is a crucial factor in determining whether students will take into account the feedback they receive from their teachers.

If students perceive a teacher to be competent to assess their performance in a given domain, one would expect the grades given by that teacher to contribute to the formation of their self-concept within that domain.

The present article is based on self-reported data from seventh graders and on their report card grades from the end of Grade 6. The students' families were characterized by low to moderate socioeconomic status, based on the Highest International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status [HISEI] of the mother and father as reported by the parents (M \u03ed 39, SD \u03ed 14 in Sample 1 and M \u03ed 46, SD \u03ed 14 in Sample 2; on a scale from 16 to 90, with higher scores indicating higher socioeconomic status; Ganzeboom & Treiman, 1996 ; M HISEI \u03ed 49, SD \u03ed 16, for countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; Klieme et al., 2010) .

Domain-specific mathematics self-concept (MSC) and verbal selfconcept (VSC) were defined in terms of students' general belief that they were doing well or poorly in that domain. Mathematics and verbal self-concepts were each measured by four items selected from previously developed scales (Jerusalem, 1984; Jopt, 1978) . Sample items include \"I am not particularly good in mathematics\" and \"Nobody's perfect. I am just not talented in German.\" Responses were rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (agree) to 4 (disagree), with higher scores indicating a more favorable self-concept. Reliabilities were good; Students' perceptions of their teachers' diagnostic competence concerning mathematics achievement (PDC-MACH) and verbal achievement (PDC-VACH) were assessed using a five-item scale developed in the course of the BIJU study (Learning Processes, Educational Careers, and Psychosocial Development in Adolescence and Young Adulthood; Baumert, Gruehn, Heyn, K\u00f6ller, & Schnabel, 1997 ; partially based on Fend & Specht, 1986) . The items were \"Our math [German] teacher . . .\" \". . . knows exactly how each of us performs,\" \". . . notices immediately if one does not understand something,\" \". . . knows immediately which tasks are difficult for us,\" \". . . knows immediately what one has not understood,\" and \". . . notices immediately when a student cannot keep up in class.\" Responses were rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (agree) to 4 (disagree). To facilitate the interpretation of results, we reverse-coded the items so that higher scores represented greater perceived competence. Reliabilities were good; Furthermore, we conducted a series of multigroup confirmatory factor models of ascending restrictiveness in each of the two samples to test for the scales' measurement invariance across different school tracks (e.g., Meredith & Teresi, 2006; Steinmetz, Schmidt, Tina-Booh, Wieczorek, & Schwartz, 2009) . According to the recommended criteria of differences in CFI \u03fd .01 and RMSEA \u03fd .015 (Chen, 2007; Cheung & Rensvold, 2002) , the model assuming metric measurement invariance fit the data equally as well as did the least restrictive baseline model of configural measurement invariance (Sample 1: \u232cCFI \u03ed .001, \u232cRMSEA \u03ed .001; Sample 2: \u232cCFI \u03ed .000 and \u232cRMSEA \u03ed .002), and the more restrictive model of scalar measurement invariance fit equally as well as did the model assuming metric measurement invariance (Sample 1: \u232cCFI \u03ed .003, \u232cRMSEA \u03ed .000; Sample 2: \u232cCFI \u03ed .002, \u232cRMSEA \u03ed .001). The well-fitting measurement models, which functioned equally well in different school tracks, prove the scales' factorial validity and support the comparability regarding their meaning across academic and nonacademic track schools. Moreover, although small to moderate associations are plausible, students should not merely state that a teacher is not competent to diagnose achievement just because they feel unjustly treated or simply do not like the teacher. Correlations in the sample of seventh graders from the BIJU study show that the latent factor of perceived teachers' diagnostic competence concerning math achievement is positively related with but different from liking the teacher (\"I like our math teacher very much\", Baumert et al., 1997 ; n \u03ed 5,420; r \u03ed .45, p \u0545 .001) and feelings of justice concerning the given grades (\"Our math teacher assigns grades fairly\", Baumert et al., 1997 ; n \u03ed 5,821; r \u03ed .28, p \u0545 .001), which supports the validity of the construct. In addition, factor analyses from prior research using the perceived teachers' diagnostic competence scales regarding math, physics, and biology from the BIJU study support that students differentiate between the different subjects when judging their teachers' diagnostic competences rather than that their judgments are a result of individual perceptual biases (Gruehn, 2000) .",

Moderation of paths in the I/E model was analyzed by including latent interaction variables between achievement and perceived diagnostic competence using the unconstrained approach (Marsh, Wen, & Hau, 2004) . This approach does not require constraints on the factor loadings of the product indicators. As Marsh et al. (2004) have shown, moreover, the unconstrained approach is preferable to constrained approaches when variables are nonnormally distributed. After centering the indicators, we formed cross products by multiplying indicators from the variables involved in a specific interaction. These products were then used as indicators of the latent product variables. Consistent with the unconstrained approach of Marsh et al. (2004) , the loadings of the product indicators were unconstrained. The errors of the product indicators that had a common component covaried. Means of the manifest first-order predictors (achievements) were zero because they had been centered, and means of the latent first-order predictors (perceived diagnostic competence) were fixed to zero; means of the latent product variables were equivalent to the covariance between the first-order variables (Steinmetz, Davidov, & Schmidt, 2011) . The latent product variables were entered into the model along with the first-order predictors. The latent and manifest exogenous variables as well as the latent dependent variables were allowed to correlate.",

The finding is as expected and suggests that verbal achievement is less important for the math self-concept when the teachers' diagnostic competence in math is believed to be high. Conversely, students' math self-concept tends to be particularly influenced by verbal achievement when students believe that their math teachers' diagnostic competence is low. Therefore, the effects of dimensional comparisons related to grades on domainspecific self-concept seem to be (at least in part) a consequence of a low level of trust in teachers' diagnostic competence. Accordingly, math teachers' perceived diagnostic competence is taken into account when students evaluate their abilities in math based on dimensional comparisons of achievements. In accordance with the predominantly self-serving nature of dimensional comparisons, students may exaggerate their abilities in a given domain by comparing them with worse grades in a contrasting domain (cf. . Our studies show that the math self-concept of those with worse verbal grades generally benefits from the contrast effect rather independently of their math teacher's perceived diagnostic competence. We have consistently found that students with better verbal grades suffer from negative contrasting effects on their math self-concept, particularly when they perceive their math teacher's diagnostic competence to be low: Students with good verbal grades tend to have a worse opinion of their math skills the less they trust their math teacher's competence in diagnosing achievement. Thus, students might give relatively more weight to other sources such as contrasting subject domains by means of dimensional comparison when they perceive their teacher's competence to assess achievement in the relevant domain to be low.",

Explicitly or implicitly, students surely attach great importance to their teachers' assessments of academic achievement as reflected in school grades. These teacher assessments are an important currency in school when it comes to decisions regarding students' further educational careers within and beyond school (Harlen, 2005) .

Considering the bigger picture, it has to be kept in mind that these are only some aspects of the information that may flow into the formation of students' self-concepts. An exciting challenge for self-concept research is the fact that the various frames of reference and other sources of information for selfbeliefs are often in place simultaneously. For example, the total effect of an exam on domain-specific self-concept will depend on how a student weighs all these pieces of comparative information. Not surprisingly, the comparison processes (i.e., social, dimensional, temporal comparisons, and comparison with a criterion) and their interdependence (see, e.g., Wakslak, Nussbaum, Liberman, & Trope, 2008; Wilson & Ross, 2000; Zell & Alicke, 2009) as well as other sources of information for self-beliefs like the average class or school ability (Chmielewski, Dumont, & Trautwein, 2013; Marsh, 1987) , the reputation of the school (Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2000) , socializers' feedback (Pohlmann, M\u00f6ller, & Streblow, 2004) , expectancy effects (Jussim & Harber, 2005) , and gender stereotypes (Watt & Eccles, 2008) continue Figure 5 .

This also involves providing helpful individual feedback about performance level and knowledge gaps or to judge students' performance based on an individual frame of reference. Previous research in the domain of mathematics has shown that teachers' use of an individual frame of reference as perceived by students is positively associated with their self-concepts (L\u00fcdtke, K\u00f6ller, Marsh, & Trautwein, 2005) . It is therefore possible that students' math self-concepts are higher, the more they perceive that their math teachers judge achievement highly based on an individual frame of reference, which should be linked to their perception that the math teachers are highly competent in diagnosing math achievement. In contrast, this correlation was consistently nonsignificant in the verbal domain, perhaps because of the high level of heterogeneity of the verbal selfconcept (Arens & Jansen, 2016) .",

However, it is not without certain limitations. The design of the studies is not truly longitudinal, which precludes the interpretation of results in terms of causal effects. The participants in our studies consisted of a comparatively high proportion of students with an immigration background and were on average from families with a low to moderate socioeconomic background. It is therefore an open question whether the results replicate to student samples with a different composition. Coefficients of the dimensional comparison paths in the I/E model were somewhat lower in these studies compared with those found on average in the meta-analysis by M\u00f6ller et al. (2009) . It is uncertain whether these relatively weak weights indicate the presence of moderators only in our particular samples or whether the phenomenon is more generally valid. A further issue, which the study leaves open for future research, is the generalizability of the results to different domains other than the verbal and mathematics domains. Moreover, it still appears puzzling to us that not all of the interactions yielded significant effects. The interaction effects found were not all replicated, and those significant were rather small. Although there is theoretical importance, it is therefore questionable whether these effects are of great importance, and the practical relevance is probably low. All in all, additional research is needed, and we hope to initiate future research to accumulate more substantial knowledge on the issue of conditions under which students' achievements contribute to the formation of academic self-concepts.",

Imagine students who dislike their math teacher. They might disassociate themselves from the math grades, leading to a lower withindomain effect and a stronger cross-domain effect compared with those who like their math teacher. Another candidate for moderation of effects in the I/E model could be the belief in fairness of teacher-assigned grades. If grades are perceived as being assigned unjustly in class in a domain, this might lead to lower within-domain effects and stronger cross-domain effects. Because our additional analyses of data from the BIJU study indicate that there is a certain (small) amount of overlap between perceived teachers' competence to diagnose math achievement with liking of the math teacher and with feelings of justice regarding grade assignment in math, it would also be important to take into account intercorrelations of these variables within one moderation model to examine their unique contributions.",

The P&C Board is particularly interested in encouraging members of underrepresented groups to participate more in this process.If you are interested in reviewing manuscripts, please write APA Journals at Reviewers@apa.org. Please note the following important points:\u2022 To be selected as a reviewer, you must have published articles in peer-reviewed journals. The experience of publishing provides a reviewer with the basis for preparing a thorough, objective review.\u2022 To be selected, it is critical to be a regular reader of the five to six empirical journals that are most central to the area or journal for which you would like to review. Current knowledge of recently published research provides a reviewer with the knowledge base to evaluate a new submission within the context of existing research.\u2022 To select the appropriate reviewers for each manuscript, the editor needs detailed information. Please include with your letter your vita. In the letter, please identify which APA journal(s) you are interested in, and describe your area of expertise. Be as specific as possible. For example, \"social psychology\" is not sufficient-you would need to specify \"social cognition\" or \"attitude change\" as well.\u2022 Reviewing a manuscript takes time (1-4 hours per manuscript reviewed). If you are selected to review a manuscript, be prepared to invest the necessary time to evaluate the manuscript thoroughly.APA now has an online video course that provides guidance in reviewing manuscripts.
