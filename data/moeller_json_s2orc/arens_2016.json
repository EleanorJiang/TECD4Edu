In a sample of N \u00bc 4926 German students, math and language achievements were measured along with two facets of students' perceptions of the learning environment, i.e., perceived instructional quality of math and language classes and perceived relations to math and language teachers. In the GI/E path model, achievement and perceptions of the learning environment were positively related within matching domains but negatively related or unrelated across non-matching domains. This pattern of relations indicates that social and dimensional achievement comparisons contribute to the formation of students' perceptions of the learning environment but the pattern of relations was stronger for math than for language achievement. Students' perceptions of instructional quality were more strongly related to achievement than perceptions of studenteteacher relations. The findings were generalizable across same-aged elementary and secondary school students. The results are discussed regarding their implications for the proposed GI/E model and their importance for future research.",

Dimensional comparisons have gained prominence through the internal/external frames of reference (I/E) model (Marsh, 1986) . Given that the I/E model has been restricted to the effect of dimensional achievement comparisons on students' academic selfconcepts, the present study aims to investigate the potential operation of dimensional comparison processes in the formation of students' perceptions of the learning environment. This study thus contributes to contemporary theoretical advances based on the traditional I/E model and the subsequently established dimensional comparison theory (DCT, M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) which itself led to the generalized internal/external frames of reference (GI/E) model (M\u20ac oller, Helm, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, Nagy, & Marsh, 2015) .",

                "text": "The I/E model (Marsh, 1986) was originally established to provide a theoretical explanation for the found near-zero correlation between math and language self-concepts. Students' self-concept is conceptualized as students' self-perceptions of their own achievement. As math and language achievements were found to be highly related, math and language self-concepts were also assumed to be substantially related but negligible correlations were consistently found instead. According to the I/E model, the near-zero correlation between math and language self-concepts is explained by the simultaneous operation of social and dimensional comparisons for self-concept formation. Using an external frame of reference, students conduct social comparisons by comparing their achievement in one domain with their classmates' achievements in the same domain. For example, if a student's language achievement is lower than his/her classmates' language achievement, his/her language self-concept is also likely to be lower. By using an internal frame of reference, students conduct dimensional comparisons and compare their achievement in a given subject with their achievement in another subject. For example, if a student's language achievement is lower than his/her math achievement, his/her language self-concept will suffer but his/her math self-concept will benefit. The social comparison process is supposed to result in a positive correlation between math and language self-concepts while the dimensional comparison process is assumed to lead to a negative correlation. Hence, the simultaneous operation of both comparison processes in students' self-concept formation induces the observed negligible relation between math and language selfconcepts. Besides the low correlation between math and language self-concepts, the I/E model makes assumptions regarding the pattern of relations between achievement and self-concepts of matching and non-matching domains (Fig. 1a ). Interpreted as a result of social comparison processes, the relations between achievement and self-concept of matching domains (e.g., math achievement and math self-concept; the horizontal paths in Fig. 1a ) are supposed to be substantial and positive. Conversely, dimensional comparison processes are expected to invoke negative relations between achievements and self-concepts of non-matching domains (e.g., math achievement and language self-concept; the cross-paths in Fig. 1a ).",

The average correlation between math and language achievements was strongly positive (r \u00bc .67) and much higher than the average correlation between math and language self-concepts (r \u00bc .10). The four path coefficients illustrated the operation of social and dimensional comparison processes since the two horizontal paths relating math achievement and math self-concept (b \u00bc .61) and relating language achievement and language self-concept (b \u00bc .49) were substantial and positive, whereas the two cross-paths leading from language achievement to math self-concept (b \u00bc \u00c0.27) and from math achievement to language self-concept (b \u00bc \u00c0.21) were negative.",

It stimulated the recent establishment of DCT (M\u20ac oller et al., 2015; M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) which takes a broader perspective on dimensional comparisons and points to their antecedents, psychological processes and consequences. In DCT, dimensional comparisons are more generally defined as taking place when a person compares his/her perceptions of aspects of a particular domain A with his/her perceptions of aspects of a particular domain B, bearing consequences for any kind of outcomes related to these domains. Thus, whereas the original I/E model is restricted to math and language achievements as independent variables and math and language self-concepts as outcome variables, DCT opens its logic to a variety of other variables so that DCT has led to the development of the GI/E model (M\u20ac oller et al., 2015, Fig. 1b) . Using the original I/E model as a prototype, the GI/ E model assumes dimensional comparisons to become evident by negative or near-zero cross-domain relations between any kinds of independent and outcome variables.",

In a more rigorous approach, other variables than self-concept are applied as outcome variables in order to illustrate that social and dimensional comparison processes entail broader cognitive, affective, and motivational consequences. In this regard, the GI/E model assumptions were investigated with respect to self-regulated learning (Miller, 2000) , emotions (Goetz, Frenzel, Hall, & Pekrun, 2008) , intrinsic motivation , and interest (Schurtz, Pfost, Nagengast, & Artelt, 2014) .",

To our knowledge, no study has yet examined the potential operation of dimensional achievement comparisons in the formation of students' perceptions of their learning environment.

Positive studenteteacher relations are characterized by students' experience of teachers providing academic and socioemotional support to students, considering and meeting the students' needs, and pursuing an individually-orientated approach to the students (Birch & Ladd, 1998) . Positive studenteteacher relations have been consistently found to be related to a range of desirable student outcomes such as academic behavior (Furrer & Skinner, 2003; Hamre & Pianta, 2001; Hughes, Luo, Kwok, & Loyd, 2008) , social behavior (Howes, Hamilton, & Matheson, 1994) , or stress reactivity and well-being (Little & Kobak, 2003; Suldo et al., 2009) . Of particular relevance to the present study is the finding that positive studenteteacher relations also share positive relations to students' achievement (e.g., Furrer & Skinner, 2003; Hamre & Pianta, 2001; Hughes & Kwok, 2007; Pianta & Stuhlman, 2004; Spilt, Hughes, Wu, & Kwok, 2012) .",

Student-teacher relations have often not been measured related to a teacher for a specific subject but it has often remained unclear which teacher (e.g., students' math teacher or language teacher) is referred to (e.g., Birch & Ladd, 1997; Hughes, Cavell, & Willson, 2001 ). The application of such global measures, however, does not allow for an investigation of domain specificity in studenteteacher relations, thus to study whether students display differential perceptions regarding their math and language teachers. Moreover, the relation between studenteteacher relations and achievement has commonly been investigated by using global instead of domain-specific achievement indicators [students' average achievement drawn from math and language tests (e.g., Hughes & Kwok, 2007) , or average grades (e.g., Furrer & Skinner, 2003) ]. In this instance, it is not possible to examine whether dimensional achievement comparisons are at play in the formation of students' perceptions of studenteteacher relations. In the latter case, students' achievement would be positively linked to students' perceived relation to the teacher of the matching domain (i.e., students who achieve well in math would have a positive perception of the relation to their math teachers), but negatively related to students' perceived relation to the teacher of a non-matching domain (e.g., students who achieve well in math would have a less positive or even negative perception of the relation to their language teacher).",

Much research has focused on classroom management which is assumed to encompass different instructional aspects all ensuring students' time-on-task and classroom order (Evertson & Weinstein, 2006) . Within this multidimensional conceptualization of classroom management, some aspects target the clarity, structure, coherence and understandability, thus the quality of instruction (Seidel & Shavelson, 2007) . Instructional quality has often been found to be positively associated with students' achievement (Hattie, 2009; Seidel & Shavelson, 2007) . For instance, Seidel, Rimmele, and Prenzel (2005) demonstrated that coherence of physics lessons enhanced students' competence development in physics. Regarding math classes, cognitively activating instruction (i.e., providing students with math tasks demanding conceptual modeling, high levels of argumentation and translation processes, Kunter et al., 2013) as well as students' perceptions of rule clarity and teacher monitoring (Kunter & Baumert, 2006) have been shown to be positively related to students' math achievement, while students' perceptions of classroom chaos have been found to be negatively related to students' math achievement (Marsh et al., 2012) .",

This design is exceptional as studies commonly compare elementary and secondary school students who also differ in their age and grade level. This peculiarity is due to the fact that the present study draws on data gathered in the German federal state of Berlin. In the Berlin educational system, the majority of students change from elementary to secondary school after grade level 6 but a small number of students are eligible to transfer to secondary school already after grade level 4. The secondary schools offering an early transition after grade 4 belong to the high-ability (academic) track of the German secondary school system and are thus characterized by a high average level of student achievement. Furthermore, these schools have often developed specific profiles or programs (e.g., bilingual programs, physical education, music education) and are thus viewed as highly prestigious and high-achieving learning environments Baumert, Becker, Neumann, & Nikolova, 2009) . In light of these differences between the learning environments experienced by same-aged elementary and secondary school students in Berlin, it is interesting to explore whether the students differ in their relations between achievement and perceptions of the learning environment including the use of social and dimensional comparison processes.",

In essence, we analyze whether social and dimensional comparisons of math and language achievement play a role in the formation of students' perceptions of studenteteacher relations and instructional quality related to math and language classes. According to the central assumptions of the GI/E model, math and language achievements are assumed to be more highly correlated than students' perceptions of the learning environment related to math and language domains supporting the domain specificity of these perceptions. Due to social comparison processes, achievement is expected to be positively associated with students' perceptions of studenteteacher relations and instructional quality in the same domain. A student with good math (language) achievement is presumed to display positive perceptions of his/her relation to his/her math (language) teacher and of the instructional quality of his/her math (language) classes. Following dimensional comparisons, we assume negative relations between achievement and both facets of students' perceptions of the learning environment of non-matching domains. Students with identical math achievement should perceive the relation to their math teacher and the instructional quality of math classes more negatively when demonstrating higher levels of language achievement.",

Given that the German federal state of Berlin offers two pathways for the transition from elementary to secondary school (i.e., a commonly practiced transition between grade levels 6 and 7, and an early transition to the high-ability track of secondary schools after grade 4 for a minority of students, see above), the aim of the ELEMENT study was to examine and compare the development of cognitive (i.e., achievement) and non-cognitive outcomes (e.g., motivation) between the two groups of students across three measurement waves. The first measurement point took place at the end of grade 4 for students with a regular transition, but at the beginning of grade 5 for students with an early transition (thus, immediately after their transition to high-ability secondary schools).

Therefore, it is recommended to examine changes in the descriptive goodness-of-fit indices for judging invariance. According to the guidelines proposed by Cheung and Rensvold (2002) , invariance can be assumed as long as the CFI does not drop more than .01 between more and less restrictive models (also see Chen, 2007) . Hence, cut-off values for the various goodness-of-fit indices have been established to evaluate the fit of latent models including nested models. However, these cut-off values should serve as guidelines rather than being treated as \"golden rules\", and researchers are advised to substantiate their ultimate model evaluation by drawing on different types of information including the resulting parameter estimates, statistical conformity, and theoretical adequacy of the models .",

Students' academic self-concept might be supposed to mediate these relations. However, given its inconsistent relations to dimensions of students' perceptions of the learning environment (Arens, Morin, & Watermann, 2015; Marsh et al., 2012) , self-concept might be only one possible candidate and alternative mediator variables should be considered such as students' attributions for success and failure (Weiner, 1985) . Indeed, students' perceptions of accountability might be of high relevance to explain the present findings on relations between students' achievement and students' perceptions of the learning environment. For instance, a student who does well in math might hold the math teacher to account for the good math accomplishments which might lead to positive perceptions of the student's relations to the math teacher and to positive assessments of the teacher's given math instructions. In case of a student's relatively low level of language achievement, he/she might tend to at least partially attribute the poor performance to the language teacher's inadequate teaching (i.e., low perceptions of instructional quality) and insufficient support (i.e., a perceived negative relation to the language teacher).",

In this context, future research should examine even more outcome variables which might be influenced by dimensional comparison processes. On the other hand, an even more sophisticated and necessary approach would be to look at the independent variables. The classic I/E model has considered achievement [either in terms of school grades or standardized achievement test scores (M\u20ac oller et al., 2009) ] as the independent variable and academic selfconcept as the outcome variable. Existing extensions of the original I/E model that go beyond self-concept as an outcome variable (Goetz et al., 2008; Miller, 2000; Schurtz et al., 2014) including this study have still used achievement as the independent variable. Hence, future attempts should be made to investigate which variables besides achievement might also be subject to social and dimensional comparison processes (i.e., the question of what is compared, see the \"With What\" question in DCT M\u20ac oller & Marsh, 2013) . In this context, diary studies (M\u20ac oller & Husemann, 2006) revealed some first insights that individuals also tend to apply dimensional comparison processes to personality characteristics and physical attractiveness. In an experimental study, M\u20ac oller and Savyon (2003) manipulated intelligence as the independent variable by success or failure feedback on anagram tasks. People in the failure condition rated themselves as being more honest than did students who received positive feedback indicating dimensional comparisons in the relation between intelligence and honesty. Finally, to get complete sophisticated evidence of the GI/E model, the consideration of various independent and outcome variables should be complemented by different study designs including longitudinal studies to examine possible reciprocal relations between the variables (M\u20ac oller et al., 2011) , and experimental studies to make causal inferences.",
