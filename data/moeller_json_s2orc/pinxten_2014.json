Both internal and external comparisons are considered crucial antecedents: Students form their academic self-concept to a considerable extent by (externally) comparing themselves with others and by (internally) comparing their own performance in different academic domains. Building on previous research in secondary education, the main goal of this study is to test a model integrating both comparison processes in elementary education using a large sample of Grade 4 students (N = 4,436) nested in 241 classes. Including the proposed internal and external reference effects in one integrated model, the study provided evidence for the presence of both comparison effects on two academic self-concept domains (i.e., math and verbal self-concept). Specifically, students' achievement in one domain was positively related to self-concept in that domain and negatively related to self-concept in the other domain. Additionally, class-average achievement was negatively related to academic self-concept within each domain and positively across domains. In conclusion, this study stresses the need for further integration of the major models on academic self-concept formation in a unifying theoretical framework.",

                "text": "Academic self-concepts (ASCs) comprise mental representations of one's abilities in academic domains. Current models of ASC (e.g., Marsh/ Shavelson Model of Marsh, 1990a; nested Marsh/Shavelson Model of Brunner et al., 2010) differentiate between general ASC and domainspecific ASCs. While general ASC reflects an individual's evaluation of his or her academic abilities across subjects (\"I am good at most school subjects\"), domain-specific ASCs reflect an individual's impression of his or her ability in a specific academic domain, such as mathematics (\"I am good at mathematics\") or English (\"I am good at English\"). In the present study, we will focus on the domain-or course-specific level of ASC. ASC tends to be highly correlated with academic self-efficacy as one's confidence in successfully carrying out a specific academic task (Bong & Skaalvik, 2003; Ferla, Valcke, & Cai, 2009) . However, different from self-efficacy, ASC is more likely to be rooted in social comparisons. In judging one's ASC, individuals use the achievements of relevant others (in school, usually their classmates) as a frame of reference to evaluate their own achievement level (Seaton, Marsh, & Craven, 2010) . When evaluating one's efficacy at a particular task, however, individuals assess their chance of succeeding relative to the task at hand which reduces the influence of frame of reference effects (Seaton et al., 2010) .",

However, not only one's actual performance is considered to be of importance. Research has shown that comparisons are crucial antecedents of ASC (Huguet et al., 2009; Marsh & Martin, 2011; M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) . First, students conduct social comparisons and compare themselves with others (i.e., external comparisons). Depending on the achievement level of the respective comparison or reference group, the ASC of equally able students will vary (i.e., ASC decreases with an increasing achievement level of the reference group). Second, students compare their own achievements in different academic domains (i.e., internal comparisons) . That is, high achievement in one academic domain (e.g., mathematics) can exert a negative influence on the ASC in another academic domain (e.g., English) (for a meta-analysis see M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, K\u00f6ller, & Marsh, 2009) .",

Moreover, none of these studies investigated elementary school students. Yet, it has been suggested that external comparisons may be less important for younger children and that domain-specific self-concepts of younger children may be more strongly interrelated across different academic domains (Dijkstra, Kuyper, van der Werf, Buunk, & van der Zee, 2008; M\u00f6ller et al., 2009) . The present study aims to extend research by studying the complex interplay between internal and external comparisons on students' math and verbal self-concept in a large sample of elementary school students. The impact of internal comparisons on ASC is usually investigated in the internal/external frame of reference model (I/E Model; Marsh, 1986) , the impact of external comparisons or reference groups effects on ASC in the big-fishlittle-pond model (BFLP Model; Marsh, 1984) .

The common depiction of the I/E Model is presented in Fig. 1a .

As different academic subjects are often highly interrelated, selfconcepts across academic domains should be positively related (M\u00f6ller et al., 2009) . However, because internal comparisons are ipsative, an increase in self-concept in one domain should trigger a decrease in self-concept in another domain, which would entail a negative correlation between self-concepts across domains (Parker et al., 2013) . When combined, both processes then result in the observed close to zero correlations between self-concepts in different domains (Marsh, 1986) .",

M\u00f6ller et al. (2009) point at the diverse and sound empirical evidence supporting this model (i.e., experimental studies, longitudinal studies, introspective diary studies, and meta-analyses). Still, we noticed a few important limitations in research on the I/E model. First, as the name of the model suggests, the I/E Model also mentions external comparison processes as influencing students' ASC (Marsh, 1986) . However, both in its original depiction (Marsh, 1986, p. 134) and in later elaborations over the years (e.g., Marsh & Hau, 2004; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1995; Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002) , the social comparison or external component of the model was only implicitly assumed, but not actually modeled: the achievement level of classmates or schoolmates, for instance, was never included as an actual predictor. Second, studies with elementary school children are scarce. In the meta-analysis of M\u00f6ller et al. (2009) , only 10 of the 69 studies under consideration had participants with less than 6 years of schooling. Although the predictions of the I/E Model seemed to generalize over age groups, (positive) correlations between math and verbal self-concept were somewhat larger for younger (before Grade 7) than for older students (M\u00f6ller et al., 2009) . This might indicate weaker effects of internal comparisons (or weaker negative cross-domain effects) for elementary school students than for older students. ",

This negative effect has been found to be particularly robust across a wide range of individual and contextual characteristics, educational settings, and countries . Nevertheless, there are some pertinent gaps in BFLP research. (1) The large majority of BFLP studies tested the model premises within a single academic domain. As such, internal comparison processes across different academic domains (which are central in the I/E Model) were largely ignored. (2) With a few exceptions (e.g., K\u00f6ller et al., 2008; Thijs et al., 2010; Wouters et al., 2013) , BFLP studies have mainly focused on samples of secondary school students. It is widely accepted that with increasing age students become more susceptible to social comparison information as a means of self-evaluation (Dijkstra et al., 2008) .

Interestingly, the BFLP Model outlined above does empirically focus on this external component. Nevertheless, the BFLP Model and the I/E Model have been used and tested completely parallel to each other for many years. Therefore, we aim to integrate both models in one unifying model.

In his early studies, Marsh (1990b Marsh ( , 1994 included the effect of school-average achievement (i.e., the effects of external comparisons) into the I/E Model and found support for the predictions of both models -the I/E and the BFLP model. Thus, individual student achievement positively predicted self-concept in matching domains, individual student achievement negatively predicted self-concept in non-matching domains, and school-average achievement negatively predicted students' self-concept in matching domains. Although not predicted a priori, in both studies small positive crossdomain effects of school-average achievement on ASC were observed, meaning that school-average math achievement had a weak pos-itive effect on English self-concept and school-average English achievement had a weak positive effect on math self-concept. According to Marsh, these positive counterbalancing effects may mitigate some of the negative within-domain effects of the BFLP effect. However, these early studies examined these relations only at the student level. To test the central predictions of the BFLP Model, multilevel models that enable researchers to simultaneously test relationships at different levels of the data are needed (Parker et al., 2013) . For example, when testing the BFLP effect, researchers are interested in how class-or school-average achievement relates to individual students' ASC after having controlled for the relation of individual student achievement on individual students' ASC. That is, in Marsh' early studies, higher level predictors (i.e., the schoolaverage achievement variables) were not included at the appropriate level (i.e., the school level). Therefore, results of these early studies should be interpreted with caution.",

Using the TIMSS 2003 database, Chiu (2012) investigated the cross-national generalizability of the unifying model in the math and science domain in a large sample of Grade 8 students. In order to account for the complex structure of the data, the author used a three-level (students, schools, countries) hierarchical regression model. Chiu found strong support for the predictions of the unifying model across 27 countries. However, Chiu did not use a latent modeling approach, typically used when examining latent constructs such as ASC. Additionally, due to multicollinearity problems resulting from the extremely high correlation between school-average mathematics achievement and schoolaverage science achievement (r = .96), school-average achievement in both domains was not included in a single model. As a result, Chiu was unable to corroborate Marsh's (1990b Marsh's ( , 1994 findings regarding the positive compensatory paths (i.e., positive crossdomain effects of school-average achievement on ASC). In order to overcome this multicollinearity problem, Chiu recommended carefully selected sampling procedures in future models, for example, by only including participants with differential achievement profiles between two different domains (e.g., schools with gifted students in a particular domain versus schools with mixed ability students). Parker et al. (2013) explicitly addressed this recommendation of Chiu by comparing the results of the unifying model across two school types in the German school context. More specifically, the authors examined a large sample of final year students nested in 157 university track schools. In Germany, one distinguishes two types of schools within this university track: general (or traditional) and themed (or magnet) schools. Themed schools offer a specialized set of programs in one academic domain, preparing students for a career in this particular field/domain. Students are primarily selected based on a narrowly defined area of excellence (e.g., math or literature). In contrast, general schools are more selective in a way that students are selected on the basis of their general academic excellence (e.g., math and literature). As such, school-average achievement in the math and verbal domain were more differentiated in themed rather than in general schools (Parker et al., 2013) . More specifically, school-level correlations of .74 and .39 between both domains were observed in general and themed schools, respectively.",

We expected to find support for the BFLP effect in Grade 4: Individual math achievement has a positive effect on math selfconcept and, when controlling for this effect, class-average math achievement has a negative effect on math self-concept. The same pattern is expected for the verbal domain. 3. We expected that the central predictions of both the I/E Model and the BFLP Model would hold when both models are combined in the unifying model. The existence of positive crossdomain compensatory effects of class-average math achievement on verbal self-concept and of class-average verbal achievement on math self-concept was explored in this unifying model because the research base is too weak to justify a priori hypotheses. 4. We also had some additional hypotheses on the correlations between our main variables. In line with previous research (e.g., Parker et al., 2013) , we expected significant positive correlations between verbal and math achievement at both the individual and the group level. Additionally, based on previous research (see M\u00f6ller et al., 2009) , we expected no significant or only a small positive correlation between verbal and math self-concept.",

In the present study, data were analyzed when students were in Grade 4 (4436 students in 241 classes; on average 18.4 students per class). 2 In this large-scale quasi-representative sample, boys and girls were equally distributed (50%-50%).

To measure spelling, students were given a dictation consisting of monosyllabic and polysyllabic words wherein a number of specific aspects of Dutch spelling were tested (e.g., open versus closed syllable). In Grade 4, the more difficult B-version of the SVS-V was administered to all students. To measure reading comprehension, students were given a few short texts to read, after which they had to answer several multiple choice questions concerning this text. Students' math achievement was measured by means of a curriculum relevant standardized multiple choice test covering five domains: mental arithmetic, arithmetic, algebraic problems, geometry, and applied arithmetic. For the reading comprehension and math test, an A-version and a B-version were administered to low-and highperforming students, respectively (this assignment was based on students' test results in Grade 3). A calibration procedure using item response theory (IRT) techniques was administered in advance to enable comparison across test versions and time. Reliabilities of all achievement tests were good (Cronbach's alphas ranging between .85 and .90). To create one global score for Dutch (language) achievement, we calculated the average of the spelling and reading comprehension test scores and continued the analyses with this composite variable (if one of the two scores was missing, the value for the composite variable was also missing). Dutch achievement data were missing in 2% of the cases and math achievement data were missing in 1% of the cases.",

Students nested within a higher level unit (classes or schools) tend to be more similar to each other than to students in other classes or schools.

A substantial drawback associated with the clustering of students within schools is that the straightforward calculation of school level (Level 2) variables, as an aggregation of individual students (Level 1) scores, is likely to be affected by sampling bias because generally only a subset of Level 1 units is used. Complex latent aggregation approaches (Marsh et al., 2009) have been proposed to resolve this issue. However, because entire classes were considered in our study, we had measures available for almost every student in class. As a consequence, the sampling bias outlined above does not apply to the current research. In other words, given that only 1-2% of the Dutch and math achievement data were missing, we feel confident that we managed to calculate accurate class-level achievement variables with virtually no sampling bias, thus eliminating the need for latent aggregation. Additionally, we were not able to consider both the class and the school level in the context of the present study because many Flemish elementary schools only have one single class per grade. In accordance with findings of other studies (e.g., Marsh et al., 2005 ), ICC's for math and Dutch self-concept at the class level were small (ranging from .002 to .045).",

A failure to simultaneously control for measurement error hinders unbiased parameter estimation. More recent statistical packages such as Mplus version 6.1 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998 -2010 ) enable researchers to estimate multilevel models while simultaneously controlling for measurement error (see L\u00fcdtke et al., 2008 and Marsh et al., 2009 for more information on these kinds of models and their specifics). Standard fit indices were used to evaluate all models. For good fit, the chi square statistic should be as small as possible, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) less than or equal to .06, the Comparative Fit Index (CFA) and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) equal to or larger than .95 (Hu & Bentler, 1999) . As the chi square statistic seems particularly sensitive to large sample sizes (Byrne, 2012; Vandenberg & Lance, 2000) , we will only reject models with significant p-values for the chi square if the other fit indices indicate poor model fit as well.

Up to now, internal and external comparison processes influencing academic self-concept have scarcely been examined together in elementary education. The present study aimed to fill this research gap. Based on the predictions of the I/E Model and the BFLP Model, we tested a unifying model in which the effects of individual student achievement and class-average achievement in both the math and verbal domain were simultaneously modeled. Our findings demonstrate that the combination of the I/E and the BFLP model in one unifying model gives us a better understanding of elementary school students' ASC than each model alone because it adds incremental predictive validity to the explanation of variability in academic self-concepts in elementary school students. Even after controlling for the effects of internal comparison processes, external comparison processes were still related to academic selfconcept and vice versa. In comparing the effect sizes of the results of the I/E Model and the BFLP Model separately with the effect sizes of the revisited model, I/E and BFLP effects were quite stable across models. This further supports the statement that both models uniquely predict academic self-concept variability. Therefore, their combination into one model leads to a better explanation -in terms of explained variability and parsimony -of academic self-concept formation than both single models.",

The Revisited I/E Model further indicated that when class-average achievement in both domains was considered simultaneously, classaverage math and verbal achievement were strongly negatively related to academic self-concept within domains, as would be expected from within the BFLP Model. Additionally, we found some support for the existence of the positive cross-domain compensatory effects of groupaverage achievement that were observed by Parker et al. (2013) in themed secondary schools. Nevertheless, class-average verbal/ math achievement only had a small beneficial effect on students' math/verbal self-concept in our study. Positive compensatory crossdomain effects of group-average achievement variables thus seem to be of larger importance when there is more differentiation between the achievement domains under consideration (the correlation between both group-average achievement variables for themed schools in the Parker et al., 2013 study was .39, whereas this correlation was .72 in our study).",

The small size suggests that elementary school students are already able to identify themselves in differentiated terms although there seems to be less differentiation than in older students. Parker et al. (2013) , for instance, reported small negative correlations between the math and verbal self-concept of upper secondary students. Importantly, we found strong evidence for a BFLP effect of class-average achievement on academic selfconcept in Grade 4 students. In line with previous BFLP studies with elementary school students and class as a frame of reference (e.g., K\u00f6ller et al., 2008; Thijs et al., 2010) , this suggests that social comparisons already play an important role in how younger students view themselves in the academic domain.",

                "text": "The present study also had some limitations which may inspire future research. First, our data were cross-sectional. The BFLP Model and the classic I/E Model are typically only tested on the basis of a single cross-sectional wave of data, but the Reciprocal Effects Model (REM) describes how the associations between prior academic selfconcept and subsequent achievement (and vice versa) longitudinally develop over time. A pertinent issue for further research is thus how to integrate the premises of the REM into the Revisited I/E Model. More recently, M\u00f6ller, Retelsdorf, K\u00f6ller, and Marsh (2011) as well as Niepel, Brunner, and Preckel (2014) already showed that the central predictions of the classic I/E Model hold when longitudinally modeled. As students often compare themselves with different groups over time, complex cross-classification analytical approaches will be required or meaningful subgroups will need to be identified (i.e., students in stable versus changing compositions). Second, although we hypothesized that our results occurred because of internal and external comparison processes, we did not observe these processes directly in the present study. Future studies thus may benefit from using qualitative methods assessing more explicitly how students experience their academic context and how they construe their academic self-concept. Finally, we specifically considered the effect of class-average achievement in Flemish elementary schools. As such, more research is needed to establish whether our results may be replicated in other elementary school systems across different countries and cultures (and with, for example, other relevant reference frames).",

                "text": "Nevertheless, our study has some important implications. First, our findings imply that the Revisited I/E model for ASC formation encompassing both internal and external comparison processes should be favored instead of two separate models each focusing on one type of process. The present study thereby also highlights the need for further integration with other important frameworks, such as the REM (see above). Furthermore, our results suggest that teacher, educators, and other professionals in the school context should be made aware that even younger students in elementary schools are making both internal and external comparisons to form their ASC. Due to internal comparisons, students, who are exceptionally good in math, may underestimate themselves in Dutch and vice versa. Due to external comparisons, equally able students may have different views of themselves as learners according to the achievement level of their class group. These effects may even be reinforced by the teacher who may also be influenced by the class-average achievement level (Baudson, Fischbach, & Preckel, 2015; Trautwein & Baeriswyl, 2007) . In sum, this study extends research by empirically combining the I/E Model and the BFLP Model on academic self-concept formation in a sample of elementary school students. The revisited model shows more specifically that internal comparison processes, resulting in negative cross-domain effects of individual achievement on academic self-concept, go hand in hand with external comparison processes, resulting in positive effects of individual achievement and negative effects of class-average achievement within a domain on academic self-concept.",
