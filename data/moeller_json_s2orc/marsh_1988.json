    "abstract": "Academic self-concept, originally posited by Shavelson as a single higher-order facet, was found by Marsh and Shavelson to comprise at least two higher-order academic facets (verbal and math). Marsh developed the internal/external (I/E) frame of reference model to account for the extreme separation of math and verbal self-concepts and their relations to math and verbal achievements. In our investigation, students completed the academic self-concept scales from three different instruments that were the basis of two studies. In the first study, the two higher order academic factors posited by Marsh and Shavelson fit the data substantially better than did a single higher order facet. In subsequent discussion, the Marsh/Shavelson model is more clearly defined, and directions for further research are identified. The second study provided further support for the I/E frame of reference model in that (a) verbal and math self-concepts were nearly uncorrelated, (b) verbal achievement positively affected verbal self-concept but negatively affected math selfconcept (i.e., higher verbal skills led to lower math self-concepts), (c) math achievement positively affected math self-concept but negatively affected verbal self-concept, and (d) the results were consistent for each of three self-concept instruments. Both studies demonstrate that in further research at least verbal and math self-concepts, rather than a single general facet of academic self-concepts, should be considered. Shavelson, Hubner, and Stanton (1976) posited self-concept to be a multifaceted, hierarchical construct. They presented a possible representation of this hierarchy in which general selfconcept appeared at the apex and was divided into academic and nonacademic self-concepts.

This led to a revision of the model. Of particular relevance to our investigation was that verbal and math self-concepts were nearly uncorrelated and did not combine with school self-concept to form a single, second-order academic factor. Instead, the results argued for two second-order academic factors representing verbal/academic and math/academic self-concepts. In subsequent research with late-adolescent responses to the Self Description Questionnaire III (SDQIII; Marsh, 1987, in press) , verbal and math self-concepts were again relatively uncorrelated with each other and could not be adequately explained by a single higher order academic factor. The purpose of Study 1 is to apply hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis to test the generality of the Marsh/Shavelson revision across responses by North Americans to the SDQIII and to two additional self-concept instruments.",

In support of the construct validity of a multifaceted self-concept, researchers have found (a) academic achievement to be more highly correlated with academic self-concept than with nonacademic and general self-concepts (Byrne, 1984) and (b) achievement in particular content areas to be more highly correlated with self-concepts in the matching content areas (Marsh, 1986b) . This research also reveals, however, that different facets of academic self-concept are much more distinct than are the corresponding areas of academic achievement. Marsh (1986b) proposed the I/E frame of reference model to describe why verbal and math self-concepts are so distinct from each other and so content specific in their relations to verbal and math achievements. The purpose of Study 2 is to replicate and extend the support for this model and to examine new substantively related issues.",

Hence this external comparison process should lead to a positive correlation between verbal self-concept and math self-concept, as originally anticipated in Shavelson et al.'s (1976) model. The internal comparison process, though more unusual in other theoretical accounts, is like the compensatory model described by Byrne (1984) and by Winne and Marx (1981) . Because math achievement and verbal achievement are compared with each other, it is the difference between the two that contributes to a high self-concept in one area or the other. Hence the internal process should lead to a negative correlation between verbal self-concept and math self-concept. The joint operation of both processes, depending on the relative strength of each, will lead to the near-zero correlations that have been observed in empirical research.",

Academic achievements are hypothesized to be a determinant of academic self-concepts. This does not argue, however, against a more dynamic model in which subsequent levels of academic achievement and self-concept are determined by prior levels of achievement and self-concept. According to the I/E model, (a) verbal and math achievements are highly correlated, (b) verbal and math self-concepts are nearly uncorrelated or at least are substantially less correlated than verbal and math achievements, (c) verbal achievement has a strong, positive direct effect on verbal self-concept but a weaker, negative direct effect on math self-concept, and (d) math achievement has a strong positive effect on math self-concept but a weaker, negative effect on verbal self-concept. Marsh (1986b) focused on two sources of evidence to support the I/E model. First, he reported correlations between math self-concept and verbal self-concept that were based on responses to SDQ instruments from 11 studies that spanned the preadolescent to early-adulthood period. Except for the youngest children, those in second and third grades, the correlations were consistently close to zero. Next, he tested the models' predictions with data from six of the studies that also had math and verbal achievement scores. These results demonstrated that the direct effects of math achievement on verbal self-concept and of verbal achievement on math selfconcept were consistently negative. In discussing the research, however, Marsh noted that \"because all the studies were based on responses by Australians to one of the three SDQ instruments, the generalizability of the model should be tested with other instruments and different groups of subjects\" (p. 146).",

Incorporating a sex variable into the I/E model also provides a new approach to the study of sex differences in self-concept. Historically, self-concept researchers have frequently examined sex differences in general self-concept (Wylie, 1979) , and more recently researchers have shown that sex differences vary systematically with the particular facet of self-concept (e.g., Byrne & Shavelson, 1986 , 1987 Marsh, Barnes, Cairns, & Tidman, 1984; Marsh, Parker, & Barnes, 1985) . Furthermore, the relation between sex differences in academic achievement and those in self-concept is particularly relevant to such current concerns as the performance of women in mathematics (e.g., Meece, Parsons, Kaczala, Goff, & Futterman, 1982; Pallas & Alexander, 1983) . Marsh, Smith, and Barnes (1985) found that fifth-grade girls had lower math self-concepts than did boys, even though their mathematics performance was better (on standardized tests and according to teacher ratings). Placing their research in the context of other findings (e.g., Meece et al., 1982) , they suggested that math self-concept for girls dropped in relation to that of boys before the corresponding drop in math achievement. This suggested that math self-concept may have a causal role in the subsequent decline in math achievement. In the same study, boys had lower scores for verbal achievement and verbal self-concept, but the sex difference in verbal selfconcept could be explained in terms of boys' lower verbal achievement.",

Because sex stereotypes suggest that girls have better verbal achievement than do boys, their verbal self-concept may be even higher than can be explained by objective achievement differences. Likewise, because sex stereotypes suggest the boys have better math achievement than do girls, their math self-concept may be even higher than can be explained by objective achievement differences. In particular, if stereotyped sex differences in math self-concept favoring boys and in verbal self-concept favoring girls are larger than can be explained by corresponding sex differences in math and verbal achievements, then these sex differences in academic self-concept may causally affect subsequent academic performance. This self-fulfilling prophecy could occur directly through the impact of selfconcept on subsequent academic performance or indirectly through its effect on other variables such as course selection. Hence the inclusion of a sex variable in the I/E model may contribute to understanding sex differences in specific areas of achievement, in specific facets of self-concept, and the relation between the two sets of sex differences. ments. Study 2 also extended the original I/E model in that new variables of school self-concept, general self-concept, school achievement, and gender were added. As well as having potential theoretical relevance to the I/E model, relations involving each of these additional variables are substantially important to issues such as sex differences. The inclusion of these new variables and the use of three different self-concept instruments also provide a powerful test of the construct validity of the specific facets of academic self-concept.",

School grades for mathematics, English, and all school subjects were used as indicators of math, verbal, and school achievements, respectively. The sample, procedures, and instrumentation are described in more detail by Shavelson (1986, 1987) . Subjects were 516 boys and 475 girls who attended Grades 11 or 12 in two coeducational high schools in suburban Ottawa, Canada. Verbal, math, and school self-concepts were each measured with the SDQIII (Marsh, Barnes & Hocevar, 1985; Marsh & O'Neill, 1984; Marsh, Richards, & Barnes, 1986 ), the Self-Concept of Ability Scale (SCA; Brookover, 1962; Shavelson & Bolus, 1982) , and the Affective Perception Inventory (API; Soares & Soares, 1979) . General self-concept was measured with the SDQIII, the API, and the Self-Esteem Scales (SES; Rosenberg, 1965) . Students responded to a total of 165 items that constituted these twelve scales; response scales consisted of eight SDQIII, four API, four SES, or five SCA response categories. In addition to responses to these self-concept scales, school grades were available for each student in English, in mathematics, and across all school subjects. These grades represented teachers' cumulative assessments of classroom work that were reported on report cards. For both Studies 1 and 2 we constructed correlation matrices based on these variables in which we used listwise deletion for missing variables.",

Models 1 and 1A each posited 9 first-order factors and no higher order factors, but they differed in that correlations among the 9 factors were freely estimated in Model 1 but fixed to be zero in Model 1A. One, two, and three higher order factors were posited to explain correlations among first-order factors in Models 2, 3, and 4, respectively (see Figure 2 ). In Model 3A the correlation between the two higher order factors was fixed to be zero, and in Model 3B the same content factors from the different instruments were required to have the same factor loading on each of the higher order factors.",

The higher order models differed substantially in their ability to fit the data. Whereas Model 2 provided a relatively poorer fit (TLI = .80), Models 3 and 4 differed only modestly in their ability to fit the data (TLIs = .90 and .91, respectively). Higher order factor loadings and factor correlations for both Models 3 and 4 ( Figure  1 ) supported the interpretation of the posited factors. In Model 3 both higher order factors were well defined, but the correlation between these math/academic and verbal/academic factors was not significantly different from zero. Model 4 provided a slightly better fit to the data than did Model 3, hut the difference was small and complicated by the fact that the two models were not nested. The major focus of this investigation was on the relative ability of one general academic ability factor (Model 2) and two higher order factors (Model 3) to explain correlations among the first-order factors. For this comparison, Model 3 was clearly superior.",

In accordance with the nonsignificant correlation in Model 3, the fit of Model 3A did not differ significantly from Model 3. In Model 3B the higher order factor loadings of the first-order factors representing the same self-concept facet were constrained to be equal. For example, the verbal models are a priori false and will necessarily be rejected if the sample size is sufficiently large. Although many subjective indicators of fit have been devised to determine whether goodness of fit is adequate, most are substantially influenced by sample size or do not provide an adequate correction for capitalizing on chance when the number of parameters is increased. Marsh, McDonald, and Balla (1987) found that of the commonly used indices of fit, only the Tucker-Lewis Index was relatively unaffected by sample size and appropriately corrected for the inclusion of addition parameters. Hence we used it to assess fit in this investigation. self-concept factors measured with the SDQIII, the API, and the SCA instruments were constrained so that each had the same factor loading on the higher order verbal factor. Because the fit of Model 3B did not differ significantly from Model 3A, there was strong support for the generality of the results across the three instruments.",

Because previous research has generally shown that girls have lower math self-concepts and math achievements by the end of high school, Marsh, Smith, and Barnes interpreted their results to indicate that girls' math self-concepts dropped before their math achievement. Whereas such an explanation was plausible for 5th graders, it does not seem reasonable for 1 lth and 12th graders. Marsh, Smith, and Barnes also suggested the possibility that sex stereotypes influence achievement indirectly through their influence on corresponding self-concepts, and this suggestion may be plausible in our investigation. However, support for such a suggestion will be difficult to establish because of the methodological problems in trying to establish the causal ordering of academic self-concept and academic achievement (see Byrne, 1984 Byrne, , 1986 . Pallas and Alexander (1983) also found that girls had slightly higher grades in math courses than boys. In their study, however, girls tended to take less advanced courses than boys and subsequently performed somewhat more poorly on the math section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Pallas and Alexander further suggested that differential socialization processes for boys and girls may account for the differential course selection. To the extent that differential socialization processes operate through selfconcept, their suggestion may also be consistent with suggestions by Marsh, Smith, and Barnes (1985) .",

                "text": "The lack of correlation between math self-concept and verbal self-concept is the strongest basis of support for the Marsh/Shavelson revision. Nevertheless, this support comes primarily from correlational studies that were based on responses to highly structured instruments collected at a single time. Further research is needed to examine these relations (a) in experimental or quasi-experimental designs (though we are generally suspicious of \"one-shot\" laboratory manipula-tions that are claimed to alter self-concept); (b) longitudinally, with powerful covariance structure modeling (e.g., Byrne, 1986; Shavelson & Bolus, 1982) ; and (c) with data collection procedures that allow subjects to form their own structure as with the repertory grid technique (e.g., Bannister & Nair, 1968) , instead of imposing on them the structure implicit in the design of the self-concept instrument. Figure 3b also suggests additional research questions that have theoretical and practical significance. If specific facets of academic self-concept besides verbal and math self-concepts can be adequately explained in terms of the two higher order constructs, then it may be sufficient to evaluate contentspecific interventions in terms of just these two higher order factors. If, however, specific facets of academic self-concept have unique, reliable variance that cannot be explained by the two higher order constructs, then it may be necessary to evaluate academic interventions with specific facets of academic self-concept that parallel the content of the intervention. Also, Shavelson et al.'s (1976) model posits that specific facets of self-concept become more differentiated with age. Whereas found support for this contention when both academic and nonacademic facets of self were considered, Marsh (1986b) found the lack of correlation between math self-concept and verbal self-concept to generalize across a wide age range. In terms of Figure 3b , this suggests that the two higher order constructs may be uncorrelated across a wide variety of ages but that there may be more unique variance in the lower order factors that cannot be explained by the two higher order factors for older respondents. No matter what the eventual outcome of empirical studies of the model in Figure 3B , we recommend that researchers include at least verbal and math self-concept as measures of academic self-concept. Because math and verbal self-concepts are so clearly differentiated, it may be inappropriate to infer academic self-concept on the basis of a single scale such as school self-concept (see the following discussion). Even when the intended effect of an academic intervention is specific to either verbal or math self-concept, the inclusion of the other serves as a relevant placebo control.",

Historically, to the extent that academic and nonacademic self-concept were even distinguished, a general academic self-concept (i.e., school selfconcept), instead of specific academic facets, was emphasized. Specific facets of academic self-concept were relegated to a relatively minor role except in research that focused on one particular facet of academic self-concept. School self-concept is a different kind of construct than the more specific facets in Figure 3b in that it is much broader. Its inclusion in Figure  3b is apparently justified because it marks the midpoint of our continuum and also because it has traditionally been the only indicator of academic self-concept. Our results suggest that most of the reliable variance in school self-concept can be incorporated into the two hierarchical facets but that there is also a small amount of unique variance that cannot. This unique variance might represent the influence of social aspects of school (peer relations, extracurricular activities, etc.) or the influence of other courses (art, music, physical education, industrial arts, home economics, etc.) that might not be explained by the two hierarchical facets. Marsh (1986a) described five operational definitions of general self-concept that can also be applied to general academic self-concept: (a) a hierarchical general academic selfconcept such as what appears at the apex of Figure 3a; (b) scales like school self-concept scales that are relatively unidimensional, are relatively content free, and typically could be reworded so as to apply to specific academic facets like those considered here; (c) an aggregate academic self-concept based on a collection of academic-related self-report items that typically confound specific and general components; (d) a discrepancy general academic self-concept that is based on the difference between ratings of specific facets (actual ratings) and ideal ratings; and (e) a weighted-average, general academic self-concept in which specific facets are weighted according to their salience, value, or importance. Shavelson et al. (1976) originally posited a hierarchical general academic self-concept and did not consider other definitions of general academic self-concept. Whereas a single hierarchical factor is apparently inadequate, the two hierarchical facets posited in Figure 3b may suffice. Figure 3b has the further advantage of incorporating both school self-concept and hierarchical factors into the same theoretical model. The aggregate form of general academic self-concept is theoretically and empirically weak, and its continued use is not recommended. Although the discrepancy and weighted-average approaches have been used to define general self-concept, technical problems hinder their application, and they apparently have not been used in academic self-concept research.",

If the role of academic self-concept research is to better understand the complexity of the self in an academic context, to predict academic behaviors and accomplishments, to provide outcome measures for academic interventions, and to relate academic self-concept to other constructs, then the specific facets of academic self-concept are more useful than a general facet.

Marsh (1986b) noted three directions for further research with the I/E model. The most immediate was the need to replicate the findings with responses by non-Australians and with different self-concept instruments. In this investigation, we fulfilled this need. Second, he noted that support for the two processes comes primarily from interpretations of correlational data and that experimental and introspective evidence is needed to further support their existence. Third, even though academic achievement and academic self-concepts are emphasized in the I/E model, it is likely that similar processes are involved in the formation of self-concepts in other areas, as suggested by Winne and Marx (1981) .

These findings demonstrate that the academic self-concepts are more complex than a mere subjective reflection of normatively defined academic achievements and that academic self-concepts are affected by processes different from those affecting the corresponding achievements. In this respect, even though academic self-concept and achievement are positively correlated, academic achievement is a biased indicator of academic self-concept, and academic self-concept is a biased indicator of academic achievement.",

There are, however, practical implications of this research for the classroom teacher as well. Even though classroom teachers are able to infer the academic self-concepts of their students with a reasonable degree of accuracy, there are systematic biases in their inferences (Marsh, 1986b) . In particular, it appears that teachers* inferences of students' academic self-concepts reflect primarily teachers' perceptions of students' academic achievement. In other words, teachers' inferences reflect primarily the external process but not the internal process embodied in the I/E model, and they do not adequately represent the extreme separation of different academic self-concept facets. Whereas teachers infer that bright students have consistently high self-concepts across all academic facets, these students may have only average or even below-average academic self-concepts in their (relatively) poorest subjects. Whereas teachers infer that poor students have consistently poor self-concepts across all academic facets, these students may have average or even above-average selfconcepts in their (relatively) best subjects. A better understanding of these processes may enable teachers to better motivate students and provide credible reinforcement to students from different ability levels.",
