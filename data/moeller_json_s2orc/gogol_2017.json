In the present study, we developed and investigated an integrative model that yields new insights concerning the generality and school-subject-specificity of affective-motivational constructs. To this end, we first examined structural models that could account for the hierarchical and subject-specific nature of academic self-concept, anxiety, and interest, respectively. In a second step, we combined these construct-specific models to investigate an integrative model that was able to simultaneously address between-and within-subject relations. We used data from four large-scale samples of ninth-graders (N = 866-6146) on academic self-concept, interest, and anxiety in three subjects (mathematics, French, and German). Our results underscored the importance of the components at the more global level: The major part of reliable individual differences in subject-specific measures of affective-motivational constructs and their relations to achievement indicators (grades and standardized test scores) was explained by the general components of the affective-motivational constructs and the global affective-motivational appraisals of specific subjects rather than by the construct-and-subject-specific components. Overall, the structural architecture of the integrative model provides a way to simultaneously analyze complex within-and between-subject relations of affective-motivational constructs.",

Empirical research on students' motivation and affect, however, appears to be fragmented, and thus, an integrative approach is needed for two reasons: First, research on motivation and research on affect have remained relatively independent in educational science. Yet, for several reasons, an integrative approach seems highly warranted. (a) Some constructs simultaneously target objects in research on affect and in research on motivation. For example, students' academic interests have been researched in both research traditions. (b) Some scholars have proposed comprehensive theoretical frameworks that cover motivational and affective constructs as well as their conceptual overlap and interrelations, for example, the expectancy-value theory (EVT) by Eccles (Parsons) and her colleagues (1983) or Pekrun's control-value theory (CVT; 2006) of achievement emotions. (c) Previous empirical studies have shown strong relations between affective and motivational constructs (e.g., Goetz, Cronjaeger, Frenzel, L\u00fcdtke, & Hall, 2010; Green, Martin, & Marsh, 2007) .",

The choice of these constructs is also important from the integrative perspective of our study: Whereas academic self-concept can be seen as a central construct in motivational research, and academic anxiety is the most investigated emotion in research on academic affect, interest cannot be uniquely assigned to either of these two research traditions and can be seen as a point of intersection as it includes both motivational and affective characteristics (see above).",

Although interest was a neglected research topic in the behaviorism-dominated research phase in psychology and also in the period that followed, it experienced a revival through Schiefele's (1978) work and in the research that followed his work (e.g., Hidi, 1990; Krapp, 1992; Renninger & Wozniak, 1985; Todt & Schreiber, 1998) . The modern theories on interest differentiate between individual interest (i.e., a relatively enduring disposition to prefer a certain subject) and situational interest (i.e., temporal attention or a state of being interested that is aroused by a specific topic or task; see Krapp, 1999; Renninger, 2000; Schiefele, 2001; Schiefele, 2009) . In the present study, we focus on the individual interest of adolescents in school. It is important to note that academic interest has been shown to be vitally relevant to academic choices (e.g., K\u00f6ller, Baumert, & Schnabel, 2001; Nagy et al., 2006; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) . Moreover, academic interest has been shown to be positively associated with academic effort, quality of learning, and level of achievement (e.g., Denissen, Zarrett, & Eccles, 2007; Schiefele, 1996; Schiefele, Krapp, & Winteler, 1992; Trautwein et al., 2015; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) .",

In the educational context, the concept of anxiety has been the focus of extensive research that was initiated by Sarason and Mandler (1952) in the early 1950s. Reports of academic anxiety may refer to the momentary state of anxiety or to the dispositional trait (cf. Goetz, Bieg, L\u00fcdtke, Pekrun, & Hall, 2013) . In the present paper, we focus on the trait level. Strong empirical evidence is available with regard to the relations between academic anxiety and other important student characteristics such as academic performance (Hembree, 1988; Hembree, 1990; Ma, 1999; Seipp, 1991) or socio-affective variables such as subjective well-being and psychological health (Diener, 1984) .",

(a) The within-subject approach targets relations across different affective-motivational constructs within a specific subject (or at the general level of the constructs 3 ; see Fig. 1a ). (b) The between-subject approach targets relations between different subject-specific components of a certain construct as well as relations between its general 4 and subjectspecific components (see Fig. 1b ). This approach addresses questions 2 Please note that the term ''subject\" is used throughout this study instead of the more precise term ''school subject\" to aid the clarity of the presentation. 3 Although the relations between different constructs at the general level do not belong to the strict interpretation of the within-subject approach, we assigned these relations to this approach to preserve the clarity of the structure of the manuscript. 4 The issue of the hierarchical structure of a certain construct (in terms of relations between the general and subject-specific components of the construct) can be considered a facet of the between-subject approach. Please note that in the present study, we measured the general component of each construct directly with corresponding items (e.g., ''I am good at most school subjects\"; see Table A1 in Appendix A). In doing so, our approach diverges somewhat from other research that has applied a between-subject approach where the general level of a construct was inferred from aggregating the subject-specific measures across different school subjects (see, e.g., Fig. 1C in Bong, 2001 ).",

For example, the broad theoretical framework of the EVT (Eccles [Parsons] et al., 1983 , Wigfield & Eccles, 2000 predicts relations between different affective-motivational constructs: academic self-concept is a key component of expectancy beliefs, whereas interest (as a combination of intrinsic and attainment values) and anxiety (as negative emotional cost when engaging in an academic activity) are vital parts of the value belief system where anxiety has been considered to be part of the cost component within value beliefs (Eccles & Wigfield, 2002, p. 120) . It is important to mention that the theory predicts that the perceptions of one's competence are related to one's value beliefs (i.e., interest and anxiety). Further, both interest and anxiety represent value components, which could suggest their interrelation. Similarly, Pekrun's (2006) control-value theory predicts mutual relations between these affective-motivational constructs. For example, appraisals of control (including ability self-concepts) and subjective values (including interests) are both specified as antecedents of academic emotions (including academic anxiety). Academic emotions, in turn, influence the appraisals of control and subjective values.",

                "text": "Much research has been devoted to the structural conceptualization of academic self-concept across different school subjects (e.g., Brunner et al., 2009; Brunner et al., 2010; Marsh, 1990; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985; Marsh, Smith, & Barnes, 1985) . Current academic self-concept models (see Brunner et al., 2010; Marsh, 1990 ) conceive of academic self-concept as a construct that is both (a) multidimensional in nature and (b) hierarchically structured. Many studies have found strong empirical support for the multidimensionality of self-concept with regard to specific subjects (e.g., Brunner et al., 2010; Marsh, 1990; Marsh, 1993; Marsh et al., 1988; M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001) . Regarding the hierarchical organization, general academic self-concept was originally conceived as operating at the apex of the hierarchy (Brunner et al., 2009; Brunner et al., 2010; Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976) , but earlier research failed to confirm this theoretical prediction (e.g., Marsh, 1990) . Nevertheless, it is a replicated finding that general academic self-concept is positively correlated with subject-specific self-concepts (e.g., Marsh, 1990; Marsh et al., 1988) , and this finding supports the idea that general academic self-concept is at the highest hierarchical level (see Brunner et al., 2010) . The Nested Marsh/Shavelson model (Brunner, L\u00fcdtke, & Trautwein, 2008; Brunner et al., 2010) as depicted in Fig. 2c was developed to formally represent and test the hierarchical structure of academic self-concept (e.g., for different cultures; Brunner et al., 2009) . Specifically, this model includes a general academic self-concept (SC_A b ) factor as the model's most general construct, which directly influences the general and subject-specific measures of academic self-concept. This is consistent with the idea that SC_A b operates at the apex of the hierarchy of academic self-concepts. Further, latent variables that represent academic self-concepts specific to different subjects (e.g., specific mathematics selfconcept [SC_M b ] , specific French self-concept [SC_F b ], and specific German self-concept [SC_G b ]) influence corresponding measures of subject-specific self-concepts independently of SC_A b . Note that the factors representing subject-specific self-concepts are nested within the general factor representing SC_A b . Such a structural model is therefore often referred to as a nested-factor model (Gustafsson & Balke, 1993) . This model is also referred to as the bifactor model in the literature (Chen, West, & Sousa, 2006) .",

This finding has also been interpreted as indicating a strong separation of self-concepts across subjects (Marsh & Hau, 2004) . Relative to academic self-concepts, there has been little research on the hierarchical characteristics of academic interest and academic anxiety. Regarding academic interest, general and subject-specific conceptualizations seem to coexist. Several scholars see academic interest as strongly subject-specific (e.g., Hidi & Renninger, 2006; Krapp, 2002; Schiefele, 1991) . Some researchers even claim that there is no such thing as general student interest (e.g., Frenzel, Goetz, Pekrun, Watt, 2010, p. 509) . This view is supported by empirical studies that have shown that measures of academic interest and closely related constructs such as the value construct (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) , academic enjoyment (Goetz et al., 2007) , or intrinsic motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2002) are weakly correlated across subjects (e.g., Bong, 2001; Goetz et al., 2007; Goetz et al., 2010; Gottfried, 1985 ; Guay et al., 2010). However, other scholars have conceptualized interest in academic activities as a general construct that is not tied to a particular subject (e.g., as intrinsic motivation in self-determination theory; Otis, Grouzet, & Pelletier, 2005; Vallerand et al., 1992; Vallerand et al., 1993) . Similarly, Ainley, Hidi, and Berndorff (2002) argued that besides interest in specific subjects, students may have a general individual interest in learning.",

Moreover, the relations between measures of different constructs within the same subject (within-subject relations) have been found to be stronger than relations between measures of the same construct in different subjects (between-subject relations; Goetz et al., 2007; Gottfried, 1990) . In line with this finding, Marsh and Yeung (1996) found more support for subject-specific factors that generalize across different affective-motivational constructs than for construct-specific factors that generalize across different subjects. However, none of the studies followed the integrative approach precisely as defined in the present study (see Fig. 1c ) and simultaneously investigated relations across different affective-motivational constructs while accounting for the multidimensional and hierarchical structure of the constructs. Therefore, to provide a more comprehensive picture of the different affective-motivational constructs and their interrelations, a structural model that simultaneously captures the complex interplay of general and subject-specific components across different affective-motivational constructs is needed.",

In the EVT, for example, previous achievementrelated experiences indirectly affect the corresponding academic self-concepts as well as interests, anxieties, and other subjective task values. Subsequently, the subjective task values and academic self-concepts influence students' choices, task investments, and performance, all of which are important for academic achievement .

First, general academic self-concept has usually been found to be positively related and general academic anxiety has been found to be negatively related to indicators of general academic achievement and, although slightly less so, to indicators of subject-specific academic achievement. Regarding academic interest, as this construct is usually considered to be subjectspecific, there is little empirical evidence for relations between general academic interest and indicators of students' academic achievement. Second, positive relations have been found for subject-specific self-concepts and subject-specific interests and negative relations for subject-specific anxieties and indicators of corresponding academic achievement. Regarding relations between subject-specific self-concepts and anxieties with achievement in noncorresponding subjects, weaker relations have usually been found than between these constructs and achievement in the corresponding school subjects. Regarding relations between subject-specific interests and achievement in noncorresponding subjects, empirical studies on enjoyment, an emotion closely related to interest, have indicated slightly negative correlations between enjoyment in mathematics and achievement in verbal domains as well as between enjoyment in verbal domains and achievement in mathematics (Goetz et al., 2007; Goetz et al., 2010) . Third, relatively little is known about how subject-specific self-concepts, interests, and anxieties are related to general achievement. The scarce empirical findings have suggested positive correlations between subject-specific self-concepts and general academic abilities, nevertheless slightly lower than between subject-specific self-concepts and achievement in corresponding school subjects. Of note, empirical knowledge about the relations of academic self-concepts, interests, and anxieties with academic achievement measures has been acquired primarily from studies that have applied unidimensional measurement models. When the nestedfactor model, which partials out the substantial amount of general variance from the subject-specific measures of academic selfconcepts, has been used, a more differentiated picture of the relations between subject-specific self-concepts and measures of academic achievement has emerged. Specifically, lower correlations between subject-specific self-concepts and corresponding academic achievement measures as well as close to zero correlations with general academic achievement and achievement in noncorresponding subjects have been found (see Brunner et al., 2009, in Table 1 ).",

In particular, by synthesizing the insights gained from applying these two approaches separately, we were able to propose a new structural integrative model-depicted in Fig. 2c -that could parsimoniously depict the complex interplay of general and subjectspecific academic self-concepts, interests, and anxieties. Importantly, the developed integrative nested-factor (INF) model allows for both within-subject and (hierarchical) between-subject relations to be investigated simultaneously and can be used to tackle research questions that cannot be addressed by the within-or between-subject approach alone. First, the INF model can help answer questions about the generality and specificity of affective-motivational constructs. In particular, the model disentangles the variance in subject-specific measures of academic self-concept, interest, and anxiety into components that (a) generalize across different subjects for a specific construct (i.e., construct-specific variance), (b) are common to different affective-motivational constructs within a specific subject (i.e., subject-specific variance), and (c) are specific to a particular construct in a particular subject (i.e., construct-and-subject-specific variance). In other words, the INF model can help to answer questions such as how much of the observed heterogeneity in measures of affective-motivational constructs in the student body (a) is com-mon to a certain affective-motivational construct across subjects, (b) is shared by different subjects across constructs, or (c) can be attributed to a specific construct in a specific subject. Second, the INF model provides a more differentiated picture of the relations between the subject-specific self-concepts, interests, and anxieties because it accounts for the general level of each construct in the subject-specific measures (and thus controls for this source of variance). Third, the INF model may provide information about relations between subject-specific components that are shared by different affective-motivational constructs.",

Therefore, in the fourth step, we investigated the validity of the model-defined general and subject-specific factors with respect to their relations to two types of school achievement measures: school grades and standardized test scores. Moreover, we determined whether some of the relations between the achievement indicators on one side and the affective-motivational construct scale scores on the other could be attributed to the reliable construct-and-subject-specific variance components of these measures. By doing so, we were able to empirically underscore how the integrative perspective on students' affect and motivation can help us better understand the well-documented relations between students' achievement and affective-motivational measures in as much as these relations can be attributed to different constructs, different subjects, or the specific aspects of a certain subjectspecific construct.",

Each of these four models contained three first-order factors that represented academic self-concept, interest, and anxiety (in the respective subject or at the general level). Latent factors were measured 6 Although it has been documented in meta-analytic research (with the majority of studies coming from English-speaking countries) that self-reported grades can be positively biased to a certain extent (Kuncel, Cred\u00e9, & Thomas, 2005) , some recent research from German-speaking countries has demonstrated that self-reported school grades are not subject to systematic reporting bias (Dickh\u00e4user & Plenter, 2005) . Moreover, even if self-reported grades might show some response bias, self-reported grades demonstrate convergent validity as they generally predict educational outcomes as well as actual grades do (Kuncel et al., 2005 ). 7 Please note that the estimation of all models in S3 and S4 resulted in a warning message issued by Mplus indicating that there were more parameters than independent pieces of observation. However, simulation studies seem to suggest that this message can usually be ignored without affecting the results (Muth\u00e9n (2013) ). Moreover, for the integrative model the residual variance of the mathematics self-concept scale score was estimated to be slightly negative (\u00c00.008) in S4 and thus out of the range of admissible parameter estimates. To overcome this problem, we constrained this residual variance to 0 in S4. The model fit of the constrained model was good (see Table 3 for model fit statistics).",

The correlations between academic self-concept, interest, and anxiety in the specific-subject models were modest to strong with the highest positive correlations between academic self-concept and interest (ranging from .55 in the German model in S1 to .85 in the mathematics model in S2; see Table 4 ) and the lowest negative correlations between self-concept and anxiety (ranging from \u00c0.33 in the French model in S1 to \u00c0.67 in the French model in S2; see Table 4 ). These findings underscore that the affectivemotivational constructs under investigation share common variance within a certain school subject. Academic self-concept, interest, and anxiety at the general level had somewhat lower correlations on the whole than the subject-specific factors (only the correlations between general academic self-concept and interest were substantial; see Table 4 ). Specifically, general academic self-concept was positively correlated with general interest (ranging from .39 in S3 to .67 in S2; see Table 4 ) and negatively correlated with general anxiety (ranging from \u00c0.38 in S3 to \u00c0.10 in S2; see Table 4 ). Interestingly, general interest was weakly positively correlated (S1 and S2) or correlated near zero (S3 and S4) with general anxiety (see the General Discussion for a discussion of this finding).",

Crucially, the nested-factor models apply the rationale of the CT-C(M\u00c01) model to disentangle the variance attributable to the general component of a certain construct (e.g., IN_A b ) from variances attributable to subject-specific components of the construct (e.g., IN_M b , IN_F b , IN_G b ). The specification of no method factor for the measures of the general component of a certain construct represents that part of the CT-C(M\u00c01) model that represents the ''method minus one\" and makes it possible to identify the nested-factor model and to obtain unique solutions for all model parameters. This approach has been recommended for ''applications in which the standard method is obvious because of theoretical considerations\" (Eid et al., 2003, p. 56) . For example, measures of general academic interest (e.g., ''I am interested in most school subjects\") are excellent operationalizations of the general component of academic interest.",

Second, the factor loadings for the subject-specific factors were also large (ranging from .35 for AX_M1 in S2 to .89 for SC_F1 in S4; see Tables  B9, B10 , and B11), thus demonstrating the multidimensional nature of the constructs with respect to specific subjects. Third, the subject-specific components for each construct were negatively related across the different subjects in all models (ranging from \u00c0.52 for the correlation between SC_F b and SC_G b in S2 to \u00c0.06 for the correlation between IN_M b and IN_F b in S4; see Table 5) , thus pointing to a separation of the constructs across subjects.",

Specifically, these construct-and-subject-specific variance components are contained in the residual terms of the manifest variables in the INF model. It is a typical problem in such cases that correlations between residual variances and other variables (e.g., the measures of academic achievement) cannot be directly estimated because the corresponding model parameters may be (empirically) underidentified. To overcome this problem, we examined the modification indices and the expected parameter change (E.P.C.), as provided by Mplus, for the correlations between the residual variances of the subject-specific indicators and the measures of academic achievement. Specifically, the E.P.C.s for the proposed model modifications provide an approximate estimation of the relations between the construct-and-subject-specific variance components and academic achievement because, according to classical test theory, the part of the residual variance that is comprised of random error is assumed to be uncorrelated with other constructs or any other random errors. Thus, these approximately estimated correlations (E.P.C.s) indicated the role of the construct-and-subject-specific components of the constructs. Specifically, juxtaposing the E.P.C.s with the correlations between subject-specific scale scores and the achievement measures showed how well the general construct factors and common subject-specific factors were able to account for the correlations between subject-specific scale scores and achievement indicators.",

However, the overlap across the constructs at the general level was somewhat weaker, indicating a greater distinctiveness of the constructs at the general level. Whereas a higher general level of academic self-concept corresponded as expected with higher levels of general academic interest and lower general anxiety in school, it is interesting that general academic anxiety was only weakly positively correlated (S1 and S2) or was correlated near zero (S3 and S4) with general academic interest. This result was unexpected. One tentative explanation is that general interest represents the general importance that students assign to the subjects so that students who acknowledge that subjects are important to them tend to worry more and feel more anxious about the outcomes. It may also be possible that the positive correlation between general interest and anxiety is an expression of emotional intensity in both constructs.",

Regarding the generality and subjectspecificity of academic interest and academic anxiety, however, Fig. 4 .

A vital contribution of the present study was, therefore, that we integrated the subject-specific and general approaches of academic interest and academic anxiety (and, of course, academic self-concept) by applying nested-factor models to represent the hierarchical relations between the general and subject-specific construct components. Our results showed that all these constructs indeed share very similar structural characteristics: (a) a multidimensional nature with respect to different subjects, (2) a hierarchical structure of each construct with general academic self-concept, interest, or anxiety at the apex of the hierarchy, and (3) a strong separation of the subject-specific components of each construct. In other words, academic self-concept, interest, and anxiety seem to be simultaneously organized in a subject-specific way (i.e., part of the variance of subject-specific measures is specific to the subjects) and generalize across different subjects (i.e., part of the variance of subject-specific measures is common to different subjects).",

This result is in line with previous studies (e.g., Green et al., 2007) and may reflect the different nature of the constructs: Whereas academic anxiety seems to have the characteristics of a general trait and is thus characterized by a general disposition to experience anxiety in different subjects (see Sarason & Sarason, 1990; Zeidner, 1998) , academic self-concept seems to be more dependent on subject-specific experiences and feedback (see Shavelson et al., 1976) . Regarding academic interest, although the dispositional character of the construct is usually distinguished (e.g., Krapp, 1999; Schiefele, 1996; Todt & Schreiber, 1998) , a strong object-relatedness is also emphasized (e.g., a group of similar subjects or a specific subject or topic) so that the idea that interest might generalize across different subjects is usually rejected. However, our results revealed some common variance in interest across distinct subjects (e.g., mathematics and German). This general interest in many subjects may be an expression of a more global trait such as curiosity or another construct from the framework of intellect (see Mussel, 2013) , and it would reveal itself in a general tendency to enjoy learning and collecting new information independent of content.",

First, in line with results from the within-subject models, the INF model points to subject-specific components of different affective-motivational constructs as sharing common variance. This finding underscores the commonality of the subject-specific compo-nents across the affective-motivational constructs. The common subject-specific factors can be interpreted as representing students' global affective-motivational appraisals that express the affectivemotivational experiences of the students in a specific subject. The negative relations between these factors demonstrate a strong separation of the common subject-specific components. It is important, however, to note that the overlap between subject-specific selfconcepts, interests, and anxieties depends on the way the subjectspecific constructs are conceptualized. Whereas the INF model disentangles the general variance from the subject-specific variance in the subject-specific scale scores, in the models using the withinsubject approach, the subject-specific factors reflect a mixture of a certain construct's general and subject-specific variance. Thus, in the present study, the subject-specific factors in the withinsubject models were ''pulled\" toward the corresponding correlations of the general components, resulting in a stronger overlap between the subject-specific self-concepts, interests, and anxieties in the INF model than in the within-subject models.",

Specifically, the general components at the top of the hierarchy and the global affective motivational appraisals of specific subjects, rather than components that are specific to a certain construct in a certain subject, accounted for the major part of the reliable variance in the subject-specific scale scores of the affective-motivational constructs. Especially the subject-specific variance in the selfconcept measures seemed to be almost completely shared with other affective-motivational constructs and was not unique to self-concept in a specific subject. That is, students did not seem to show any individual differences in their subject-specific perceptions of competence that could not be explained by their general beliefs about their competence in most subjects or their affective-motivational appraisal of the subject. Moreover, not only did the general construct components and the common subjectspecific components show psychologically meaningful relations with indicators of students' achievement, but they (rather than the construct-and-subject-specific components) also explained the major part of the relations between the subject-specific scale scores and student achievement. In other words, the factors representing general components at the top of the hierarchy and the global affective-motivational appraisals of specific subjects sufficed to almost completely account for the relations between subject-specific affective-motivational constructs and achievement indicators. The construct-and-subject-specific components of affective-motivational constructs thus do not seem to play a central role in explaining the well-documented relations between student achievement and affective-motivational measures. For example, the correlation between students' scores on the mathematics self-concept scale and the mathematics achievement test depended mostly on individual differences in students' general academic self-concept and their global affective-motivational appraisals of mathematics rather than on individual differences that were specific to their self-concept in mathematics.",

Despite these similarities, however, there were also some sample-specific results. The largest discrepancies emerged in the correlations between the general self-concept, interest, and anxiety (both in the general-level model and the INF model): Whereas the corresponding correlations had the same direction in all samples (apart from the general-level model's interest-anxiety correlation, which was slightly negative in S3 and positive in the remaining samples), the strengths of the relations varied somewhat across the samples. It seems that the assessment context and sample-specificity may have influenced the results, as the correlations from S1 and S2 were more similar to each other, and these samples were both obtained from the Luxembourg school-monitoring program, which follows a rigorous standardized study protocol each year. Moreover, the slight differences in the result patterns of S3 and S4 may have been the result of the fact that S3 was a representative samples and S4 was a convenience sample, as well as the restrictions in the age ranges in these samples.",

First, the generalizability of the results from this study may be limited by the fact that the data were obtained only from samples of adolescents in Luxembourg in the ninth grade. For example, there are indications that the relations between the language-specific self-concepts may depend on the role of the languages in the various curricula and societies. In Luxembourg, both German and French play important roles in school and society. Our results are congruent with results from other studies that have investigated self-concepts in languages of high importance (Brunner et al., 2010; Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2001; Marsh & Yeung, 2001 ). However, results from studies in which one language was clearly more dominant (Goetz et al., 2010; M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, & K\u00f6ller, 2006) indicate positive correlations between the self-concepts (but also see Xu et al., 2013) .

Previous research has supported these self-concept predictions (e.g., Brunner et al., 2008; Brunner et al., 2009; Byrne & Worth Gavin, 1996; Marsh, 1990b; Marsh & Ayotte, 2003; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985; Marsh et al., 1988) and has indicated that these predictions may also hold for academic anxiety and interest (Goetz et al., 2007; Goetz et al., 2010) . With respect to the INF model, we would therefore expect that the influence of the general constructs on the general and subject-specific measures would remain constant across age levels. Moreover, we would also expect that the intercorrelations between the subject-specific affective-motivational constructs would be more negative for older than for younger students.",

Recall that the nested-factor academic selfconcept model can be interpreted in terms of an academic selfconcept profile (also see Brunner et al., 2009) . Likewise, the nested-factor models that we introduced for academic interest and anxiety are able to statistically decompose the profiles of academic interest and anxiety, respectively: The general anxiety factor and the general interest factor reflect the mean level of interest or anxiety across different subjects, whereas the domain-specific interests/ anxieties can be seen as forming a particular profile. Consequently, the common subject-specific factors from the INF model can be interpreted as synthesizing the subject-specific profiles across different constructs. The implementation of nested-factor models, therefore, allows researchers to tackle important research questions concerning students' developmental dynamics. For example, previous research (Brunner et al., 2008; Eccles, 1994; Lubinski, 2004; Marsh & Yeung, 1997b; Nagy et al., 2006) has indicated that students' academic achievement profiles, but also their motivational profiles, contribute to their choices of particular learning environments. Therefore, if educational researchers wish to paint a more complete picture of students' academic development, both the general and the subject-specific components of the constructs need to be considered. Nested-factor models (construct-specific or the INF model) thus allow researchers to simultaneously investigate the differentiated effects of affective-motivational constructs at the general level and the profiles of the corresponding subject-specific constructs on the academic development of students. Moreover, the INF model will allow researchers to simultaneously and parsimoniously study the complex developmental dynamics of affective-motivational constructs and do this across multiple constructs in multiple dimensions (i.e., general and different subjectspecific components).",

For example, nested-factor models can be used to investigate effects from dimensional comparison theory (M\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2013) as they incorporate the general component and the hierarchical structure of a construct (see Brunner et al., 2008 , for their test of the internal/external frame of reference model [I/E model] with the nested-factor academic self-concept model). As the effects of dimensional comparisons are usually investigated with respect to academic self-concept (see Marsh, 1988; Miller, 2000, and Schurtz et al., 2014 for exceptions), the need to examine the generalizability of the I/E model in the context of other psychosocial variables has been expressed (see M\u00f6ller, M\u00fcller-Kalthoff, Helm, Nagy, & Marsh, 2015; Xu et al., 2013) . The proposed nested-factor academic interest and anxiety models and the INF model seem to be well suited for this research endeavor.",

Our results are, therefore, limited to these three constructs. We hope, however, that in the long run, this model will contribute to the development of an open structural architecture of students' affect and motivation that formally organizes the numerous constructs under a coherent theoretical or at least psychometric umbrella. It would be important to extend this model by including additional affective-motivational constructs such as achievement goals, additional value beliefs (e.g., utility value), motivation types as defined by self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2002) , or diverse academic emotions. For example, results from previous research have implied that different affective and motivational constructs (e.g., enjoyment, boredom, anxiety, values, autonomous and controlled motivations, achievement goals) may differ in their degree of generality and subject-specificity (e.g., Bong, 2001; Chanal & Guay, 2015; Goetz et al., 2006; Green et al., 2007; Guay et al., 2010 ; but see also Goetz et al., 2007) . Thus, a psychometric integration is needed to obtain a fuller and more nuanced understanding of students' affective-motivational experiences and the relations between different affective-motivational constructs at different levels of the construct hierarchy. Doing so would help to verify the generalizability of the tentative conclusion from the present study in the context of more affective-motivational constructs and formally capture overlapping information, commonalities, structural differences and similarities, or even redundancies between additional affective-motivational constructs. In other words, the present INF model can be seen as a first step toward unifying the plenitude of findings that have been obtained for affectivemotivational constructs. See Table A1 .",
