Within the external frame of reference, students conduct social comparisons, i.e., they compare their accomplishments with those of their classmates. This external reference provides information allowing them to construct academic self-concepts. For example, if their verbal achievement is higher than their classmates', their verbal self-concept will also be higher.

Based on external comparisons with one's classmates' achievements in math, low math ability tends to lead to a low math self-concept. Based on internal comparisons between one's own achievement in math and one's achievement in verbal domains, low math ability seems to lead to an increase in the verbal self-concept. The relative weight of the two comparison processes explains the moderate or nearly zero correlation between math and verbal self-concepts found in a variety of studies with different age groups conducted using different methodologies in a variety of countries (Bong, 1998; Faber, 1992; K\u00f6ller, Klemmert, M\u00f6ller, & Baumert, 1999; Marsh, 1986 Marsh, , 1990b Marsh, Walker, & Debus, 1991; M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001b; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1990 , 1995 Tay, Licht, & Tate, 1995; Williams & Montgomery, 1995) . Marsh (1990a) argues that the relative strength of each frame of reference explains the low correlations between verbal and math self-concepts that have been observed in empirical research, since internal comparison leads to verbal/math self-concept correlations that are substantially lower than the correlations between verbal and math achievement levels.",

                "text": "Most studies testing the I/E model have investigated math and the native language. Results support the hypothesis that the academic self-concept should be split into a mathematical and a verbal component (Marsh, 1990a) . In most studies, the native language has been English, but results are also available from studies conducted in non-Englishspeaking countries, with languages such as German (Faber, 1992; M\u00f6ller & K\u00f6ller, 2001b) , Norwegian (Skaalvik & Rankin, 1992 , 1995 Skaalvik & Valas, 1999) , and Chinese (Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2001; Yeung, Lee, & Wong, 2001 ). An interesting extension of the I/E model was presented by Bong (1998) . She asked students (about 55% of the participants were of Hispanic origin) to report (a) their domain-specific self-concepts in direct reference to social and dimensional comparison frames and (b) their self-efficacy judgments for diverse subjects including English, math, and Spanish. At the level of subject-unspecific math and verbal selfconcepts, the I/E model was confirmed, at least in part. At the subject level, however, the selfconcepts for the specific subjects could only partly be integrated into a single verbal factor and a single math factor. The Spanish domain, in particular, failed to fit into the higher-order factors. Precisely this aspect was taken up by Marsh and Yeung (2001) in their reanalysis of the Bong data. They found support for an extension of the I/E model to Spanish. In their path analysis, Spanish self-concept was negatively affected by math achievement and verbal achievement (including history, English, and other verbal achievements). Conversely, Spanish achievement had a negative effect on math and verbal self-concept. Bong's US sample was ethnically quite heterogeneous; therefore, it remains unclear whether the participants' native language was Spanish or English. However, the most important new feature is the extension of the I/E model to Spanish as a separate domain. and Yeung et al. (2001) studied the cross-cultural generalizability of these results in a longitudinal study with a large sample of Hong Kong high school students. I/E effects were analyzed in three subjects: math, Chinese (native language), and English (as foreign language). Both studies found positive effects of achievement in math, English, and Chinese on self-concepts in the corresponding subject, but negative effects on self-concepts in the other subjects, therefore extending the I/E model to nonnative languages. Even within the verbal domain, Chinese achievement had a negative impact on English self-concept, as did English achievement on Chinese self-concept (see also Yeung, Chui, Lau, McInnerney, Russell-Bowie, & Suliman, 2000 , who found evidence that the self-concept constructs in the two languages are distinct). stated that, in the case of Chinese and English, it did seem possible to extend the I/E model. They concluded that their Hong Kong sample \"provides an ideal setting for testing this extension in that both Chinese (the native language) and English (the nonnative language) are so important in the high school curriculum and in Hong Kong society more generally\" (p. 550). However, it remains unclear whether this extension of the I/E model is valid only for the special case of Chinese as a native language and English as a foreign language. The symbols, grammar, and semantics of these two languages are so different that it might be inappropriate to conclude that achievements in native and nonnative languages generally produce these I/E effects on the corresponding self-concepts. In the case of German and English, for example, positive influences might in fact be expected between achievement in English and the self-concept in German, and vice versa. This would be the case, for example, if a student's excellent English grades gave him the impression that he was talented in languages in general, thus raising his German self-concept as well. Therefore, the first aim of our study was to analyze whether the I/E model can really be extended to two more closely related languages, namely German as a native language and English as a nonnative language. With regard to the results of the path analysis, an extension of the classical I/E model to two verbal subjects will presume positive paths from achievements to corresponding self-concepts and negative paths from German (English) achievement to English (German) self-concepts.",

In the hierarchical self-concept model proposed by Marsh (1986) , physics is one facet of the higher-order math self-concept, and since many topics in physics require mathematical knowledge and reasoning, it seems reasonable to regard physics as an applied domain of mathematics. Marsh and Yeung (2001) argue that limiting the I/E model to one numerical domain (usually math) and one verbal domain is not inherent to its logic. Until now, however, no attempt has been made to integrate more than one mathematical subject into the I/E model. Bong (1998) attempted to incorporate chemistry into the higher-order math self-concept (along with algebra and geometry). This would seem to be a rational approach, because the correlation between math and chemistry self-concepts is at least as high as their achievement correlation.",

The domain-specific academic selfconcept for each subject was measured with a 5-item scale that was adequately reliable (internal consistency in terms of Cronbach's alpha was exactly .90 for all four subject-specific self-concept measures). No explicit social or dimensional comparisons were verbalized in the items. The wording of the five items was as follows: \"I would much prefer math if it weren't so hard;\" \"Nobody's perfect, but I'm just not good at math;\" \"With some of the topics in math that I don't understand, I know from the start that I just won't get them;\" \"Math just does not appeal to me;\" \"Even if I do my best in math, I do not perform very well.\" Students responded to each item on a 6-point scale with labeled extreme points (\"disagree\" to \"agree\"). The wording of the items for the four subjects was strictly parallel; only the school subject (i.e., math, physics, German, English) was changed. Scores were reverse-coded, so that higher values indicate a higher self-concept. The items made no explicit reference to social or dimensional comparison. Previous studies have provided evidence for the validity of the scale. M\u00f6ller and K\u00f6ller (2000) , for example, reported correlations of r=.60 between academic selfconcept scores and achievement indicators (grades) for a different set of subjects (German, math, history, and physics). More importantly, in the present study, correlations between domain-specific academic self-concepts and self-reported grades were between r=.48 for German and r=.58 for math (r=.49 for physics; r=.53 for English).",

Self-efficacy beliefs in the verbal and numerical domains are often highly correlated (Bong, 1998; Marsh, Walker, & Debus, 1991) .

It is therefore important to examine whether using self-report data entails significant disadvantages. Some US studies have shown that students tend to overestimate their GPA (see Dobbins, Farh, & Werbel, 1993; Flake & Goldman, 1991; Frucot & Cook, 1994; Goldman, Flake, & Matheson, 1990; Shepperd, 1993; Trice, 1990; Zimmerman, Caldwell, & Bernat, 2002) . For example, Zimmerman et al. (2002) report relatively low correlations of r=.62 between self-reported GPA and school records. In particular, students with poorer achievement tend to overestimate their grades. Some authors interpret such overestimations as self-enhancing strategies like impression management (Shepperd, 1993) . However, other studies have found quite high correlations between self-reports and actual grades. For example, Frucot and Cook (1994) reported correlations of between r=.74 and r=.91. Kirk and Sereda (1969) obtained even higher correlations of between r=.93 and r=1.00. Overall, the value of self-reported grades per se should not be called into question. In the German school system there is no equivalent to the GPA used in US schools. Grades are given in the form of whole numbers for single subjects (German, mathematics, English, physics, biology, sports, music, etc.). Therefore, the students in our study do not have to report a rather abstract GPA, as in the Zimmerman et al. (2002) study, for example, but were asked to state a concrete number pertaining to a single subject, and with a very familiar connotation (1=excellent; 2=good; 3=satisfactory; 4=sufficient; 5=poor; 6=insufficient). This process seems to lead to a relatively high correspondence between self-reports and actual grades. Helmke (1992) obtained correlations of between r=.75 and r=.97 for self-reported and actual math grades. In the German literature, we were unable to find any study reporting such low correlations as those found in the Zimmerman et al. (2002) study.",

Ten of the N=83 students (38.6% female) overestimated their mathematics grade, while six of them underestimated their grade. In no case was the difference greater than one grade. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between math self-concept and the individual difference between actual and self-reported grades (r=.08, ns). Likewise, there was no difference between the self-concepts of students who reported their grade correctly, and students who over -or underestimated their grade, as an analysis of variance showed [F(2,82)=.28, ns].

It might be argued that surveying grades and self-concepts in the same session is problematic. In our view, though, it is more likely that students tend to present themselves consistently if grades and self-concepts are assessed in parallel. In this case, grades and self-concepts should correspond to a relatively high degree (see Marsh & Yeung, 1998, p. 729) . Such a consistent response pattern should lead to even higher correlations between grades and self-concepts in the corresponding subject and thus to stronger effects of the social frame of reference. Whether or not this tendency is present in our data remains unclear. From this perspective, though, the use of self-reported grades should have led to a more conservative estimate of the effects of an internal frame of reference. Effects of dimensional comparisons may be even less likely when students under-or overestimate their grades.",

All analyses were based on empirical covariance matrices, and maximum-likelihood algorithms were used for parameter estimation. Instead of constructing item parcels, we used all items to obtain indicators of the latent self-concept variables; that is, each of our four self-concept factors (math, German, English, physics) had five indicators. Grades, on the other hand, were included as single indicator variables without any measurement error 1 . Following Marsh, Balla, and Hau (1996) and Marsh, Balla, and McDonald (1988) , we used the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; Tucker & Lewis, 1973) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) to evaluate goodness of fit, but we also present the F 2 -statistic and the degrees of freedom. According to the authors mentioned above, a sufficient model fit is indicated by TLI values above .90 (some authors recommend .95) and RMSEA values below .08. Since the SEM analyses ignored the hierarchical character of the data (students nested within classes, and classes nested within schools), we conducted some additional HLM path analyses to obtain unbiased estimates of standard errors for the path coefficients from grades to academic self concepts, and to test whether these coefficients varied across classes. We are aware that several multi-level SEM approaches have been proposed recently (see, e.g., Kaplan, 2000) , but there is consensus that multilevel SEM still has substantial limitations, as Kaplan (2000, p. 148) states: \"Most important perhaps is the fact that multilevel structural equation modeling does not currently allow variation in slope parameters across groups. (...) Thus, unlike standard multilevel regression analysis, multilevel structural equation modeling is an intercept-as-outcomes model only.\"",

The ICCs varied from .07 to .15 for self-concepts and from .08 to .18 for grades, meaning that most variation in the variables was between students within classes. These findings underline the well-known fact that teachers typically base their grades on a class-specific frame of reference and that students build their self-evaluations on social comparisons with their classmates (e.g., Marsh, 1987) . Table 1 shows the correlations among all achievement and self-concept variables in the four subjects as well as their means and standard deviations. Grades in German schools range from 1=\"very good\" to 6=\"poor\", but are reverse-coded in the present study, so that positive correlations are to be expected between the grade and the self-concept in a given domain. All correlations between grades in the four subjects are positive (between r=.27 and .53), as are the correlations between the self-concepts within the numerical subjects (math/physics: r=.51) and within the verbal domain (German/English r=.39). At the same time, the correlations between self-concepts in opposing domains tended to zero (from r=-.08 to r=.09), and were substantially smaller than correlations between achievements across these subjects (r=.27 to r=.34). Correlations between grades and self-concepts within the numerical and the verbal domain respectively were all positive, whereas the correlations between grades and self-concepts across the numerical and verbal domains were small and non-significant, with the exception of the negative correlation between math grade and German self-concept.",

We thus conducted a series of confirmatory factor analyses testing different kinds of models using the software package Mplus (Version 3.0). The Mplus package was used because it allows taking into account the hierarchical character of our nested data and provides unbiased estimates of standard errors. These analyses were based on n=1330 students with complete data on all self-concept items. Since the amount of missing data (less than 10%) was quite small and selectivity analyses did not reveal any variable that predicted the missingness pattern -thus suggesting that data were missing completely at random (see Rubin, 1987 ) -we applied listwise deletion. Additionally, we reran the SEM analyses based on covariance matrices estimated by means of the EM algorithm commercially available in the SPSS software (cf. Enders, 2001 ). Furthermore, we reran all analyses based on class-centered self-concepts scores that were thus corrected for class-specific effects. Because findings were the same for all different kinds of analyses, we decided to present the findings based on nonclass-centered complete data 1 . We started with a four-factor model, with each domain representing a unique dimension. Although this model revealed a reasonable degree of fit (F 2 =1639.92, df=164, p<.001; TLI=.91, CFI=.92; RMSEA=.082, .079-.086), the modification indices regarding the covariances of uniquenesses clearly suggested that a model with further method factors would substantially improve the model fit. Since the wording of the items for all four self-concept scales was exactly the same -with the necessary exception of the subject name (German vs. English vs. physics vs. math) -we analyzed an additional model with four self-concept factors plus five method factors 2 . This model brought about a substantial improvement in goodness-of-fit (F 2 =942.61, df=144, p<.001; TLI=.95, CFI=.96; RMSEA=.065, .061-.069; F 2 -difference=697.31, df-difference=20; p<.001). Note that the correlations among all method factors, as well as the relations between self-concept and method factors, were a priori set to zero; that is, we only allowed the four self-concept constructs to correlate with one another. The completely standardized factor loadings of this model are presented in Table 2 . The correlation coefficients among the latent self-concept factors were r=.52 between math and physics; r=.37 between German and English; r=-.17 between math and German; r=-.01 between math and English; r=-.01 between English and physics; and r=.02 between German and physics. This pattern again underlines the distinctiveness of the verbal and the numerical domains. In a further analysis, we tested a model with only two self-concept factors (numerical vs. verbal) and five method factors. This model displayed a very poor fit (F 2 =7543.39, df=149, p<.001; TLI=.52, CFI=.62; RMSEA=.193, [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] [197] , indicating that a model with four latent self-concept facets was much more appropriate.",

Using Mplus, we analyzed a model with five method factors and four academic self-concepts, in which the self-concept factors were predicted by grades. Note that all effects of grades on method factors were set to zero. In order to take into account the nested structure of our data, we reran the analysis using the HLM software as suggested by Bryk, Raudenbush, and Congdon (1994) . Table 3 presents coefficients of the completely standardized Mplus solutions and (in parentheses) HLM coefficients relating self-concepts to grades. The model fit was quite satisfactory (fit indices from Mplus: F 2 =714.47, df=214; p<.001; TLI=.93; CFI=.95; RMSEA=.063, .058-.068). Clearly, the different statistical approaches produced almost the same results. In the case of different results we decided to refer to the HLM analysis because this analysis is more likely to represent the hierarchical character of the data. As predicted by the I/E model and in hypothesis (d), path coefficients from all achievement indicators to the corresponding self-concepts are positive and significant (between .49 and .68, see Table 3 ). More importantly, and in line with hypothesis (f), the negative path coefficients from achievement in German and English to self-concepts in math and physics provide support for central assumptions of the extended I/E model. As shown by the path coefficients presented in Table 3 , achievement in math also had the expected negative influence on self-concept in German and English, while physics achievement had only a small but significant negative effect on German self-concept but not on the English self-concept (according to the HLM analysis). Interestingly and in line with hypothesis (g), math achievement positively affected physics self-concept, and physics achievement positively influenced math self-concept. In our German sample, German achievement had no significant effect on the English self-concept and English achievement had a small but significant positive path to German achievement (according to the HLM analysis).",

Table 4 presents fit indices for the two-group analysis.

Firstly, achievement correlations between all subjects were positive and significant. For each subject, achievement had a positive effect on the corresponding self-concept, as predicted by the external frame of reference. Internal frames of reference were obviously used as well: Math achievement had a negative effect on self-concept in the native language, and achievement in the native language had a negative impact on math self-concept. More interestingly, and going beyond the established findings for math and the native language, our study demonstrated negative influences of achievement in math on self-concept in English as a foreign language, as well as of achievement in both languages on math and physics. Although the pattern of results was in line with the I/E model, physics achievement only had very small (and for English non-significant) negative influences on the verbal self-concepts. One possible explanation for this might be that the students participating in the study only had two physics lessons per week, compared to four or five lessons in each of the other three subjects. Therefore, physics may be perceived to be less important than math, for example, and may thus have only a very small impact on self-concepts in the verbal domain. When interpreting results like this, the small effect sizes should be taken into account.",

Remember that in Marsh and Yeung (2001) as well as in and Yeung et al. (2001) , negative relations were found between achievement and self-concept in two subjects within the verbal domain. In the present investigation, no significant negative effects emerged within the verbal or numerical domains.

This result -and particularly the small but positive path from English achievement to German self-concept -contrasts with the findings of and Yeung et al. (2001) , who reported relatively strong negative effects within the verbal domain -namely, of achievement in Chinese and English on the non-corresponding verbal self-concept. It appears that Hong Kong students emphasize the domain-specificity of these two verbal self-concepts, whereas our German participants seem to regard German and English ability as less distinct. Such beliefs in the subject-specificity of abilities may explain the different results. Students who consider German and English to be fairly similar do not need to contrast their selfconcepts in the two verbal subjects to any significant degree. M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, Streblow, and Kaufmann (2002) investigated the impact of students' ability beliefs, i.e., whether or not students think of math and verbal abilities as positively correlated, on the impact of dimensional comparisons. Ability beliefs were shown to play an important role here: Students who considered math and verbal ability to be domain-specific factors displayed stronger negative path coefficients from grades to academic self-concepts in the other domain. Dimensional comparisons seem to be less important for students with less specific ability beliefs. Therefore, it might be worth carrying out further studies to analyze whether such ability beliefs moderate the links between achievement and self-concepts across and within domains. One important finding here may be that German and English are considered more similar than English and Chinese. This would of course seem reasonable in view of the contrasting linguistic structures, symbols, etc. A further difference between the present results and those of Marsh and Yeung (2001) , was that Marsh and Yeung found negative relations between achievement and self-concept in Spanish and English in a sample where some of the participants were native Spanish speakers and others were native English speakers. In our study, in contrast, only students with German as their native language and English as their first foreign language participated. Evidently, this constellation does not lead to the negative effects observed in the relations between Chinese and English, or to the positive effects discussed above.",

The only positive path from achievement in one subject to self-concept in the other was the small effect of English achievement on German self-concept. The effect of German achievement on English selfconcept was non-significant and negative. There is no doubt, however, that achievements in native and foreign languages are rooted in similar basic competencies (e.g., verbal intelligence, phonological awareness, see Sasaki, 1996) and are thus positively correlated. It appears that, in their everyday school life, students are not aware of this similarity, but perceive native and foreign languages to be more distinct subjects than math and physics. One reason may be that the acquisition of a foreign language suggests different teaching strategies than the correct application of the native language. One promising post hoc interpretation of this unexpected finding relates to the counterbalancing effects of positive and negative effects of achievement on self-concepts in other subjects. In the case of comparisons between math and verbal domains, negative effects may occur, with students reducing their self-concept in their weaker domain and raising their self-concept in their stronger domain. In the case of comparisons within the math or the verbal domain, positive effects may occur, with students raising (reducing) their self-concept in a subject if their achievement in another subject in the same domain is high (low). Such positive effects have already been shown for social comparisons (Collins, 1996) and in combination with the Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect (Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2000) -the phenomenon that a student in a high achieving class is more likely to develop a lower self-concept than an equally able student in a low achieving class. Marsh et al. (2000) suggest that, beside these negative effects, positive effects may occur when students evaluate their membership of a high achieving class positively. In this case, a basking-in-reflectedglory effect (Cialdini & Richardson, 1980; K\u00f6ller, 2004 ) may lead to students' assimilating their perception of their own ability towards the high standard of the class.",

These findings contrast with the typical I/E pattern of achievement in one subject reducing selfconcept in the other. They may also be based on an internal frame of reference or dimensional comparisons. This positive effect means, for example, that a student who is very good in math may develop a physics self-concept that exceeds his actual physics achievement, thereby assimilating his perception of his physics ability to his math achievement. The underlying psychological process may be that students who are good in math or physics attribute good grades in both subjects to similar competencies, such as inductive reasoning, numerical thinking, and spatial ability. Students with good math grades may infer a high level of competence in such basic skills and believe that they can apply these skills in physics, too.

This was the case for the experimental study by M\u00f6ller and K\u00f6ller (2001a) which was elicited by the correlational studies on the classical I/E model. These experiments help to improve our understanding of what is actually taking place in students' minds. The current study also delivers an interesting correlational pattern, in particular the positive paths of math (physics) achievement on physics (math) self-concept. The next step could be to test the psychological processes through experimental manipulation of task-specific self-concepts by varying achievement feedback on one task of the same domain. Therefore, further experimental investigations might help to analyze the positive achievement -self-concept effects within a domain in a more direct manner and to specify conditions under which the classical I/E model should be improved or replaced by a model which can integrate such effects.",

The processes described in the classical I/E model suggest that the verbal self-concept will be lower when internal frames of reference are used. In contrast, the student may consider math competencies to be an indicator of basic competencies or as a sign of general intelligence. If this is the case and a high level of intelligence is seen as a predictor of verbal achievement and self-concept, for example, it could be assumed that the student tends to assimilate her verbal self-concept to her math self-concept. As such, beside negative effects based on dimensional comparisons, positive effects may also occur as the effects of dimensional comparisons between two domains. Negative effects may appear when a student perceives his achievements in one domain as an indicator of a different competency in the opposing domain. Positive effects occur when a student interprets his achievements in one domain as an indicator of similar competencies which are also useful in the other domain. Both positive and negative effects can be expected to take place in almost all dimensional comparison processes because some skills will always be necessary for achievement in both domains, whereas other skills will be diagnostic only for one of the two subjects. The sizes of both positive and negative effects may be dependent on characteristics of the respective domains. As such, the results of our analyses may only show the net effect of the two processes.",

                "text": "It seems worth considering this point in conjunction with processes of developmental differentiation in the students' self-concepts. Positive achievement-self-concept effects within a domain and negative achievement-self-concept effects between domains both should lead to an increasing differentiation of self-concepts. As a consequence of positive effects, students with good grades and a high self-concept in math, for example, may develop a high selfconcept in other subjects in the numerical domain (physics, chemistry, etc.) . As a result, they may develop a self-definition of being a 'scientifically talented' student. This implies a parallel decrease in the verbal self-concept caused by dimensional comparison effects and the underestimation of one's own verbal ability. On the basis of her expectancy-value model (e.g., Eccles, Freedman-Doan, Frome, Jacobs, & Yoon, 2000; Eccles, 1983) , Eccles shows significant motivational and behavioral consequences of academic self-concepts. People engage more in a content area if their confidence in their own domain-specific ability is high. It has been shown that the lower engagement of girls in science corresponds with their perceptions that science is more difficult than verbal domains (e.g., Eccles et al., 2000; Hannover, 2001) . Although there were no significant gender (or class grade) differences in our study, it can be assumed that the increasing differentiation of academic self-concepts through dimensional comparisons contributes to gender stereotypical self-concepts. Such differentiation processes affect behavioral variables like course choices (K\u00f6ller, Daniels, & Baumert, 2000) , and it can be assumed that stereotypical course choices associated with increased time spent on a domain contribute to ensuing differences in achievement.",

This procedure may lead students to concentrate on achievement differences between two domains and hence to develop differentiated selfconcepts. In fact, in our investigation, we firstly obtained self-concepts and then we obtained students' grades. Therefore, the correlations between the domain-specific self-concepts can not differ as a direct consequence of the different correlations of their grades within vs. across the domains. It may be that the mere presentation of the different subject names math, German, physics and English in a single session may foster dimensional comparisons when students estimated their self-concepts. Yet situations in which students are made aware of their achievements in several subjects at once are familiar to students and not at all artificial. Students receive a complete list of all subject grades with every report. It is conceivable that the scholastic situation itself triggers dimensional comparisons at such times. In addition, the positive effects show that negative achievement-self-concept effects across subjects are not prompted automatically when grades in two subjects are announced or remembered simultaneously. On the other hand, there is some evidence from empirical studies that have shown self-concepts to also display the typical I/E effects when grades or self-concepts were announced at different times. This holds for those studies using objective achievement data that is withheld from students. Negative achievement-self-concept effects across subjects were shown even in such studies (Skaalvik & Rankin, 1990 , 1995 . Likewise, a study by Mui, Yeung, Low, and Jin (2000) presented evidence for the I/E model when self-concepts and grades were measured with a time lag of four weeks.",

It is assumed that each self-concept variable is represented by a unique factor, thus resulting in two factors. The level-1 model (within individual) for person j in class k is then specified by: or Y jk = A jk S jk + r jk Thus, the first three item scores Y 1 , Y 2 , Y 3 are measures of the latent true score S 1 with measurement errors r 1 , r 2 , r 3 respectively. The second trio of scores Y 4 , Y 5 , Y 6 measures the second latent true score S 2 with errors r 4 , r 5 , r 6 . The measurement errors are assumed to be independent. The matrix A contains factor loadings. In our case, we obtained these loadings from previous CFAs that are shown in Table 2 . Note, however, that with the introduction of additional measured and latent variables, the model rapidly becomes very complex. The level-2 model (between students) specifies the influence of grades on the latent true scores of S 1 and S 2 . Let us suppose that we have grades from two different subjects: V and W. The multivariate model may then be written: Here, E k is a vector of regression coefficients that govern the relationship in class k between the latent self-concept variables and grades. For our study, these coefficients are presented in Table 3 in parentheses. The elements of E k can vary randomly from school to school, and the matrix T E contains their variances and covariances.
