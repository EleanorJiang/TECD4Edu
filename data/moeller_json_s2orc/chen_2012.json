The cross-domain effects of either ability or grades on ASC were negatively significant. Conclusions. Taiwanese 10th graders tend to evaluate their ASCs based on a mix of ability and achievement, with achievement as a mediator exceeding ability as a predictor.

Engagement in classroom learning activities is also affected by achievement via the mediation of ability self-concept (Skaalvik, 1997) . Marsh (1986) established an internal/external (I/E) frame of reference model depicting the relationship between achievement and self-concept in specific academic domains. Marsh conceptualized internal and external references as comparative processes, through which academic achievement affects self-concept. According to the model, greater achievement in an academic domain supports the establishment of a strong self-concept in that domain, with students not only comparing their achievement with their peers (external reference) but also with their own achievements in other domains (internal reference). Regarding external references, students who perceive themselves as capable in relation to their peers in one domain should have a stronger self-concept in that domain. As for internal references, students who perform better in one domain than in others should have stronger self-concepts in that particular domain. Researchers in several countries have given broad support to the I/E model across different academic domains and some empirical evidence supporting specific model extensions (Goetz, Frenzel, Hall, & Pekrun, 2008; Marsh, Kong, & Hau, 2001; M\u00f6ller & Savyon, 2003) .",

However, Brunner, L\u00fcdtke, and Trautwein (2008) report that both domain-general and domain-specific cognitive abilities play important roles in predicting ASC within the I/E model. In educational settings, grades (as final outcomes) are influenced by multiple factors: individual characteristics such as cognitive ability and achievement motivation; environmental variables such as classroom climate; learning and cognitive processes; and teacher-centred factors such as instructional strategies. Among these, cognitive ability is generally perceived as the most important resource affecting academic achievement, in turn making a significant contribution to ASC.",

This proposal was thought to purify predictions of achievement effects on ASC. Some researchers have emphasized the difference between cognitive abilities and school grades and their respective impacts on ASC (Hansford & Hattie, 1982; Marsh, 1987) . We believe that two goals can be achieved by treating ability and achievement as separate I/E model constructs: (1) purifying the effects of achievement on ASC, and (2) expanding the I/E model to include individual differences in characteristics such as intelligence, thus increasing the model's utility. It is also our belief that cognitive ability and achievement must be considered simultaneously when predicting ASC.",

Despite acknowledged factors, such as motivation, social economic status, and parental involvement, some researchers still describe cognitive ability as the primary predictor of academic success (Deary et al., 2007; Gagn\u00e9 & St P\u00e8re, 2002; Rohde & Thompson, 2007; Spinath, Spinath, Harlaar, & Plomin, 2006) .",

In Taiwan, cognitive ability test scores are sometimes used as references in self-evaluations of domain ability, especially by high school students who are choosing among academic tracks that require either strong maths or verbal skills. Accordingly, a primary motivation for this study is examining the influence of cognitive ability on school grades, and the influences of both constructs on ASC within an extended I/E model, using 10th-grade Taiwanese students as our sample. Shavelson, Hubner, and Stanton's (1976) multi-dimensional and hierarchical model has global self-concept (divided into academic and non-academic categories) at its apex. Examples of non-ASC include self-perceptions of moral characteristics, social popularity, and other personal factors. ASC refers to how people conceptualize their own abilities in a particular academic domain. Global ASC can be divided into specific domains (e.g., maths, language arts, science) that are measurable via responses to survey items such as 'Am I doing well in maths class'?

Regarding external frames of reference, Marsh and Parker (1984) have noted that students form their ASCs based on their relative perceptions of their own academic abilities compared to those of other students. Empirical evidence has been presented indicating strong correlations between maths and verbal achievement and between achievement and self-concept within individual domains (Shavelson et al., 1976; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1995; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) . In contrast, a very weak correlation has been observed between maths and verbal self-concepts (Marsh, 1986; Marsh & Craven, 1997) . Marsh (1986) developed his I/E frame of reference model to explain the relatively stronger correlation between maths and verbal achievement.",

External frame of reference refers to a social comparison process in which students compare their maths or verbal abilities with the perceived abilities of others. The model suggests that students who perceive themselves as capable compared to other students in a specific domain tend to have high self-concepts in that domain. It also suggests that students compare their self-perceived performance in one domain with their own performances in other domains-an internal frame of reference. For example, students who are better in maths than in verbal subjects tend to use relative perceptions of their abilities to form better self-concepts in maths, even though they may not be especially successful in maths classes. Internal and external references work jointly to establish an individual's self-concept in a particular domain.",

Findings on gifted/honour and special educational programmes during the past two decades have supported the use of Marsh's model to explain self-concept formation among academically able and disabled students (M\u00f6ler, Streblow, & Pohlmann, 2009; Plucker & Stocking, 2001; Williams & Montgomery, 1995) . In addition, multi-group structural equation models have been used to demonstrate the cross-cultural generalizability of the I/E frame of reference across 26 countries (Marsh & Hau, 2004) . M\u00f6ller and Savyon (2003) extended the model to include non-academic domains and found that academic achievement negatively influences such non-ASCs as honesty. Goetz et al. (2008) used an extended I/E model to argue that domain self-concept is a mediator of the achievement effect on academic enjoyment in specific domains. Marsh et al. (2001) applied the I/E model to examine relationships among maths, English, and Chinese achievement and their respective self-concepts, and M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann, and K\u00f6ller (2006) applied it to verbal domains such as German and English, as well as to maths-related domains such as Physics. M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, K\u00f6ller, and Marsh (2009) analysed 69 data sets from past I/E studies and found considerable support for the model (e.g., meta-analytic path coefficients based on all studies ranged from .49 to .61 for external frame of reference and \u2212.21 to \u2212.27 for internal frame of reference). I/E model generalizability has been examined longitudinally and shown to be stable over time (Marsh et al., 2001 ).",

For example, Gustafsson and Balke (1993) reported a correlation of .50 between measures of general cognitive ability and educational achievement, and Mackintosh (1998) reported correlations of .40 to .70 between intelligence quotient (IQ) scores and school grades. Despite Rohde and Thompson's (2007) finding that between 51% and 75% of variance in academic achievement is not accounted for by measures of cognitive ability alone, many researchers still argue that it is the main predictor of academic achievement (Deary et al., 2007; Garn\u00e9 & St P\u00e8re, 2008; Rohde & Thompson, 2007; Spinath et al., 2006) . Specific examples include Watkins et al.'s (2007) conclusion from a longitudinal study that intelligence influences future achievement, and Laidra, Pullmann, and Allik's (2007) assertion that cognitive ability is the most important factor determining academic achievement from elementary through high school. Bachman (1970) reported a positive correlation between cognitive ability and ASC (r = .41), but Spinath et al. (2006) have more recently described a weak (.18-.25) and positive association between cognitive ability and self-perceptions of ability. Results from Marsh's (1990a) longitudinal study indicate that cognitive ability impacts school grades and that both factors can be used to predict ASC. Brunner et al. (2008) recently created an alternative I/E model focusing on relationships between domain-general cognitive ability and domain-general self-concept, as well as between domain-specific cognitive ability and domain-specific self-concept. Although not explicitly mentioned, Brunner et al.'s results suggest that domain-specific cognitive abilities impact ASC in the same domain to a greater degree than domain-general cognitive abilities.",

We recognize that ability and achievement are associated in the same manner that many researchers conceptualize cognitive abilities as having an innate power to predict individual academic performance (Deary et al., 2007; Garn\u00e9 & St P\u00e8re, 2008; Rohde & Thompson, 2007; Snow, 1998; Spinath et al., 2006) . Marsh (1990a) and Marsh and Craven (1997) have also reported that cognitive ability impacts both school grades and ASC and that ASC can be predicted by cognitive ability and school grades. We therefore believe that establishing a link between cognitive ability and school grades and investigating them simultaneously will provide a more complete picture of the influences of cognitive ability and achievement on ASC within an I/E model frame.",

Group one students are more strongly oriented toward liberal arts/social studies, group two students toward maths and nonbiological science, and group three students toward maths and all sciences. In the 10th grade, Taiwanese students must select a specific academic track leading to the national college entrance examination, which determines college placement and majors that can lead to optimum professional futures. Tenth graders may evaluate their academic abilities or achievement from various sources in addition to their grades.

(2001) used high-stakes standardized exams to find support for the I/E model; they analysed achievement and self-concepts in maths, English, and Chinese classes. Marsh and Hau (2004) also found support for the I/E model using data from the Program of International Student Assessment database compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Chiu (2008) investigated the I/E model using data of Taiwanese students from the 2003 Trends in International Maths and Science Study (TIMSS) and compared them with data from 27 other countries that participated in the survey. According to her results, the cross-domain effect varied across different countries. Some limitations for the above research studies need to be mentioned. In Marsh and Hau (2004) and Chiu's (2008) studies, achievement measures were based on a compromise framework agreed upon by all participating countries, and therefore may not fully represent the achievement or self-concept realities of individual countries. Also, Chiu focused on maths and science only; no consistent results were found across countries, due to what she calls the supplementary relation between maths and science. Research studies have shown that the internal comparison is more obvious when the two domains in the I/E model are distinct such as maths and verbal abilities . To avoid these shortcomings aforementioned, our proposed I/E model extension addresses maths and Chinese language studies. In addition, we used school grades instead of international achievement test scores in our analysis.",

Each subscale includes six items that are parallel across all domains. Items were written to direct respondent attention to past accomplishments, including some forms of cognitive evaluations and affective reactions. We constructed Chinese versions for maths and Chinese language studies, with each item being identical except for the words 'maths' or 'Chinese'. Participants completed the scales based on a mix of how their abilities compare to those of other students and how their domain-specific abilities match up with their abilities in other domains. Example items are 'Compared to others my age, I am good at maths/Chinese'; 'I get good marks in maths/Chinese'; and 'Work in maths/Chinese class is easy for me'. Answers were given along a five-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Based on Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, and Tatham's (2006) suggestion that four items per factor is preferable for obtaining adequate identification and minimum coverage of construct, we included four items for each domain. Coefficient alpha reliability estimates for the data were .95 for maths and .92 for Chinese-both considered high. Lu and Ou (2003) designed the MDATB to measure the cognitive abilities of students to learn or succeed in different areas and to provide a baseline for educational/career guidance and counselling for high school students. The battery consists of several subtests, with reading comprehension and verbal reasoning sub-tests serving as verbal ability indicators. Numerical reasoning and maths application sub-tests were combined to serve as a single maths-ability indicator. Lu and Ou have reported satisfactory reliability and validity statistics for this instrument. Coefficient alpha reliability estimates for our data were .91 for maths ability and .90 for verbal ability.",

In the present study, the 95% confidence interval of correlation between the maths ability and maths achievement constructs is between 0.16 and 0.28, and the one between the verbal ability and Chinese achievement ranges from 0.10 to 0.22.

Model 3 answers whether school grades are mediators of the cognitive ability effects on ASCs within the I/E model (Question 2). To answer whether cognitive ability or achievement is a better predictor of ASC (Question 3), the following observations are particularly valuable. First, in Model 3, the effect of maths achievement was stronger than the effect of maths ability on maths self-concept (\u2424 = 0.60 vs. \u2424 = 0.23); the same was true for the effects of Chinese achievement and verbal ability on Chinese self-concept (\u2424 = 0.50 vs. \u2424 = 0.06). In other words, after controlling for the other constructs, achievement had a stronger association than ability with self-concept in the same domain. Second, according to a comparison of Models 1 and 3, the achievement-to-self concept paths in Model 1 were only slightly affected by the addition of maths and verbal ability constructs (Model 3)-specifically, decreased by 8% (from \u2424 = 0.65 to \u2424 = 0.60) for maths and 2% (from \u2424 = 0.51 to \u2424 = 0.50) for Chinese. After mixing Models 1 and 2 to produce Model 4, the path coefficients between achievement and self-concept in the same domain also decreased by small amounts: 11% (0.65-0.58) for maths and 4% (0.51-0.49) for Chinese. Third, results from a comparison of Models 2 and Model 4 clearly show reductions in path coefficients between ability and self-concept in the same domain: 38% (0.55-0.34) for maths and 64% (0.28-0.10) for Chinese (taking achievement and self-concept paths into account).",

The findings suggest that Taiwanese students who are strong in maths are more likely to have higher maths self-concepts, which may be explained (at least in part) by the fact that students who are competent in maths tend to receive higher grades in maths. The results also indicate that verbal ability directly influenced Chinese self-concept and partly influenced Chinese self-concept via Chinese grades. We therefore conclude that ability exerts significant direct and indirect impacts on self-concept in the same domain, with the indirect impact mediated by achievement. In other words, ASC formation cannot be interpreted solely by achievement or ability.",

Although both ability and achievement are sources of information for domain self-concept evaluation or development, in practice, information on achievement relative to specific classes is usually provided to students (mostly from teachers) more frequently than information on cognitive abilities as measured by aptitude tests and, therefore, has greater impact on ASC formation . Our results support arguments that (1) sources of information on internal and external comparisons are crucial to ASC, and (2) the impacts of internal and external comparisons on self-concept in a specific domain depend on the extent and frequency of information that students have access to (Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002) . There exist another possible explanation to the distinct explanatory powers of ability and achievement. Steven and Stigler (1992) describe Chinese students as perceiving different weights on ability and achievement: ability is not the major determinant of an individual's success-effort and final achievement play more important roles. Accordingly, how well students perform academically may exert a stronger influence than ability on their ASCs.",

That is, social comparison is emphasized when students know ability of the other domain. The same interpretation also applies to the evaluation of Chinese self-concept.

The content emphasis for MDATB maths ability items is similar to those in the national high school maths curriculum. However, the Chinese curriculum focuses on classical Chinese literature, which is slightly different than the modern Chinese language usage emphasized in MDATB. This difference may explain, at least in part, the lower association between verbal ability and Chinese self-concept that we observed. Although not discussed, M\u00f6ller et al.'s meta-analysis results (2009) showed that maths achievement is associated with maths self-concept in a stronger magnitude than is verbal achievement with verbal self-concept. We believe some characteristics of maths and verbal abilities may determine their relationship with self-concept in the same domain. For example, maths is somewhat harder than verbal/language studies and requires problem solving abilities not simply obtained through practice. Therefore, it is possible that the variance of maths performance is larger than verbal, leading to higher correlation between maths ability/achievement and maths self-concept.",

For an individual who has average ability, but achieve above-average grades, his/her domain self-concept is higher in comparison with students who have aboveaverage abilities but average grades. This was proved in a separate study using the same data as this study. The process behind these may involve factors determining the selection or weighting of the reference. Factors determining which reference to use may depend on the availability of the information, which is also applied to the comparison theories in other areas such as social psychology or organizational psychology (Goodman, 1974; Grienberger, Rutte, & Van Knippenberg, 1997) . Students obtain information about their grades from teachers' feedback or class performance more frequently than their ability test scores Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002) . Another speculation is that the relative importance of ability and achievement in students' perception is not equal. Although we observed different strength of crossdomain effects leading from ability and from achievement, our study does not provide evidence that these internal comparison processes are different.

A qualitative approach can also provide insights of possible factors influencing external and internal comparison processes. For example, it is likely that students who have extremely high grades attempt to compare themselves with high performing students. However, when they receive low grades, they engage in social comparison adopting low-performing students as criterion. Based on the predictive relationship extended from the I/E model, our findings provide possible directions of future research, for example, whether students' efforts involve in the development of ASC, and how students predict their success in one domain and in turn influence their selection of courses (or groups in Taiwan). In a society such as Taiwan, where maths achievement is more emphasized than verbal achievement, will the self-enhancement involved in self-evaluation impact more on maths ability/achievement?

Our results suggest that both cognitive ability and grades impact ASCs among Taiwanese 10th graders in three ways. First, ability influences self-concept in the same domain both directly and indirectly, the latter via school grades. Second, achievement seems to play a more salient role than ability in predicting self-concept in the same domain, even though cognitive ability test scores are considered valuable information for academic track selection. Third, increases in the effect of ability on self-concept in a domain occur once the cross-domain comparison is available. Students with lower verbal abilities tend to believe that their maths skills are good. A similar interpretation can also be applied to Chinese self-concept formation; although, the negative effect of maths ability on Chinese self-concept is weak.",

This may be especially true in the Taiwanese context. To enhance students' domain self-concepts, it is better to emphasize their academic achievements than their ability. Efforts toward enhancement should be aimed at interventions such as raising motivations and encouraging the use of learning strategies. More importantly, teachers should place less emphasis on social comparisons such as normative grade references and instead introduce self-improvement or task-absolute references when providing feedback on academic performance (e.g., see Martin, 2006; Martin & Liem, 2010) .

                "text": "Usually, students with strong maths abilities have strong verbal abilities. However, teachers should not assume equal ASCs across domains. For example, a student who is bright in maths may have below average maths self-concept when his/her verbal ability is relatively higher than maths. Predicting domain self-concept from ability in that domain tends to be more accurate when the ability in the other domain is considered. Teachers should learn to consciously deal with information from internal comparison (Dickh\u00e4user, 2005) and verify whether or not their impression of a student's ability in a given domain is accurate. pointed out premature domain specifications may result in giving up on a perceived inferior domain without examining one's ability/achievement accurately. The myth of 'maths person' or 'verbal person' may limit someone's possibility of development in the weaker domain. Since research has shown that ASC influences students' course selection in the future (Marsh & Yeung, 1997) , guidance should be provided to students who perceive themselves less capable in one domain due to crossdomain comparisons.",
