    "abstract": "Introduction. With regard to the interal/external frame of reference model of academic selfconcept development the present study aimed at testing its theoretical assumptions within the verbal domain-namely to analyze the relations between achievement and self-concept in the native language German (L1) and the foreign language English (L2). Due to inconsistent research findings in this field the focus of analyses was on identifying differential patterns of dimensional comparison processes as they might depend on students' achievement level in both subject areas and on students' gender. Method. Data were gathered in a sample of 256 ninth grade students from German inner-city grammar schools. For measuring students' self-concepts two subject-specific scales were used. For measuring their achievement in each language subject latest grades as well as teacher competency ratings were used. Relations among constructs were analyzed by means of a structural equation modeling approach including multiple group comparisons between the female and male subsample. Results. No dimensional comparison effects could be demonstrated. Neither negative contrasting nor positive assimilation effects across both language subjects occured. Furthermore, multiple group comparisons of structural equation analyses lent strong support for the invariance model. Thus, despite significantly apparent achievement and self-concept differences between female and male learners in the L1 German gender did not moderate the relations between achievement and self-concept variables across both language subjects. Discussion. In the female as well as in the male subsample self-concept formation in both language subjects appears to be mainly affected by social comparison effects. This finding not only confirms previous research results in the field, but also contributes to clarify the role of gender in the internal/external frame of reference model-concerning the issue of dimensional comparison within the verbal domain, at least.",

Among these self-beliefs the students' academic self-concept has beem evidenced as a cognitive-motivational key variable. In terms of self-perceptions and self-evaluations of one's own capabilities, it is multifaceted in nature and appears to be composed of distinct subconcepts -which in particular reflect the students' competence beliefs in a certain domain, subject, or with respect to a certain type of academic task (Byrne, 1996; Marsh & O'Mara, 2008) . These self-concept facets can be empirically separated. They are differentially correlated with corresponding performance variables and can explain a higher degree of achievement variances than, with regard to content, more general measures of academic self-concept (M\u00f6ller, Pohlmann, K\u00f6ller & Marsh, 2009; Valentine, DuBois & Cooper, 2004) .",

Provided that the students really perceive their outcomes in various subjects as different (Rost, Sparfeldt, Dickh\u00e4user & Schilling, 2005; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1992) , this dimensional comparison shall lead to a substantially negative relationship between the achievement in a weaker subject and the self-concept in a stronger subject -and vice versa. This seems paradoxical because, at first glance, theoretically inexplicable negative associations between academic achievement and self-concept variables can be traced back to dimensional comparison processes. From a cognitive-motivational perspective, dimensional comparisons will affect the students' academic self-beliefs beyond external references and, therefore, will additionally contribute to influence their learning activities in each subject area. For instance, a student who believes a particular subject being weaker will possibly display a lowered level of engagement.

Although sound evidence exists for the close connection between basic linguistic competencies in the L1 and foreign language acquisition (D\u00f6rnyei, 2005; Sparks & Ganschow, 2001) , so that the academic learning in both subjects are to be considered as rather similar, there is no reason to rule out the possibility that the students might perceive the academic tasks and outcomes, respectively, in the L1 and L2 in a different manner -and that their subject-specific self-concepts might also be affected by related dimensional comparisons. From this aspect, it might matter that, in foreign language learning classrooms, oral skills are assigned as more important and, thus, the students' competence beliefs in the L1 and L2 might yet reflect fairly different achievement experiences. The results from foreign language research at least point out that L2 learners, especially, reported those classroom situations as very challenging and critical elements in which oral language use is required (Brantmeier, 2005; Horwitz, 2001 ; Mac-Intyre, D\u00f6rnyei, Cl\u00e9ment & Noels, 1998) . However, the whole current self-concept research on internal comparison processes within the verbal domain only yields few and inconsistent findings. Those studies, in which the relations between achievement and self-concept variables in the L1 German and the L2 English were considered mostly showed no significant path coefficients, thus indicating that neither contrasting nor assimilative effects existed between the two subjects (Dickh\u00e4user, 2003; M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann & K\u00f6ller, 2006; Schilling, Sparfeldt & Rost, 2004) . On the other hand, one analysis revealed significant negative path coefficients between the achievement and self-concept variables in English and Spanish (Marsh & Yeung, 2001) . In this particular study, the student sample consisted of both Spanish and English native speakers, and the English achievement variable referred to all verbal school subjects. Through this, the result seemed to strongly confound either sample and method influences, and did not provide adequate evidence to support the occurrence of dimensional comparison effects within the verbal domain. Moreover, without such methodological limitations, in another research context significant negative path coefficients between the achievement and self-concept variables in Chinese (as a native language) and English (as a foreign language) had been repeatedly reported (Marsh, Kong & Hau, 2001; Xu & Marsh, 2009 ). Due to the fundamental differences between the two languages, this result appears to be very plausible in so far as the students' academic perceptions generally will emphasise the Just recently, in a longitudinal investigation of preadolescent students' achievement and selfconcepts in German and French, significant negative relations between prior achievement and later self-concept variables have been found, thus indicating the formation of language-specific self-concepts are affected by the dimensional comparison processes (Brunner, Keller, Dierendonck, Reicher, Ugen, Fischbach & Martin, 2010) . This result evidently contributes to clarify the question of dimensional comparison effects within the verbal domain. But it cannot claim to substantiate such effects with regard to the native versus foreign language issue because, in the Luxembourgian school system, where the study has been conducted, German and French both are already taught simultaneously as official languages on the primary school level. Nevertheless, this result underlines the need for further research on the individual, social, and contextual determinants contrasting effects between similar language subjects.",

Empirically, the females' superiority in verbal achievement domains is well proven (De Fraine, Van Damme & Onghena, 2007; Gambell & Hunter, 1999; Marsh, 1989; Schilling, Sparfeldt & Rost, 2006; Skaalvik & Rankin, 1994; Steinmayr & Spinath, 2008) .

Although some studies showed higher verbal self-concepts for females (Brunner, Keller, Hornung, Reichert & Martin, 2009; Byrne & Shavelson, 1987; (Helmke, Schrader, Wagner, Nold & Schr\u00f6der, 2008; Holder, 2005; Kurman, 2004; Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2004) . The fact that apparent achievement differences do not seem to lead to corresponding self-concept differences possibly indicates a tendency for the males to overestimate and for the females to underestimate their verbal competencies, respectively (Bornholt, Goodnow & Cooney, 1994 demonstrate dimensional contrasting effects between the verbal and math domain to amount for higher magnitude in the female subsample. In this study the self-concept variable has been operationalized in terms of task-specific self-efficacy expectancies, which are known to be hardly used for internal comparison (Marsh, Walker & Debus, 1991) . For that reason, the result did not offer conceptually sound evidence for gender-dependent differences in dimensional comparison effects on the level of subject-specific self-concepts.

The measurement model of the German and English self-concept variable each consisted of three item parcels (with 5+5+4 items). Similarly, the measurement model of the teacher competence ratings consisted of two item parcels (with 4+3 items). Because the self-concept items were all identically worded, the error terms between the German and English construct operationalisations were allowed to correlate (Marsh, Martin & Debus, 2001 ). Initially, structural equation analyses were calculated for the total sample. For further clarifying the potential effects of the gender variable in a second step, then, multiple group analyses were driven for both the teacher competence ratings and the school grades -each comparing an unconstrained moderator model and a fully constrained invariance model. Following conventional rules of thumb in structural equation modeling, a sufficient model fit should be achieved when the \u03c7 2 /df value is lower than 3, the TLI is higher than .90, the CFI is higher than .90, and the RMSEA is at least lower than or equal to .08 (Marsh, Balla & Hau, 1996) .",

Although previous research in this field often failed to demonstrate contrastive or assimilative comparison effects within the verbal domain, some empirical findings suggested the magnitude and direction of dimensional Concerning the scope of the internal/external frame of reference model within the verbal domain, these findings clearly confirm recent research results in the field (Dickh\u00e4user, 2003; M\u00f6ller, Streblow, Pohlmann & K\u00f6ller, 2006; Schilling, Sparfeldt & Rost, 2004) . Despite the females' higher proficiency and self-perceptions in German there were neither contrasting nor assimilative effects in the relations between L1 and L2 constructs -indicating that all students seemingly perceived their competencies in both subjects in an independent manner. Hence, their motivational beliefs should not operate across both languages. Especially in the case of the female students, their significantly different perceptions of own English and German competencies did not have any impact on the relations among variables. But before approaching any theoretically valid conclusion, these results need to be further replicated and refined. In order to overcome one limitation of the present study, such replication studies should be run with greater sample size from more than one grade level. They should also analyze the role of gender in dimensional comparison processes with regard to other cultural contexts and educational settings (Chiu, 2008) . They should, in particular, combine other L1 language subjects with the L2 English in order to test the generalizability of the present findings (Marsh & Yeung, 2001 ).",

Additonally, it would be interesting to also use qualitative research methods. They could help to thoroughly explore the individually relevant information (e.g. consensus or consistency information) students realize when considering intraindividually different achievement outcomes (Kelley & Michela, 1980; Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2002) . With this reservation, it would be then reasonable to gain more insight into the meaning of comparative information processing for the formation of students' self-concepts in the L1 and L2 subjects -and to determine its contribution to an incremental understanding of students' cognitive-motivational functioning in the EFL context (Gabillon, 2005; Mercer, 2011) .",

Whether they may also determine the formation of self-concepts across similar verbal subjects such as the native and non-native (foreign) language seems empirically less clear. Relevant research findings mostly fail to demonstrate contrastive or assimilative comparison effects within the verbal domain, but some studies suggest the magnitude and direction of dimensional comparisons being differentially affected by certain contextual and individual factors -such as the educational tracking level, the students' age or grade level and, in particular, the students' gender. Against this background, the present study aims to analyze the secondary students' achievement and self-concepts within the verbal domainnamely, concerning German as the native language and English as a foreign language. Using a structural equation modeling approach to the total sample as well as to the female and male subsample, it is intended to investigate (1) the occurance of dimensional comparison effects in the self-concept variables and (2) to test possible gender-dependent differences in the relations between achievement and self-concept variables across both subjects.MethodParticipantsThe study was conducted with a sample of N = 256 students (144 females, 112 males) from 20 ninth-grade grammar school classes of a large urban catchment. Their average age was 15.0 years (SD = 0.5). Their participation was on a voluntary basis and only with explicit parental consent. The predominant majority of participating students (N = 222) declared themselves to be born in Germany. With respect to the English and German achievement",
