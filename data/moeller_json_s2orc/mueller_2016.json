Over time, conceptualizations of self-concept have evolved into a complex view of how individuals perceive themselves-namely, that self-concept is multidimensional and hierarchical in nature, and that it is formed through internal valuations and external comparisons (Harter, 1989; Marsh, 1986 Marsh, , 1990 Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976) .",

Here, we are using the term saliency as a way to describe noteworthy characteristics of selfconcept that can change in relevancy and meaningfulness to students depending on environment and contextual comparisons. That is, certain dimensions of self-concept can become more or less important across different settings and under certain conditions. For example, according to the Big-Fish-Little-Pond-Effect (BFLP) (Marsh, 1987) , academic selfconcept of high ability students is particularly impacted by educational context, because it has been shown that high ability students fare better in more heterogeneous classrooms where external comparisons with peers are more favorable in terms of ability comparisons (e.g., Marsh, 1987; Marsh, Chessor, Craven, & Roche, 1995) .",

As discussed previously with respect to the BFLP-Effect, educational context may play a particularly important role in how these dimensional comparisons form among high ability students, especially as schools and districts increasingly utilize AP course programming to educate many of these same students (Curry, MacDonald, & Morgan, 1999; Davis & Rimm, 1989; Henderson, Winitzky, & Kauchak, 1996) . It is assumed that the educational context varies considerably between AP and regular education classes. Especially since interpersonal interactions between students and teachers differ, enriched curriculum is most likely present in AP courses, and differing ability comparisons among students may lead to different self-concept formation outcomes (Hertberg- Davis & Callahan, 2008) .",

Conversely, other researchers have found that comparatively, students who are not identified as having high ability because they have not been labeled as gifted or talented, and do not participate in any type of AP classes often have higher general social selfconcepts as compared to high ability students (Cornell et al., 1990; Ross & Parker, 1980) . Both of these findings have relevance for the present study for several reasons. First, some researchers (Marsh, Trautwein, L\u00fcdtke, Koller, & Baumert, 2005; Marsh et al., 2008; Trautwein, Ludtke, Koller, & Baummert, 2006) have suggested that high ability students may suffer from unrealistically high social (i.e., parental, teacher, peer) performance expectations, and exaggerated social pressures to excel. Second, diversity in differential standards of classroom assessment is likely to be found in regular versus AP courses (Hertberg- Davis & Callahan, 2008) . Collectively, all of these factors will not only have important influences on academic self-concept formation, but will also most likely differ across AP and non-AP classrooms.",

Specifically, we were guided by three research questions as they pertain to achievement and self-concept relationships under Marsh's conception of academic self-concept: a) does domain-specific achievement (math/verbal) predict domain-specific self-concept (math/verbal), b) does achievement in one domain (math/verbal) predict opposite-domain self-concept (math/verbal), and c) is domain-specific achievement (math and verbal) correlated, while domain-specific selfconcept (math/verbal) is not; all as a function of different AP course enrollments?

For example, it could be that these individuals have less confidence in their overall math ability, and may still be trying to evaluate where their academic strengths or weaknesses lie-in turn, as they do better in English or language arts, this appears to negatively impact their assessment of math ability.

As discussed previously, districts are increasingly using AP courses as the primary method of educating high ability and gifted adolescents. Third, present findings also raise some interesting questions about the ways that academic self-concept saliency might function differently for high ability students enrolled in AP English courses only. However, the nature of these findings might be impacted by potential measurement issues introduced with the verbal self-concept items.
