Although the base year NELS:88 survey contained a variation of the Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale similar to those in the earlier NELS:72 and High School and Beyond studies, items designed to measure specific domains of self-concept were not included in these earlier studies. The purposes of the present investigation are to evaluate implications of research presented here for self-concept theory, measurement, and practice. Toward this end, I begin by evaluating the psychometric properties of the self-concept responses in the NELS:88 and comparing these properties with those from parallel analyses that are based on Australian students.",

                "text": "Self-Concept Self-concept research has suffered from a paucity of theoretical models, psychometrically sound instruments, and appropriate statistical analyses. In an attempt to remedy this situation, Shavelson, Hubner, and Stanton (1976) reviewed theoretical and empirical research and developed a hierarchical, multifaceted model of self-concept. Selfconcept, broadly defined by Shavelson et al. , is a person's self-perceptions, formed through experience with and interpretations of one's environment. Shavelson et al. found only modest support for their hypothesized domains of self-concept. Much stronger support, however, comes from subsequent factor analyses of responses to instruments designed to measure specific domains that are based at least loosely on an explicit theoretical model such as the Shavelson et al. model (e.g., Boersma & Chapman, 1979; Byrne & Shavelson, 1987; Fleming & Courtney, 1984; Harter, 1982; Hattie, 1992; Marsh, 1989 Marsh, , 1990c Marsh, , 1992a Soares & Soares, 1982) . Reviews of this research (Byrne, 1984; Hattie, 1992; Marsh, 1990c Marsh, , 1993a Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) support the multifaceted structure of self-concept and indicate that selfconcept cannot be adequately understood if its multidimensionality is ignored. Particularly in educational research, the academic components of the model-their measurement, their structure, and their relation to external constructs such as academic achievement-have received considerable attention (e.g., Byrne, 1984; Hattie, 1992; Marsh, 1990c; 1993a; Marsh, Byrne, & Shavelson, 1988; Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) .",

(1976) model, were designed to measure preadolescent self-concepts (SDQI), adolescent self-concepts (SDQII), and lateadolescent-young adult self-concepts (SDQIII). SDQ research provided strong support for the multidimensionality of self-concept and for the Shavelson et al. model, but it also posed complications. The strong hierarchical structure posited by Shavelson et al. requires self-concepts in different domains to be substantially correlated, but the small correlations actually observed imply that the hierarchy must be much weaker than originally anticipated. For example, Math and English self-concepts in the Shavelson et al. model were posited to be substantially correlated so that they could be described in terms of a single higher order academic self-concept. Correlations between Math and English self-concepts, however, were typically close to zero, and confirmatory factor analyses showed that relations between multiple dimensions of academic self-concept could not be explained in terms of a single domain of academic self-concept. These results led to the Marsh-Shavelson revision of the Shavelson et al. model in which two higher-order components of academic self-concept-Math/academic and English/academic-were posited instead of only one (see Marsh, 1990c Marsh, , 1993a , for reviews of this research). Strong support for the construct validity of SDQ responses has led to widespread endorsement of this Australian instrument. Wylie (1989) , for example, evaluated the SDQs as being the strongest and most thoroughly researched self-concept instruments whereas Hattie (1992) concluded that the SDQs were \"the best set of measures available\" (p. 83).",

Support for the construct validity of multidimensional self-concept responses requires that academic achievement should be more highly correlated with academic components of self-concept than with nonacademic components of self-concept, and that academic achievement in particular domains should be more highly correlated with academic self-concepts in the matching domain (e.g., mathematics achievement and Math self-concept) than self-concepts in nonmatching domains. Although academic self-concept should be substantially correlated with both school grades and standardized test scores, relations with school grades are expected to be stronger because schools grades are a more salient source of feedback to students that also reflect motivational properties that are likely to be related to selfconcept (Marsh, 1987; 1990c; 1993a; Wylie, 1979) . Although not a focus of the present investigation, Marsh (1990a) used a longitudinal analysis to demonstrate that prior academic self-concept affects subsequent academic achievement beyond the effects of prior academic achievement. Whereas most research considers only a global component of academic self-concept or academic self-concept in only one specific domain (e.g., math self-concept), there is a growing body of research indicating the need to consider multiple dimensions of academic self-concept.",

According to the internal comparison process, however, good mathematics skills should lead to lower English self-concepts and good English skills should lead to lower Math self-concepts. In the path model used to test this prediction, the direct effects of mathematics achievement on English self-concept and of English achievement on Math self-concept were predicted to be negative. According to the model, high English accomplishments detract from Math self-concept and high mathematics accomplishments detract from English self-concept.

As I indicated in the discussion of the I/E model, even after individuals obtain information from various sources about their academic accomplishments, these impressions must be compared with some frame of reference. To the extent that individuals have different frames of reference, the same objective indicators of achievement will lead to different academic self-concepts. The social comparison theory underlying the big-fishlittle-pond effect hypothesizes that students compare their own academic ability with the academic abilities of other students in their reference group and use this comparison as one basis for forming their own academic self-concept. The big-fish-little-pond effect occurs when students have (a) lower academic self-concepts when they compare themselves to more able students and (b) higher academic selfconcepts when they compare themselves with less able students (Marsh, 1984; 1991; Marsh & Parker, 1984) . According to this model, individual student achievement is positively correlated with academic self-concept, but the contribution of school-average ability is negative. If a student attends a school where the average ability level of other students is high, then this student-according to the bigfish-little-pond effect-is likely to have a lower academic self-concept than if the same student attended a school in which the average ability is low. Support for the big-fishlittle-pond effect using various experimental and analytical approaches has been reported (Brookover, 1989; Davis, 1966; Jerusalem, 1984; Marsh, 1984; 1990b; 1991; Marsh & Parker, 1984; Reuman, 1989; Rogers, Smith, & Coleman, 1978; Schwarzer, Jerusalem, & Lange, 1983) . Marsh (1991) considered the influence of school-average ability on a much wider array of outcomes, using the High School and Beyond longitudinal database consisting of responses by the same high school students when they were sophomores (Tl), seniors (T2), and two years after the typical graduation from high school (T3). The major findings of this path analysis were that the effects of schoolaverage ability were not positive for any outcomes, and the effects were significantly negative for advanced coursework selection, academic self-concept, grade point average, educational aspiration, occupational aspiration, standardized test score, and university attendance. Subsequent analyses suggested that many of the negative effects of schoolaverage ability were mediated by academic self-concept, thus indicating the importance of academic self-concept as both an outcome variable and as a mediating variable that influences other desirable outcomes.",

It is important to emphasize that this concern is not one of mean differences in the level of self-concept that are related to gender. Rather, the concern is a more fundamental issue about the factor structure underlying self-concept; whether responses to the same instrument have the same meaning for boys and girls. Byrne and Shavelson (1987, p. 369) , for example, concluded that: \"Clearly, interpretations of mean differences in SC [self-concept] between males and females are problematic unless the underlying construct has the same structure in the two groups.\" Consistent with this perspective, Hattie (1992, p. 177-178) emphasized that \"the differences in means may not be as critical in the development of selfconcept as changes in factor structure.\" At a pragmatic level, the implications of this issue are profound. Unless there is reasonable support for the invariance of the selfconcept structure across gender, it may not be justified to compare self-concept responses across males and females. Such concerns about factor structure invariance are most appropriately evaluated by using confirmatory factor analysis to determine whether-and how-the structure of selfconcept varies according to gender (see Marsh, 1993b) . The minimal criterion of factorial invariance is that the factor loadings relating each indicator to its hypothesized factor is the same across all the different groups. Previous research has shown that Australian SDQ responses are reasonably invariant over gender (Marsh, 1993b) , but it is important to evaluate the generalizability of this finding to responses of U.S. students in the NELS:88 database.",

Although reasonable, these measures may confound initial ability and initial effects of the school that occurred between the start of high school and the administration of the tests. For the NELS:88 data, however, standardized tests were first administered when students were in eighth grade, thus providing a stronger basis for testing the big-fish-little-pond effect. Furthermore, because there are separate measures for the mathematics and English constructs (achievement, school grades, and self-concepts), it is possible to evaluate the domain specificity of the big-fishlittle-pond effect.

Because of the twostage probability sample in the NELS:88 design, standard errors that were based on the assumption of simple random sampling substantially underestimate the sampling variability in summary statistics and distort tests of statistical significance. To compensate for this bias, I divided the weight for each student by the estimated design effect of 3.858 (Ingles et al., 1992, p. 50) ; this reduced the nominal sample size from 17,544 to 4,547. It is important to emphasize that this nominal reduction in sample size affects only the size of standard errors and tests of statistical significance; it has no effect on the size of parameter estimates (e.g., coefficient alpha estimates of reliability, scale means, factor loadings, and path coefficients) that are the focus of the present investigation.",

The factor loadings are of central importance in the definition of each factor and the validation of the underlying factor structure. For comparisons across multiple groups, the minimal condition of factorial invariance is typically taken to be the invariance of factor loadings, although the invariance of factor correlations, factor variances, and uniquenesses are also of interest.

The approach used here (see Bentler, 1990; Gerbing & Anderson, 1992; Marsh, Balla, & McDonald, 1988; McDonald & Marsh, 1990; Mulaik, et al., 1989 ) (a) demonstrates that the solution is well defined by establishing that the iterative estimation procedure converges to a proper solution; (b) examines the parameter estimates from alternative models in relation to each other, to substantive a priori expectations, and to common sense; and (c) evaluates the chi-square and subjective indices of fit and compares values obtained from alternative models. Because no restrictive model with positive df is able to fit real data and will be rejected by a formal test of significance for a sufficiently large N, I placed more emphasis on subjective indices like the Tucker-Lewis index (Tucker & Lewis, 1973) , the relative noncentrality index (McDonald & Marsh, 1990) , and the parsimony relative noncentrality index (PRNI; Mulaik, et al., 1989 ) based on the relative noncentrality index (Marsh & Balla, 1991) . Tucker-Lewis and relative noncentrality indexes greater than .90 are typically interpreted as indicating an \"acceptable\" fit. Whereas the restric-tions and invariance constraints necessarily result in a poorer goodness of fit according to the chi-square and relative noncentrality index, the Tucker-Lewis index and parsimony relative noncentrality index incorporate penalty functions that are based on the number of estimated parameters so that it is technically possible for such constraints to result in better fits according to the Tucker-Lewis index and parsimony relative noncentrality index. The parsimony relative noncentrality index penalty function is apparently more substantial than the Tucker-Lewis index penalty function, so that the parsimony relative noncentrality index is likely to favor more parsimonious models (e.g., models with more invariance constraints compared with models with fewer invariance constraints) than the Tucker-Lewis index (for further discussion of these penalty functions see Marsh & Balla, 1991; McDonald & Marsh, 1990) .",

Whereas older respondents should be able to cope with the cognitive demands of negatively worded items, Marsh (1992b) reported factors defined primarily by negatively worded items for many different self-concept instruments and for respondents of different ages.

Because mathematics and English school grades had only a single indicator, the reliability of each of these measures was fixed at the arbitrary, but plausible value of .90 (see Joreskog & Sorbom, 1989) . Mathematics and English achievement tests scores were available for both 1988 and 1990, thus there were multiple indicators of the mathematics and English achievement constructs. Three correlated uniquenesses were posited in this structural equation model. On the basis of the support for the existence of a negative item effect in the self-concept responses in the initial CFA, I posited a correlated uniqueness relating the negatively worded item in the Math scale to the negatively worded item in the English scale. Also, correlated uniquenesses were allowed between the pair of 1988 achievement test scores and the pair of 1990 achievement test scores (i.e., mathematics and reading achievements collected at the same time were more highly correlated than corresponding achievements collected at different times).",

In all the models, each self-concept item was allowed to load on only the one factor that it was designed to measure and the five self-concept factors were correlated. In this particular model, the factor loadings and factor correlations were required to be the same across all four groups. Whereas the ability of this model to fit the data is discussed in further detail, the parameter estimates indicate that the self-concept factors are well defined. The factor loadings relating self-concept items to their corresponding factor-item validities-are all large (.47 to .88 in standardized form) and statistically significant. Also, the pattern of relations among the factors is consistent with previous research (e.g., Marsh, 1990a Marsh, , 1992a . The correlation between the two peer relations scales (Same Sex and Opposite Sex; r = .53) is the only correlation greater than .35. It is also of A) . In this solution, factor loadings and factor correlations were constrained to be equal across all four groups so that only one set of parameter estimates is presented. Factor variances and measured variable uniqueness were freely estimated for each of the four groups, therefore separate estimates are presented for each group. Covariances among uniquenesses representing the negatively worded items (not shown) were also freely estimated for each group. Parameter estimates are standardized in relation to a metric that is common across all four groups and differs from those that would result from standardizing estimates for each group separately in which constraints across groups would be lost (see Joreskog & Sorbom, 1989, p. 238-242) .",

It is, however, interesting to speculate about a possible explanation that could be evaluated in future research. The larger negative item effect in the U.S. data may reflect the fact that the NELS:88 survey contained only 21 of 102 items from the original SDQII instrument (and only 8 of the 52 negatively worded items). Whereas responses by Australians considered here were based on only 21 SDQII items, Australians actually completed all 102 items.

Similarly, some of the negative effect of school-average ability on academic selfconcept is mediated by school grades. This apparently reflects the common practice of \"grading on a curve\" or \"locally centering grades\" such that the average school grade does not vary much from school to school even though the average ability levels of students from different schools vary substantially. Thus, students with comparable academic ability (based on standardized achievement test scores administered prior to the start of high school) tend to earn lower grades in schools where the school-average ability level is higher, and they tend to earn higher grades in schools where the school-average ability is lower. In both Models C and D, however, there is still a direct, negative effect of school-average ability on academic self-concept in addition to the portion of this effect that is mediated by school grades.

The present study demonstrates that the big-fish-little-pond effect predictions generalize to self-concepts and achievement in particular school subjects.

Additional support for the construct validity of the selfconcept responses by only the U.S. students in the NELS:88 study comes from the empirical support of predictions derived from the I/E and the big-fish-little-pond effect models. From a construct validity perspective, these results support the validity of the models used to generate the predictions and the self-concept responses used to test the predictions.

The factorial invariance analyses indicate that the factor structure underlying the selfconcept responses is similar in both countries-except, perhaps, for the negative item effect. The comparison of the mean levels of self-concept indicated that U.S. responses were significantly higher, although the differences were small. It is also relevant that the small gender differences found in responses in each country were very similar. These results suggest that the formation of self-concept may be similar in the two countries, apparently reflecting the influences of reasonably similar cultures-at least for tenthgrade high school students.",

Individual studies, however, typically are based on small or idiosyncratic samples and have used weak self-concept instruments. Wylie (1979) , for example, concluded not only that there were no gender differences in total self-concept but also that existing research was inadequate for determining whether there were gender differences in specific domains of self-concept. Although such problems can be addressed in part by meta-analysis (e.g., Hattie, 1992) , generalizations are still limited by the quality of existing research. The present investigation-because of the size and representativeness of the NELS:88 and the quality of the measures-provide a stronger basis for investigating gender differences. Whereas earlier studies that were based on large, nationally representative samples (e.g., the High School and Beyond) evaluated gender differences in global measures of self-concept, these studies typically did not evaluate multiple dimensions of self-concept. Consistent with earlier claims (Marsh & Shavelson, 1985) that self-concept cannot be adequately understood unless its multidimensionality is considered, the present results show that gender differences in mean self-concept responses vary logically with the self-concept domain. The lack of gender differences in total self-concept reflect differences favoring girls in some areas and differences favoring boys in other areas.",

Although it is not surprising that academic self-concept is substantially associated with standardized achievement test scores and school grades, the particular pattern of results predicted by the I/E model is initially counter-intuitive. By articulating the internal comparison process, however, the results are more readily understood. If a student is exceptionally good at mathematics, then by comparison his or her moderately good accomplishments in English do not seem so impressive. Similarly, even if a student is weak in mathematics he or she may have an average Math self-concept if he or she is even weaker in all his or her other school subjects. This ipsative-like process helps explain why Math and English self-concept are so distinct and why people think of themselves as a \"math person\" or a \"verbal person\" even when there are only small differences in their mathematics and English abilities. Although the I/E model is typically evaluated in relation to either school grades or test scores, both grades and tests were considered here. The results (Figure 1 and Table 5 ) demonstrated that the pattern of results predicted by the I/E model was evident for both test scores and school grades, although the effects associated with school grades were typically larger. Whereas this support for predictions that are based on the I/E model is consistent with previous research, the present results are stronger because of the size and representativeness of the NELS:88 sample, the quality of the variables in the NELS:88 study, and the simultaneous evaluation of both standardized test scores and school grades.",

                "text": "The big-fish-little-pond effect also has important implications for both self-concept theory and educational policy. It is frequently assumed that attending schools where the average ability level of other students is high has positive effects on a variety of academic outcomes. In contrast, Marsh (1991) found that attending higher-ability schools had negative effects on academic self-concept, and that these self-concept effects mediated negative effects associated with other outcomes. These negative effects were observed for students of all ability levels and across a variety of outcome variables including academic achievement and subsequent university attendance (Marsh, 1991; 1993a) . Even though these negative effects of attending higher ability high schools may not generalize to all individual students or to all high schools, one should not assume that there are benefits associated with attending such schools-on average the effects are negative. Although the present investigation focused on the negative effects on academic self-concept, it extended previous results (e.g., Marsh, 1991) in several ways. Because the first wave of NELS:88 was collected when students were in eighth grade, it provided a clearer separation between the ability levels of students prior to attending high school and the effects of the high school. By considering school grades in addition to individual and school-average test scores, the negative effects of school-average ability on school grades (the \"grading on a curve\" or \"locally centered grade\" effect) could be separated from the big-fish-little-pond effect. Of particular relevance, the big-fish-little-pond effect showed that the effects of school-average mathematics ability were clearly differentiated from those of school-average English ability. Whereas attending a high-school where school-average mathematics achievement was high had a negative effect on Math self-concept it had no negative effect on English self-concept. Similarly, school-average English had a negative effect on English self-concept, but no negative effect on Math self-concept. In this respect, the results support the need to evaluate multiple dimensions of self-concept and combine aspects of the typical big-fish-little-pond effect with implications from the I/E model. It is also important to note some limitations of the present study and directions for further research. The design and particularly the choice of variables in large, commercial databases like NELS:88 are intended to serve such a diverse range of purposes that they may not serve the particular needs of an individual researcher. Thus, for example, the High School and Beyond study did not include domainspecific dimensions of self-concept, limiting its usefulness for testing many of the theoretical models considered here. In the present investigation, particularly the various LISREL analyses were hindered by the lack of multiple indicators for some constructs, and different strategies were demonstrated for dealing with this potential problem. Because the NELS:88 data were collected initially when students were in eighth grade, prior to the start of high school, the students sampled from a particular high school may not adequately represent that high school. Most students had attended the high school for less than two semesters when the second wave of data was collected. This design limitation dictates caution in the interpretation of the big-fishlittle-pond effect. The results also indicate that achievement and academic self-concept are related, but, because the academic self-concept items were only collected in the second wave of NELS:88 data, it is not possible to test the causal ordering of these constructs. Other research (e.g., Marsh, 1990a; 1993a) , however, suggests that if both academic self-concept and achievement scores are collected in multiple waves, then prior academic self-concept affects subsequent achievement beyond the effect of prior achievement. Whereas these limitations dictate that findings reported here must be interpreted cautiously, at least some of these problems should be overcome by the release of the augmented school data and the data collected in subsequent NELS:88 surveys with these same students (see Ingles et al., 1992) . It is also important to emphasize that in the present investigation I considered only a small fraction of the variables that are available to NELS:88 users that may influence the findings summarized here. Thus, for example, the gender differences observed here may interact with ethnicity or with a host of other NELS:88 variables, and there may be subgroups of students who benefit from attending higher ability schools who can be characterized according to other NELS:88 variables. More generally, the self-concept variables emphasized here should have important implications for many research and policy issues targeted in the design of NELS:88 (e.g., parental involvement; equity, access, and choice; school effectiveness; school climate; special education and gifted-talented programs; ability streaming; mainstreaming students with special needs; family configuration and single-parent homes; school persistence and dropping out; extracurricular school activities). Although the range of additional research is far beyond the scope of the present investigation, the present study provides examples of uses of the NELS:88 self-concept responses that may be helpful in this subsequent research.",
